      "The inventive R&B artist Ty Dolla $ign released his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cIt's \u2018Tycoon\u2019 season,'\u201d a beaming Ty Dolla $ign, declares.",
      "It is indeed. The inventive R&B singer has just released his fifth studio album, his first full-length solo release in five years. He chose \u201cTycoon\u201d for its title because the word encompasses his current state of mind. \u201cIt\u2019s like (being at) the top of your game,\" he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not only have I done all the stuff you could do in artistry, (but) there\u2019s still more to do.\u201d",
      "Call it confidence or swagger or showboating: The Grammy-nominated artist has a trove of multiplatinum records to his name from 2018 to the present, and recently, his controversial project with Kanye West, $, released two albums, \u201cVultures 1\u201d and \u201cVultures 2\u201d in 2024. They debuted at No. 1 and 2 on the Billboard 200, respectively.",
      "\u201cTycoon\u201d is classic Ty Dolla $ign. The album is what he's made a name for himself doing: a collection of ceaselessly catchy, NSFW R&B anthems about lust and love (both mostly lechery), stacked with A-list collaborations: Quavo,Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Travis Scott, Chlo\u00eb \u2014 the list goes on.",
      "Also among them: Rappers Kodak Black and Ty Dolla $ign's longtime kindred spirit YG. (Ty Dolla $ign and YG have worked together for a number of years, certainly going back to 2010's \u201cToot It & Boot It.\") For his latest album, the trio teamed up for \u201cSMILE BODY PRETTY FACE.\u201d It was one of the last songs to make \u201cTycoon,\u201d says Ty Dolla $ign, \u201cBut when we started messing with the beat. I was like, \u2018This has got to be YG.\u2019\u201d",
      "There's a romantic element to the song \u2014 with some of his explicitly sexual posturing. The same can be said about the lead single to \u201cTycoon,\u201d \u201cAll In,\u201d where Ty Dolla $ign's rich baritone considers devotion to a partner. \u201cThey say love don\u2019t cost a thing,\u201d he swoons on the chorus. \u201cAnd if it did, I\u2019d go all in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm always loving something,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn't all the way worked out for me yet.\u201d Love, then, is still a constant source of inspiration \u2014 enriched by the song's sample of Wayne Wonders\u2019 2002 reggae fusion track \u201cNo Letting Go.\u201d",
      "For Ty Dolla $ign, this new era means being a business \u201cTycoon\u201d as well. He's taken on his fair share of industry endeavors \u2014 like launching a label, EZMNY, with Motown Records executive Shawn Barron \u2014 and experiencing immediate success with its first signing, the R&B upstart Leon Thomas. His single, \u201cMutt,\u201d hit No. 11 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.",
      "Thomas told AP earlier this year about working with Ty Dolla $ign: \u201cI was around some epic legends in the field, and I feel like the best teacher is experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal there, with EZMNY, is to give the real artists a chance. Myself, I didn\u2019t make it until I was 27 and I was always good. I was always making music,\u201d Ty Dolla $ign says. \u201cAnd I just wanted to reach back to people that are actually great.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be a comeback in R&B very soon,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe're talking Leon specifically.\u201d",

      "\u201cI just want people to feel inspired after they hear it. I want them to believe in themselves after they hear it,\" he says. \u201cAnd believe in me. I'm always going to give you the best of the best.\u201d",

      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals.

      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",

      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker.

      "Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke have collaborated for over 30 years, but their latest film, \"Blue Moon,\" pushed their partnership to new limits",
      "Richard Linklater likes to joke that if he and Ethan Hawke didn\u2019t know each other so well, Hawke probably would have punched him during the making of \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d",
      "The two Texans have been friends and collaborators for over 30 years. They had made eight films together when they started \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d about the lyricist Lorenz Hart set over one night at Sardi\u2019s restaurant. It\u2019s a project they\u2019d been talking about for over a decade.",
      "One might assume that it would be all old hat between them. And yet this was a film, in select theaters Friday, that would require a vastly different dynamic.",
      "\u201cI was nagging. I was riding his (expletive). It\u2019s not the way I work usually,\u201d Linklater said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe film\u2019s small in scale. It seems minimalistic. But what was incumbent on Ethan was pretty massive.\u201d",
      "That punching thing, Hawke said in a separate interview, was completely true. He came to realize that Linklater was channeling his inner Sidney Lumet \u2014 a great actors\u2019 director, but a tough one.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to me. He didn\u2019t want us to take the work for granted, or that we were friends,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been listening to me talk about acting for 30 years and he wanted to give me a chance to really do it. To stop talking about it and do it.\u201d",
      "Hawke has never shied away from a challenge. When they were making \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in Vienna in 1994, Linklater remembered Hawke looking at the script and saying \u201cthis probably won\u2019t work\u201d but diving into it anyway. That\u2019s when he was sure he had found a kindred spirit, someone who ran towards the impossible.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that territory if you want to do anything that\u2019s different, something someone hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel like you\u2019re out on some limb going, \u2018We\u2019re risking a huge whopping failure.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Lorenz Hart was not Jesse the writer in the \u201cBefore\u201d movies. Here was a man who was both small in stature (the most generous reports say he was 5-foot-2-inches), balding, extremely self-conscious about his appearance and the biggest personality and wit in the room. He was a genius and an alcoholic who had made himself unemployable. And amid all of this, the times were changing, and he was being left behind.",
      "Every couple of years over the last decade, they would get together and do a reading of the script. Hawke loved the character and felt deeply that he was the right person to do it, but when it came time to take it out of the theoretical, he said, \u201cit got very scary.\u201d During the first couple of days of rehearsal, Hawke got terribly sick.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like my body knew this was about to be something really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event of the movie is Lorenz Hart and everybody\u2019s actually supporting this portrait.\u201d",
      "That included himself and his ego. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d would require a deconstruction, and disappearance of the movie star that is Ethan Hawke.",
      "The script from author Robert Kaplow takes audiences inside the famed Broadway theater district restaurant Sardi\u2019s on the opening night of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d in 1943. Hart is holding court with a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) waiting for his old collaborator Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) to come to the party.",
      "For over 20 years Rodgers and Hart were a prolific and successful songwriting team, behind musical hits and hundreds of classic songs, including \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic?\u201d \u201cThe Lady is a Tramp\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d It\u2019s one of the great artistic partnerships of all time. This film is about that breakup.",

Hart, meanwhile, would die eight months after the \u201cOklahoma!\u201d opening, at age 48.",
      "\u201cThe country is changing, and the jazz era is ending and a new era is beginning and one of these people is going to continue on to lead and the other is going to be completely left behind,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s so funny in the face of tragedy? That\u2019s where the screenplay really shines: The duality of this man. He\u2019s both absurdly jealous and simultaneously very supportive and loving. He\u2019s wickedly funny and suicidal. He\u2019s a homosexual in love with a woman. The correlation of opposites, that is Larry Hart.\u201d",
      "The production used old school Hollywood tricks to make the 5-foot-10-inch Hawke look tiny on a micro budget. He shaved his head to get that balding look. And they built a Sardi\u2019s set in Ireland.",
      "\u201cI always describe it as this little howl into the night of an artist being left behind. It\u2019s to live through your own extinction,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI hope people respond to it the way you would a beautiful Rodgers and Hart song. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s beautiful in a way, but it leaves you kind of devastated.\u201d",
      "Making a life in the arts requires immense sacrifice no matter how you look at it. And there\u2019s always the possibility that the culture will pass you by. Hawke, for one, said he\u2019s had three distinct moments in his career where he was pretty sure he was washed up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could do this for over 30 years and not feel it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThey come on like waves and you have to try to survive.\u201d",
      "The experience made him think of a lot of the people he came up with, who mentored him when he was starting out in the theater in the 1980s. Many of them, like Hart, were closeted, and they viewed their vocation not as a job but as a kind of spiritual calling. One stage actor he was thinking a lot about was the late Richard Easton, who he did a few plays with before he passed.",
      "\u201cWhen I was young, he said to me, \u2018One lifetime is not enough. It\u2019s not enough time to learn what you need to learn to be the kind of actor that you dream of being,\u2019\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great attitude. It creates a perpetual sense of learning and an ongoing process, and this part really did require everything that I\u2019d learned up until now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlue Moon\u201d is actually one of two Linklater movies about artists that will be in theaters this month. \u201cNovelle Vague\u201d (out Oct. 31), about the making of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d is about the beginnings of a career. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is about the end of one.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to art careers,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI think we all think we\u2019re just going to run the table and do this until the day we die. But things get in the way.\u201d",
      "One thing we don\u2019t have to worry about (yet) is a creative breakup between Linklater and Hawke. Linklater might have given his friend some tough love, but they never argued, and in the end it was worth it. Hawke lived up to the challenge and no one got punched.",

      "The former president gave new status to \u201cWTF With Marc Maron\u201d and to podcasts in general when he visited Maron's Los Angeles garage studio while still in office a decade ago. Obama brought the 62-year-old host, stand-up comic and actor to his Washington office for the last interview.",

      "Maron laughed as he acknowledged he was comparing his podcasting gig to the presidency.",
      "\u201cI think it's pretty similar,\u201d Obama said.",
      "The identity of the guest was not revealed until the episode dropped, and fans had been speculating. Obama was a popular guess, both because of his relationship with \u201cWTF\u201d and because Maron in an interview with Variety in July said Obama would be his ideal final conversation.",
      "The host explained the decision in an unusually brief and straightforward introduction to the episode.",
      "\u201cIt became clear that the guest we needed to have was singular,\u201d Maron said, \u201cin that he could address the importance of this being our final episode, but also address how we move through the world we're living in, as frightening as it is.\u201d",

She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",

Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",

Everything about Diane was creativity personified.\u201d - On Instagram.",
      "\u201cDiane, working with you will always be one of the highlights of my life. You are one of a kind, and it was thrilling to be in your orbit for a time.

      "\u201cHow do we say goodbye? What words can come to mind when your heart is broken? You never liked praise, so humble, but now you can\u2019t tell me to \u201cshut up\u201d honey. There was, and will be, no one like you.\u201d \u2013 in an Instagram post.",

      "ROME (AP) \u2014 For the first time in nearly 2,000 years, visitors to Rome\u2019s world-renowned Colosseum will have the opportunity to walk through a hidden imperial passage that once allowed Roman emperors to reach the ancient amphitheater unseen.",
      "The once-secret corridor \u2014 known as the \u201cCommodus Passage\u201d and named after the Roman emperor turned into a pop icon by Ridley Scott\u2019s movie \u201cGladiator\u201d \u2014 opens to the public on Oct. 27, marking an extraordinary milestone in archaeological preservation and access.",
      "Archaeologists at the Colosseum Archaeological Park explained that Roman emperors would use the passage to enter the arena unseen and protected, leading them directly to their reserved honor box overlooking the games.",
      "The passage was named after Emperor Commodus, who ruled alone between 180 A.D. and 192 A.D., when it was initially discovered in the 1810s. Commodus was known to be passionate about gladiators\u2019 games and history relates that while he was passing through the tunnel, someone attempted to assassinate him, but was unsuccessful.",
      "At the passage entrance, archaeologists discovered remnants of decorative elements directly related to arena spectacles, including depictions of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobatic performances. These artistic elements provided a fitting prelude to the brutal entertainments that awaited beyond, they noted.",
      "The corridor is shaped as an \u2019S\u2019 and continues outside the Colosseum arena, but its final destination remains uncertain.",

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",
      "When foreign assistance was frozen, Lesotho lost at least 23% of PEPFAR money, putting it in the top 10 countries for share of such funding cut, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Mapapali Mosoeunyane is among Lesotho residents who credit PEPFAR with helping save them. After learning she had the virus in 2009, she was certain dying was just a matter of time. Neighbors gossiped, she was fired, and she considered giving up her two young sons for adoption.",
      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",

She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",

      "But it\u2019s not clear how much the U.S. bridge programs will \u201cclose the gap,\u201d added Chikukwa, even as she\u2019s leaving Lesotho. Her role was eliminated because of the aid cuts. The South Africa UNAIDS office will oversee Lesotho, she said, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d be reassigned.",
      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",

      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily.

Like many miners, he chose his health over a job and steady paycheck. He fears diseases such as tuberculosis \u2014 a leading cause of death in Lesotho, attributed to weakened immune systems \u2014 may creep up on him if he interrupts treatment.",

      "The United Nations' food aid agency has warned that severe funding cuts are impacting its operations in six countries",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 The United Nations' food aid agency said Wednesday that severe funding cuts from its top donors are especially hurting its operations in six countries and warned that nearly 14 million people could be forced into emergency levels of hunger.",
      "The World Food Program, traditionally the U.N.'s most-funded agency, said in a new report that its funding this year \u201chas never been more challenged\u201d \u2014 largely due to slashed outlays from the U.S. under the Trump administration and other leading Western donors.",
      "It warned that 13.7 million of its food aid recipients could be forced into emergency levels of hunger as funding is cut. The countries facing \u201cmajor disruptions\u201d are Afghanistan, Congo, Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan, it said.",
      "\u201cWe are watching the lifeline for millions of people disintegrate before our eyes,\u201d Executive Director Cindy McCain said.",
      "WFP said it expects to receive 40% less funding this year, leading to a projected budget of $6.4 billion \u2014 after receiving some $10 billion last year, and it has been reducing what was a staff of 22,000 by about 6,000 posts.",
      "\u201cThis is not just a funding gap \u2013 it\u2019s a reality gap between what we need to do and what we can afford to do,\u201d McCain said in a statement. \u201cWe are at risk of losing decades of progress in the fight against hunger.\"",
      "The Rome-based agency says global hunger is already at record levels, with 319 million people facing acute food insecurity \u2014 including 44 million at emergency levels. Famine has broken out in Gaza and Sudan.",
      "In Afghanistan, food assistance is reaching less than 10% of people who are food insecure \u2014 meaning that they don't know where their next meal will come from, the agency said.",
      "WFP says it has received about $1.5 billion from the United States this year, down from nearly $4.5 billion last year, while other top donors have also cut funding.",

      "Health officials say the person was likely bit by an infected mosquito, but they also say the virus has not been detected in local mosquito pools and there is no evidence of ongoing transmission.",
      "The type of mosquito known to carry chikungunya is present in parts of the New York City metropolitan area, including suburban Long Island. The disease cannot be spread directly from one person to another.",

      "South Africa's health minister has called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab, a \"groundbreaking\" tool against the disease",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the highest prevalence rate.",
      "This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy 2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug for low-income countries.",
      "The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).",
      "Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds\u2019 catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses.",
      "\u201cWe plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,\u201d said the minister.",
      "\u201cAbout half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,\u201d said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.",
      "The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa\u2019s health system was significantly hit by the abrupt cuts to funding from USAID and other U.S. government sources in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country.",
      "Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir\u2019s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.",
      "The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that\u2019s already approved in the U.S. and Europe, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027.",
      "Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences\u2019 voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.",

      "According to Wendy Cupido, country manager for Gilead, the South African manufacturers that were evaluated in 2024 did not satisfy the technical specifications for the production of sterile injectables at that time. She said, though, that Gilead was still willing to look at further voluntary licensing if a South African manufacturer could develop the required capabilities and meet quality standards.",

      "\u201cIt is not a cure or a vaccine, but it could be a game changer if made accessible to all who could benefit,\u201d said Kiwango. \u201cFor many, lenacapavir expands choice, strengthens agency, and reduces barriers linked to stigma, disclosure, or daily adherence.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Police in France detained four people suspected in a plot targeting exiled Russian rights activist Vladimir Osechkin, who exposes abuses in Russian prisons, France's national anti-terror prosecution office said.",
      "The General Directorate for Internal Security, France's counter-espionage and counterterror intelligence service known by its French initials DGSI, has been the leading the investigation, the anti-terror prosecution office said on Thursday evening.",
      "It said the four men were detained Monday but gave no details about their nationalities, any possible motives for allegedly targeting Osechkin or whether the men are suspected of links to foreign spy services.",
      "Osechkin founded Gulagu.net, a rights group for prisoners in the notoriously tough Russian carceral system. Osechkin has long suspected that he could be targeted for possible assassination because of his work, even in exile in Biarritz, the beach resort town on southwest France\u2019s Atlantic seaboard where he lives.",
      "In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Osechkin said there have been repeated threats on his life since 2022, most recently in February this year.",
      "He believes that he remains at risk although French police carried out arrests in the wake of those death threats, adding that he and his family are often moved to safe houses when new threats emerge.",

      "Gulagu.net also helped bring Russian fugitive paratrooper Pavel Filatiev to France in 2022. Filatiev served in the Ukraine war before being injured, and later published accounts online of what he saw, accusing the Russian military leadership of betraying their own troops out of incompetence and corruption.",

      "In 1995, Murayama dealt with two major disasters: a massive earthquake in the western port city of Kobe that killed more than 6,400 people, and a Tokyo subway gas attack that killed 13 and injured more than 6,000 people. He came under fire for slow responses to both.",

      "Jer\u00ed, the 38-year-old president of Congress, then took office, promising to get a recent crime wave under control. He swore in Ernesto \u00c1lvarez, a ultraconservative former judge active on social media, as prime minister.",
      "\u00c1lvarez has not yet commented on it, but previously claimed said that Peru\u2019s Gen Z is a \u201cgang that wants to take democracy by storm\u201d and does not represent \u201cthe youth who study and work.\u201d",
      "Criticisms of Jer\u00ed and his government quickly emerged because he previously faced an investigation after being accused of a woman of raping her. The prosecutor's office dismissed the case in August, though authorities continue to investigate another man who was with Jer\u00ed the day of the alleged rape. Protesters also condemned Jer\u00ed because as a legislator he voted in favor of six laws that experts say weaken the fight against crime.",
      "Protesters demanded Jer\u00ed and other lawmakers resign and repeal the laws they say benefit criminal groups.",
      "During the protest, more than 20 women shouted \u201cThe rapist is Jer\u00ed\u201d or \u201cJer\u00ed is a violin\u201d \u2014 a slang expression in Peru where \u201cviolin\u201d means rapist. Protesters launched fireworks at police, who responded with tear gas and rubber pellets.",

      "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about outrage over abuse of power, corruption and killings,\u201d said Tafur, the protester.",

      "JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa on Thursday welcomed a U.S. bridging plan worth $115 million that would continue funding HIV treatment and prevention programs until the end of March, saying it was a sign of good bilateral relations despite recent tensions.",
      "The U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has been credited with saving more than 25 million lives over two decades of people with HIV, the vast majority in Africa. South Africa has the highest number in the world of people living with HIV.",
      "In January, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending all foreign aid for South Africa, including PEPFAR.",
      "While a temporary waiver was initially granted for the 90-day suspension, the US began terminating grants in late February 2025, and most funding remained frozen or stopped, leading to job losses and service disruptions.",
      "The U.S. previously contributed more than $400 million a year to South Africa\u2019s HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, or about 17% of the total funding according to the health department.",
      "As a result of the funding freeze, more than 8,000 health workers were laid off and the 12 specialized HIV clinics were closed that were run by nongovernmental organizations and funded by the now-shuttered United States Agency for International Development, USAID.",
      "South African Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters on Thursday that the cabinet welcomed the approval of the PEPFAR Bridge Plan by the U.S.",
      "She said the minimal warning period for countries to prepare their budgets was one of the primary complaints voiced when President Trump stopped PEPFAR funding, and the \u201cbridge plan\u201d sought to address that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a confirmation of the good bilateral relations between South Africa and the U.S. so that when we have complaints, they intervene and we find an amicable solution to the problem,\u201d Ntshavheni added.",
      "Although the minister struck a positive tone, relations between the two countries have been strained. Trump accused the Black-majority government of presiding over a genocide against minority white Afrikaners, even fast-tracking refugee applications for Afrikaners to resettle in the U.S.",
      "Along with suspending financial aid and imposing 30% tariffs on South Africa\u2019s exports to the U.S., Trump has denounced the country\u2019s stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. In 2023, South Africa filed a case with the ICJ, accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",

      "On Thursday, lawmakers in the 577-seat National Assembly rejected a no-confidence motion filed by the hard-left France Unbowed party. The 271 votes were 18 short of the 289 needed to bring down the government.",

      "Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024 backfired on him, triggering legislative elections that stacked the powerful lower house with opponents of the French leader but producing no outright winner.",
      "Since then, Macron\u2019s minority governments have sought to barter support bill by bill and have fallen in quick succession.",
      "That collides with the architecture of the Fifth Republic, founded in 1958 under Charles de Gaulle.",
      "The system was built for a strong presidency and stable parliamentary majorities, not for coalition horse-trading or a splintered house.",
      "With no single bloc near an absolute majority of 289 seats, the machinery is grinding against its design, turning big votes into cliffhangers and raising existential questions about the governance of France.",
      "For French voters and observers, it\u2019s jarring. France, once a model of eurozone stability, is now stumbling from crisis to crisis, testing the patience of markets and allies.",
      "To peel away opposition votes, Lecornu offered to slow the rollout of Macron\u2019s flagship 2023 pension law, which raises the retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "The proposed slowdown could push the law back roughly two years, easing near-term pressure on people nearing retirement while leaving the end goal intact.",

      "The turmoil engulfing Argentine financial markets began when voters in the manufacturing belt of suburban Buenos Aires \u2014 a region that for decades represented the dream of national industry nurtured by tariff protection \u2014 punished Milei in a provincial election last month.",

      "Over a year ago, markets cheered as Milei fulfilled his flagship promise to reduce the runway inflation that he inherited from his populist predecessors. Many Argentines \u2014 who had grown accustomed to supermarkets revising prices upward everyday \u2014 hailed Milei's program as a miraculous outbreak of normalcy in a notoriously topsy-turvy economy.",

      "Unemployment in Buenos Aires Province climbed to 9.8% in the second quarter of this year, compared to 7.3% during the same period in 2023, before Milei entered office. Salaries nationwide haven't kept up with inflation. Milei's major subsidy cuts mean that even if prices have stabilized, Argentines are paying more for bus fares, utility bills and healthcare.",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

      "Investors looked past a 22% drop in CSX\u2019s third quarter earnings Thursday and focused on the direction the railroad's new CEO might take it and the possibility of any strategic deals",
      "Investors looked past a 22% drop in CSX\u2019s third quarter earnings Thursday and focused on the direction the railroad\u2019s new CEO might take it and the possibility of any strategic deals.",
      "CEO Steve Angel promised to focus on making CSX the best-performing railroad. Without promising a merger, Angel said he would consider any strategic opportunities that make sense for shareholders. He also reminded investors that he ran industrial gas supplier Praxair for a decade before the opportunity to merge with rival Linde came up.",
      "\u201cThe way these things work \u2014 these strategic opportunities \u2014 you\u2019ve got to wait for the right timing. You\u2019ve got to wait for when the conditions are right,\u201d Angel said. \u201cSo what you do in the interim, you run the company to the best of your ability every day, and you create value that way. And so if and when that time comes, you\u2019re going into that discussion from a position of strength.\u201d",
      "Thursday\u2019s report was the first since Angel took the job late last month. The railroad is under pressure from investors, such as Ancora Holdings, to find another railroad to merge with, so CSX can better compete with the merged Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern railroad if that $85 billion deal gets approved. But both of CSX\u2019s likely merger partners \u2014 BNSF and CPKC railroads \u2014 have said they aren\u2019t interested in a deal because they believe the industry can better serve customers through cooperative agreements and avoid all the potential headaches that come with a merger.",
      "Most observers believe CSX and BNSF will be at a disadvantage if the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger is approved. That transcontinental railroad will be able to shave more than a day off delivery times because it won\u2019t have to hand off shipments between railroads in the middle of the country. So far, CSX and BNSF say they can achieve most of the benefits of a merger through cooperative agreements instead.",
      "Angel, 70, has not worked at a railroad before although earlier in his career he worked at GE\u2019s locomotive building unit and developed a lifelong appreciation for railroads. He stressed the similarities between industrial gas companies and railroads, saying both focus on safety and invest heavily in the most profitable areas with the highest traffic.",

CSX completed repairs from Hurricane Helene and a major tunnel renovation in Baltimore last month. Its performance improved significantly throughout the quarter. The average speed of its trains increased to 18.9 mph, the fastest level since 2021. CSX also delivered 87% of its shipments on time in the quarter.",

      "Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024 backfired on him, triggering legislative elections that stacked the powerful lower house with opponents of the French leader but producing no outright winner.",

      "TYLER, Texas -- TYLER, Texas (AP) \u2014 Celia Monreal worries every day about the cartilage loss in her husband\u2019s knees. Not just because it's hard for her to see him in pain but also because she knows soon their health care costs could skyrocket.",
      "Monreal, 47, and her husband, Jorge, 57, rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health coverage. If Congress doesn\u2019t extend certain ACA tax credits set to expire at the end of the year, their fully subsidized plan will increase in cost, putting it out of reach. Without insurance, they won\u2019t be able to afford his expected knee replacement surgeries, much less the treatment they need for other issues, like her chronic high blood pressure and his high cholesterol.",
      "\u201cIt worries me sometimes, because if you\u2019re not healthy, then you\u2019re not here for your kids,\u201d Monreal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult decision, because, OK, do I spend $500 on a doctor\u2019s visit or do I buy groceries?\u201d",
      "Those are the types of choices facing the millions of Americans whose state or federal marketplace health insurance plans will be up for renewal in November. The enhanced premium tax credits that have made coverage more affordable for low- and middle-income enrollees for the last four years will expire this year if Congress doesn't extend them. On average, that will more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "The tax credits are at the heart of the federal government shutdown, in its third week with no end in sight. Democrats have demanded the subsidies be extended as part of any funding deal they sign, while Republicans say they'll only negotiate on the issue once the government is funded.",
      "With Congress deadlocked and the open enrollment period for ACA plans approaching on Nov. 1 in most states, Americans like Monreal are left to navigate the unknown.",
      "More than 24 million people have ACA health insurance, a group including farmers, ranchers, small business owners and other self-employed people who don\u2019t have other health insurance options through their work.",
      "The enhanced premium tax credits set to expire this year have made costs far more manageable for many of them, allowing some lower-income enrollees to get health care with no premiums and higher earners to pay no more than 8.5% of their income.",
      "If the tax credits expire, annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% \u2014 an average of $1,016 \u2014 next year, according to the KFF analysis.",
      "While some premium tax credits will remain, the level of support will decrease for most enrollees. Anyone earning more than 400% of the poverty level \u2014 or around $63,000 per year for a single person \u2014 won\u2019t be eligible for the remaining tax credits.",
      "As a result, especially hard-hit groups will include a small number of higher earners who'll have to pay a lot more without the extra subsidies and a large number of lower earners who'll have to pay a small amount more, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.",
      "With higher premiums, some people will drop out of health insurance altogether, Cox said. When many younger, healthier people inevitably forgo coverage, insurance companies will increase costs for members of the covered population to account for them being older and sicker.",
      "The change may also strain hospitals, since more uninsured people will need emergency care they can\u2019t afford. That could lead to hospital closures or cost increases.",
      "\u201cIf you have less subsidies for people getting health insurance, you\u2019re going to have less health coverage and less health care,\u201d said Jason Levitis, a senior fellow in the health policy division at the Urban Institute. \u201cPeople are going to be sicker and die more.\u201d",
      "Erin Jackson-Hill has allergies, asthma and searing hip pain she\u2019s managing with prescribed medications until she can get a hip replacement. But even with all those conditions, the 56-year-old in Anchorage, Alaska, doesn\u2019t think she can pay for health insurance next year if the ACA subsidies aren\u2019t extended.",
      "The executive director of two nonprofits, who also cares for her 89-year-old father full time, already pays nearly $500 a month for her premiums. If the subsidies disappear, she plans to forgo health insurance and pay for her asthma and allergy medications out of pocket.",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

He gathered a council of Michigan business leaders to identify skills that graduates will need for jobs, from agriculture to banking. The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",
      "Colleges are belatedly realizing how important that kind of data is to students and their families, said Lee Roberts, chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill, in an interview.",
      "\u201cIn uncertain times, students are even more focused \u2014 I would say rightly so \u2014 on what their job prospects are going to be,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think colleges and universities really owe students and their families this data.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has welcomed nearly 130 donors, allies and representatives of major companies for a dinner at the White House to reward them for their contributions to a new $250 million ballroom project",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies for a dinner at the White House to reward them for their pledged contributions to a massive new ballroom.",
      "The ballroom, whose price tag is now estimated at $250 million, is the most significant renovation that Trump, a former real estate mogul, is undertaking during his second term at the White House.",
      "All four sides of the ballroom \u2014 which Trump said will be large and grand enough to hold even a presidential inauguration -- will be made of bulletproof glass, with its color, window shape and molding keeping in character with the White House. Trump indicated that the fundraising and managing costs for the \u201cphenomenal\u201d ballroom were going well, predicting that he would have money left over after the project is done.",
      "\u201cTo me, there\u2019s nothing like the White House,\u201d Trump said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just a special place so we have to take care of it.\u201d",
      "Men in business suits and women in cocktail attire sat at a dozen round tables, decorated with tall, tapered candles and white floral arrangements, and sipped wine and water as they awaited their dinner to be served on gold-trimmed plates. Later, they would dine on an heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef Wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice cream.",
      "Among the companies that had representatives at the dinner, according to a White House official, were Amazon, Apple, Booz Allen Hamilton, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, Lockheed Martin, Meta Platforms and T-Mobile. The Adelson Family Foundation, founded by GOP megadonors Miriam Adelson and her late husband Sheldon, also had a presence there.",
      "Oil billionaire Harold Hamm, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, and crypto entrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss were all on the guest list. The list of attendees was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Also attending the dinner were Chris LaCivita, Trump's co-campaign manager from his 2024 reelection bid; Reince Priebus, a White House chief of staff during Trump's first term; and Jason Miller, another longtime political adviser.",
      "The new ballroom is planned for the area where the East Wing is located and will encompass 90,000 square feet. The White House has previously said it will have a 650-person capacity, but Trump on Wednesday night said it will be able to hold up to 999 people.",

The commission vets construction of federal buildings.",

      "At the dinner, Trump also formally unveiled another project: an arch that will stand on one end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which crosses the Potomac River and connects Virginia and the District of Columbia. He showed off several miniature models of the proposed arch \u2014 which will feature Lady Liberty on top \u2014 in three sizes, although Trump acknowledged that the largest was his favorite.",

      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The leader of Canada's most populous province called for economic retaliation on the U.S. after auto company Stellantis said it was moving planned production of its Jeep Compass from Canada to the U.S.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for the company's decision this week to shift production of the SUV from Brampton, Ontario, to Illinois as part of plan to invest $13 billion to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States.",
      "The comments come as Canada is negotiating to reduce tariffs. Trump has been urging the Big 3 American automakers to move production to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat guy, President Trump, he\u2019s a real piece of work,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of rolling over. We need to fight back.\"",

      "Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, is in Washington this week for talks to reduce tariffs on certain sectors. Carney left Washington last week without a deal.",
      "Carney said the move by the world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker was a direct consequence of tariffs and his government would work with Stellantis to create new opportunities in the Brampton area. Carney added that Ottawa expects Stellantis to fulfill its commitment to Brampton workers. The federal government threatened legal action against the company.",
      "Federal Industry Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said the production shift is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and warned Stellantis made commitments to Canadian production in exchange for substantial financial support.",
      "\"Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default under our agreements,\u201d Joly wrote in a letter to the company chief executive.",
      "Fear has spread in Ontario over what will happen to Canada's auto sector. Autos are Canada\u2019s second-largest export and Carney has noted the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday he will withhold $40 million from California because it is the only state that is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way California is enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can\u2019t demonstrate English proficiency, and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash should not have been given a commercial license because of his immigration status. The crash has become increasingly political, with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the administration\u2019s immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "\u201cCalifornia is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America\u2019s road,\u201d Duffy said.",

      "The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom quickly pushed back after the announcement Wednesday. Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for the governor, said statistics show that California commercial truck drivers have a lower crash rate than the national average.",
      "But Duffy said when he announced his concerns in August that California had conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "The Transportation Department said that to get this funding reinstated, California must adopt regulations to enforce the English rules and ensure that state inspectors are testing truck drivers' English skills during roadside inspections and pulling anyone that fails out of service.",
      "In addition to this English language issue, Duffy has threatened to pull another $160 million from California because of the way the state issues commercial drivers licenses. Duffy significantly restricted who can qualify for those licenses last month.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Dozens of reporters turned in access badges and exited the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to government-imposed restrictions on their work, pushing journalists who cover the American military further from the seat of its power. The nation's leadership called the new rules \u201ccommon sense\u201d to help regulate a \u201cvery disruptive\u201d press.",
      "News outlets were nearly unanimous in rejecting new rules imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they sought to report on information \u2014 classified or otherwise \u2014 that had not been approved by Hegseth for release.",
      "Many of the reporters waited to leave together at a 4 p.m. deadline set by the Defense Department to get out of the building. As the hour approached, boxes of documents lined a Pentagon corridor and reporters carried chairs, a copying machine, books and old photos to the parking lot from suddenly abandoned workspaces. Shortly after 4, about 40 to 50 journalists left together after handing in badges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad, but I\u2019m also really proud of the press corps that we stuck together,\u201d said Nancy Youssef, a reporter for The Atlantic who has had a desk at the Pentagon since 2007. She took a map of the Middle East out to her car.",
      "It is unclear what practical impact the new rules will have, though news organizations vowed they\u2019d continue robust coverage of the military no matter the vantage point.",
      "Images of reporters effectively demonstrating against barriers to their work are unlikely to move supporters of President Donald Trump, many of whom resent journalists and cheer his efforts to make their jobs harder. Trump has been involved in court fights against The New York Times, CBS News, ABC News, the Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press in the past year.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump backed his defense secretary\u2019s new rules. \u201cI think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe press is very dishonest.\u201d",
      "Even before issuing his new press policy, Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel host, has systematically choked off the flow of information. He\u2019s held only two formal press briefings, banned reporters from accessing many parts of the sprawling Pentagon without an escort and launched investigations into leaks to the media.",
      "He has called his new rules \u201ccommon sense\u201d and said the requirement that journalists sign a document outlining the rules means they acknowledge the new rules, not necessarily agree to them. Journalists see that as a distinction without a difference.",

      "When he served, Keane said he required new brigadier generals to take a class on the role of the media in a democracy so they wouldn\u2019t be intimidated and also see reporters as a conduit to the American public. \u201cThere were times when stories were done that made me flinch a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s usually because we had done something that wasn\u2019t as good as we should have done it.\u201d",

      "Uncrustables were invented by two friends who began producing them in 1996 in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. Smucker bought their company in 1998 and secured patents for a \u201csealed, crustless sandwich\u201d in 1999.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t easy to mass produce them. In the lawsuit, Smucker said it has spent more than $1 billion developing the Uncrustables brand over the last 20 years. Smucker spent years trying to perfect Uncrustables\u2019 stretchy bread and developing new filling flavors like chocolate and hazelnut.",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

He gathered a council of Michigan business leaders to identify skills that graduates will need for jobs, from agriculture to banking. The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",

      "A new wave of protests is unfolding worldwide, driven by young people expressing discontent with their governments",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.",
      "This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as \u201cGen Z Madagascar.\u201d",
      "The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.",
      "But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as \u201cGen Z,\u201d defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 \u2014 the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.",
      "\u201cWhat connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren\u2019t responsive to their generation\u2019s concerns, whether that\u2019s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,\u201d said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.",
      "Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.",
      "In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers\u2019 perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.",
      "The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a \u201cGen Z\u201d protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia \u2014 Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 \u2014 which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.",
      "In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar\u2019s military coup leader said he is \u201ctaking the position of president.\u201d",
      "Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called \u201cOne Piece,\u201d which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.",
      "In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.",
      "Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Mart\u00edn Square, now the stage for weekly protests.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the same battle \u2014 against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,\u201d he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte\u2019s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.",

      "\u201cDigital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we\u2019ve seen in these recent protests,\u201d said Nadel from Social Change Lab.",
      "Days before the deadly protests began in Nepal, the government announced a ban on most social media platforms for not complying with a registration deadline. Many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them and began accessing social media sites through virtual private networks to evade detection.",

      "Hold on. The rat hole wasn't what you think. It wasn't some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city's notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city's Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",

      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "The first licensed platforms are expected to start operating in late 2026 at the earliest, officials said.",
      "In granting a license, Hong Kong's transport commissioner can consider the firm\u2019s experience, financial capacity and intended investments in the region.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "They are worried that China \u2014 now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance \u2014 is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",
      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

      "Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor, also said efforts to protect U.S. research risk stifling progress if they go too far and prevent U.S. colleges or startups from sharing information about new and emerging technology. Keeping up with China will also require big investments in efforts to protect innovation, said Bellini, who recently donated $40 million to establish a new cybersecurity and AI research college at the University of South Florida.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children's access to AI chatbots.",
      "The bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn't engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly support the author's goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.",
      "Newsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.",
      "California is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.",
      "The two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.",
      "The youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate \u201chumanlike relationship\u201d with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.",

      "\u201cThis legislation is desperately needed to protect children and teens from dangerous \u2014 and even deadly \u2014 AI companion chatbots,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tech industry argued that the bill was so broad that it would stifle innovation and take away useful tools for children, such as AI tutoring systems and programs that could detect early signs of dyslexia.",

    "story": [
      "The move follows the federal indictments of James Comey and Letitia James.",
      "Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton was indicted by a grand jury Thursday on charges that he allegedly unlawfully transmitted and retained classified documents.",
      "The indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury in Maryland, charges Bolton with eight counts of unlawful transmission of national defense information as well as 10 counts of unlawful retention of national defense information.",
      "Prosecutors accuse Bolton of using a non-government personal email account and messaging application to transmit at least eight documents to unauthorized individuals that contained information classified at levels ranging from Secret to Top Secret.",
      "Seven of the transmissions allegedly occurred during the time when Bolton was serving at Trump's national security adviser in 2018 and 2019, while another document was allegedly sent by Bolton just days after President Donald Trump removed him from the administration in September of 2019.",
      "\"For four decades, I have devoted my life to America\u2019s foreign policy and national security. I would never compromise those goals,\" Bolton said in a lengthy statement, saying the indictment is part of a pattern of \"Donald Trump's retribution\" against him since leaving Trump's first administration and publishing a tell-all book.",
      "\"I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power,\" Bolton said in the statement.",
      "The move to indict Bolton comes on the heels of the indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James as President Donald Trump continues what critics call a campaign of retribution against his perceived political foes.",
      "Federal agents in August\u00a0searched Bolton's Maryland residence\u00a0and Washington, D.C., office, related to allegations that Bolton possessed classified information.",
      "Prosecutors say one document listed in the indictment \"reveals intelligence about future attack by adversarial group in another country.\" Others allegedly contain information about foreign partners sharing sensitive information with the U.S. intelligence community; intelligence related to a foreign adversary's missile launch plans; intelligence on leaders of a U.S. adversary; and one that detailed plans of covert action by the U.S. government.",
      "The indictment accuses Bolton of abusing his position as national security adviser by sharing \"more than a thousand pages\" of information in \"diary-like entries\" about his day-to-day activities with two recipients identified only as \"Individual 1\" and \"Individual 2,\" who prosecutors say are Bolton's relatives.",
      "Sources told ABC News that the relatives referred to in the indictment as 'Individual 1' and 'Individual 2' are Bolton's wife and daughter.",
      "Bolton's wife was present at their home the day the search was executed nearly two months ago.",
      "It was not immediately clear which is believed to be Individual 1 or 2.",
      "Prosecutors further allege that Bolton unlawfully retained documents, writing and notes containing national defense information ranging to levels of Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information at his home in Maryland, stored both as paper files and on a number of personal devices.",
      "The indictment says that at some point after Bolton left office as national security adviser, a cyber actor believed to be associated with Iran hacked his personal email account and gained access to the classified information he had previously emailed to his relatives.",
      "When Bolton reported the hack to U.S. authorities in July of 2021 under the Biden administration, prosecutors say he did not inform them of the allegedly sensitive national security information he shared.",

      "\"These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,\" Bolton said in the statement, referring to Trump. \"Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America\u2019s constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom.\"",
      "Bolton's attorneys have denied he ever mishandled classified information and said documents investigators found in their search of his home and residence were no longer considered classified.",
      "\"The underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago,\" Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement.\u00a0\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career -- records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021. We look forward to proving once again that Amb. Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information.\"",
      "\"There is one tier of justice for all Americans,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a DOJ statement announcing the indictment. \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\"",
      "The 10 documents the indictment says were unlawfully retained by Bolton were allegedly seized during the searches of his home and office in August, and contained similar information to the documents Bolton is alleged to have unlawfully transmitted during his time as national security adviser.",
      "The investigation is being run out of the U.S. attorney's office in Maryland, unlike the Comey and James probes which are being conducted by the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, who sources say brought the Comey and James charges against the advice of career prosecutors.",
      "Comey, who was indicted on charges of lying to Congress, and James, who is charged with mortgage fraud, have both denied wrongdoing.",
      "Last month, a federal judge unsealed a redacted version of the affidavit that had been assembled by prosecutors in order to execute their court-authorized search of Bolton's home. Most of the document concerned allegations surrounding the publication of Bolton's book, which the first Trump administration unsuccessfully sued to block.",
      "The federal judge overseeing that lawsuit expressed grave concerns over whether Bolton had included highly classified information in his book that could potentially compromise national security.",
      "On the day that Bolton's home and office were searched, Trump said that he was \"unaware\" of the searches but went on to call Bolton a \"sleazebag.\" Referencing the FBI's 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago home in his own classified documents case, Trump told reporters that having your home searched is \"not a good feeling.\"",
      "Trump\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0in June 2023 to 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House in 2021, after prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to return hundreds of documents containing classified information and took steps to thwart the government's efforts to get the documents back.",
      "After Trump was reelected president last November, the case was dropped due to a long-standing Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump, asked about Bolton in a June 2022 Oval Office interview with Fox News, said, \"He took classified information and he published it, during a presidency. It's one thing to write a book after. During. And I believe that he's a criminal, and I believe, frankly, he should go to jail for that, and that probably, possibly will happen. That's what should happen.\"",

      "Democrats are calling on President Donald Trump to get more involved with negotiations to end the government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is showing little urgency to broker a compromise that would end the government shutdown, even as Democrats insist no breakthrough is possible without his direct involvement.",
      "Three weeks in, Congress is at a standstill. The House hasn\u2019t been in session for a month, and senators left Washington on Thursday frustrated by the lack of progress. Republican leaders are refusing to negotiate until a short-term funding bill to reopen the government is passed, while Democrats say they won\u2019t agree without guarantees on extending health insurance subsidies.",
      "For now, Trump appears content to stay on the sidelines.",
      "He spent the week celebrating an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal he led, hosted a remembrance event for conservative activist Charlie Kirk and refocused attention on the Russia-Ukraine war. Meanwhile, his administration has been managing the shutdown in unconventional ways, continuing to pay the troops while laying off other federal employees.",
      "Asked Thursday whether he was willing to deploy his dealmaking background on the shutdown, Trump seemed uninterested.",
      "\u201cWell, look, I mean, all we want to do is just extend. We don\u2019t want anything, we just want to extend, live with the deal they had,\u201d he said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. Later Thursday, he criticized Democratic health care demands as \u201ccrazy,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to do it.\u201d",
      "Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Democrats must first vote to reopen the government, \u201cthen we can have serious conversations about health care.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune echoed that approach before leaving for the weekend, saying Trump is \u201cready to weigh in and sit down with the Democrats or whomever, once the government opens up.\u201d",
      "Still, frustration is starting to surface even within Trump\u2019s own party, where lawmakers acknowledge little happens in Congress without his direction.",
      "Leaving the Capitol on Thursday, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said, \u201cWe\u2019re not making much headway this week.\u201d For things to progress, Murkowski acknowledged Trump may need to get more involved: \u201cI think he\u2019s an important part of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are some folks in his administration that are kind of liking the fact that Congress really has no role right now,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t like that at all.\u201d",
      "While Congress has been paralyzed by the shutdown, Trump has moved rapidly to enact his vision of the federal government.",
      "He has called budget chief Russ Vought the \u201cgrim reaper,\u201d and Vought has taken the opportunity to withhold billions of dollars for infrastructure projects and lay off thousands of federal workers, signaling that workforce reductions could become even more drastic.",
      "At the same time, the administration has acted unilaterally to fund Trump\u2019s priorities, including paying the military this week, easing pressure on what could have been one of the main deadlines to end the shutdown.",
      "Some of these moves, particularly the layoffs and funding shifts, have been criticized as illegal and are facing court challenges. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the administration from firing workers during the shutdown, ruling that the cuts appeared politically motivated and were carried out without sufficient justification.",
      "And with Congress focused on the funding fight, lawmakers have had little time to debate other issues.",
      "In the House, Johnson has said the House won\u2019t return until Democrats approve the funding bill and has refused to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva. Democrats say the move is to prevent her from becoming the 218th signature on a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on releasing documents related to the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "So far, the shutdown has shown little impact on public opinion.",
      "An AP-NORC poll released Thursday found that 3 in 10 U.S. adults have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of the Democratic Party, similar to an AP-NORC poll from September. Four in 10 have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of the Republican Party, largely unchanged from last month.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have said Republicans have shown little seriousness in negotiating an end to the shutdown.",
      "\u201cLeader Thune has not come to me with any proposal at this point,\u201d Schumer said Thursday.",

      "This time, however, Republican leaders who control the House and Senate are resisting any push for Trump to intervene.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate when somebody\u2019s got a hostage,\u201d said South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, who added that Trump getting involved would allow Democrats to try the same tactic in future legislative fights.",
      "Trump has largely followed that guidance. After previously saying he would be open to negotiating with Democrats on health insurance subsidies, he walked it back after Republican leaders suggested he misspoke.",
      "And that's unlikely to change for now. Trump has no plans to personally intervene to broker a deal with Democrats, according to a senior White House official granted anonymity to discuss private conversations. The official added that the only stopgap funding bill that Democrats can expect is the one already on the table.",
      "\u201cThe President is happy to have a conversation about health care policy, but he will not do so while the Democrats are holding the American people hostage,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Thursday.",
      "In his second term, Trump has taken a top-down approach, leaving little in Congress to move without his approval.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s obvious to me is that Mike Johnson and John Thune don't do much without Donald Trump telling them what to do,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.",
      "His hold is particularly strong in the GOP-led House, where Speaker Mike Johnson effectivelyowes his job to Trump, and relies on his influence to power through difficult legislative fights.",
      "When Republicans have withheld votes on Trump\u2019s priorities in Congress, he\u2019s called them on the phone or summoned them to his office to directly sway them. When that doesn\u2019t work, he has vowed to unseat them in the next election. It\u2019s led many Democrats to believe the only path to an agreement runs through the White House and not through the speaker\u2019s office.",
      "Democrats also want assurances from the White House that they won't backtrack on an agreement. The White House earlier this year cut out the legislative branch entirely with a $4.9 billion cut to foreign aid in August through a legally dubious process known as a \u201cpocket rescission.\u201d And before he even took office late last year, Trump and ally Elon Musk blew up a bipartisan funding agreement that both parties had negotiated.",
      "\u201cI think we need to see ink on paper. I think we need to see legislation. I think we need to see votes,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cI don\u2019t accept pinky promises. That\u2019s not the business that I\u2019m in.\u201d",
      "Both parties also see little reason to fold under public pressure, believing they are winning the messaging battle.",
      "\u201cEverybody thinks they\u2019re winning,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cNobody is winning when everybody\u2019s losing. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now. The American public is losing.\u201d",

      "Legal experts say U.S. strikes against alleged members of Latin American drug cartels are pushing the bounds of international law",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Under President Donald Trump, the drug war is looking a lot like the war on terror.",
      "To support strikes against Latin American gangs and drug cartels, the Trump administration is relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which allowed U.S. authorities to use lethal force against al-Qaida combatants who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.",
      "The criminal groups now being targeted by U.S. strikes are a very different foe, however, spawned in the prisons of Venezuela, and fueled not by anti-Western ideology but by drug trafficking and other illicit enterprises.",
      "Trump\u2019s use of overwhelming military force to combat such groups and authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law, legal scholars say. It comes as Trump expands the military\u2019s domestic role, deploying the National Guard to U.S. cities and saying he's open to invoking the nearly 150-year-old Insurrection Act, which allows for military deployment in only exceptional instances of civil unrest.",
      "So far, the military has killed at least 27 people in five strikes on boats that the White House said were carrying drugs.",
      "The strikes \u2014 the most recent came Tuesday, in which the U.S. killed six people \u2014 have occurred without any legal investigation or a traditional declaration of war from Congress. That raises questions about the justifications for Trump's actions and the impact they could have on diplomatic relations with Latin American nations who recall with deep resentment repeated U.S. military interventions during the Cold War.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community has also disputed Trump's central claim that Maduro\u2019s administration is working with the Tren de Aragua gang and orchestrating drug trafficking and illegal immigration into the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s assertion that the United States is engaged in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels is based on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after the Sept. 11 attacks. That includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership.",
      "But the United Nations charter specifically forbids the use of force except in self-defense.",
      "\u201cYou just can\u2019t call something war to give yourself war powers,\u201d said Claire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cHowever frustrated we may be with the means and results of law enforcement efforts to combat the flow of drugs, it makes a mockery of international law to suggest we are in a noninternational armed conflict with cartels.\u201d",
      "After 9/11, it was clear that al-Qaida was actively plotting additional attacks designed to kill civilians. But the cartels' main ambition is selling dope. And that, while harmful to American security overall, is a dubious justification for invoking war powers, said Geoffrey Corn, a Texas Tech law professor who previously served as the Army\u2019s senior adviser for law-of-war issues.",
      "\u201cThis is the government, in my humble opinion, wanting to invoke war powers for a lot of reasons\" \u2014 including political ones, Corn said.",
      "\u201cEven if we assume there\u2019s an armed conflict with Tren de Aragua, how do we know everyone in that boat was an enemy fighter?\u201d he said. \u201cI think Congress needs to know that.\u201d",
      "Asked at the White House on Wednesday why the U.S. does not use the Coast Guard to stop the Venezuelan vessels and seize any drugs, Trump replied, \u201cWe have been doing that for 30 years and it has been totally ineffective.\u201d",
      "The president also suggested the U.S. may strike targets inside Venezuela, a move that would significantly escalate tensions and the legal stakes. So far, the strikes have occurred in international waters beyond the jurisdiction of any single country.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve almost totally stopped it by sea,\" Trump said of flow of drugs. \"Now we\u2019ll stop it by land.\u201d",

      "Numerous U.S. laws and executive orders since the 1970s make it illegal to assassinate foreign officials. But in declaring the Venezuelans unlawful combatants, Trump may be seeking to sidestep those restrictions and return to an earlier era in which the United States \u2014 in places like Guatemala, Chile and Iran \u2014 regularly carried out covert regime change missions.",
      "\u201cIf you pose a threat, and are making war on the U.S., you\u2019re not a protected person,\" Finkelstein said.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being \u201cone of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.\u201d",
      "But Trump's focus on Venezuela overlooks a basic fact of the drug trade: The bulk of American overdose deaths are from fentanyl, which is transported by land from Mexico. And while Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, around 75% of the cocaine produced in Colombia, the world's leader, is smuggled through the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean.",
      "Under the Constitution, it must be Congress that declares war. So far, though, there has been little indication that Trump's allies will push back on the president's expansionist view of his own power to go after cartels the White House blames for tens of thousands of American overdose deaths each year.",
      "The GOP-controlled Senate recently voted down a war powers resolution sponsored by Democrats that would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes.",
      "Despite pressure even among some Republicans for a more complete account, the Trump administration has yet to provide underlying evidence to lawmakers proving that the boats targeted by the U.S. military were carrying narcotics, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said he and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in a classified briefing this month were also denied access to the Pentagon\u2019s legal opinion about whether the strikes adhered to U.S. law.",
      "Legal pushback isn't likely to sway the White House either. A Supreme Court decision arising from an attempt in 1973 by a Democratic congresswoman to sue the Pentagon to stop the spread of the Vietnam War to neighboring Laos and Cambodia set a high bar for any legal challenge of military orders, Finkelstein said.",
      "Meanwhile, relatives of the Venezuelans killed in the boat attacks face their own obstacles following several high court rulings narrowing the scope of foreign citizens to sue in the U.S.",
      "The military strikes took place in international waters, opening the door for the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation along the lines of its war crimes probes against Russia and Israel \u2014 which, like the United States, don\u2019t recognize the court\u2019s authority.",

      "Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, is scheduled to die by pentobarbital injection at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence.",
      "He pleaded guilty to murder in the deaths of couple Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who has been in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.",
      "If the execution is carried out, it will be the fourth in the country this week and the 39th of the year.",
      "Prosecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.",
      "Authorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat and stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them. During Friday's execution, a team of four people including medical doctors and a phlebotomist will prepare syringes of saline and pentobarbital, insert an IV and inject the chemicals into Djerf. Arizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death.

      "DALLAS -- DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Two people arrested in a July shooting outside an immigration detention center in Texas are facing new charges that follow President Donald Trump\u2019s order last month to designate a decentralized movement known as antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.",
      "Autumn Hill and Zachary Evetts were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury in Fort Worth on charges that include providing material support to terrorists and attempting to murder officers and employees of the U.S. government. Federal prosecutors accuse them of being members of an antifa cell that planned the shooting.",

      "Short for \u201canti-fascists,\u201d antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.",
      "The indictment said the attack began when a group of people clad in black and wearing masks, some carrying firearms and wearing body armor, shot fireworks toward the center and vandalized vehicles and a guard shed. Then, as officers responded, one person yelled, \u201cget to the rifles\u201d and opened fire, striking an officer, according to the indictment.",
      "The indictment said that the group brought 10 firearms to the July 4 attack.",

Days after that shooting, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen near the Mexico border, injuring a police officer.

(AP) \u2014 Republican legislators offered a redrawn U.S. House district map for North Carolina on Thursday, seeking to help President Donald Trump retain GOP control of Congress by attempting to thwart the reelection of the Democrat now in the state's only swing seat.",
      "State House and Senate GOP leaders unveiled the proposed boundaries in advance of next week's General Assembly session, stepping into the national fray over mid-decade redistricting that has Democrats and Republicans battling to secure electoral advantages from coast to coast, including Texas and California. The Republicans announced earlier this week that legislators would return to Raleigh to debate and vote on a plan provided in response to Trump\u2019s call to secure more GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",

      "As anticipated, Thursday's boundaries appear, based on past election results, to focus on helping the GOP win the 1st District seat in northeastern North Carolina currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis. He won a second term in 2024 by less than 2 percentage points.",

Greene and others would be placed in a reworked 3rd District currently represented by Republican Rep. Greg Murphy, which based on election results would appear to become a little less GOP friendly.",

The Trump administration has asserted it\u2019s treating alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who must be met with military force.",
      "Frustration with the attacks has been growing on Capitol Hill. Some Republicans have been seeking more information from the White House on the legal justification and details of the strikes, while Democrats contend the strikes violate U.S. and international law.",
      "Holsey said in a statement posted on the command's Facebook page that it's \"been an honor to serve our nation, the American people and support and defend our Constitution for over 37 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe SOUTHCOM team has made lasting contributions to the defense of our nation and will continue to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that you will forge ahead, focused on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures its longevity as a beacon of freedom around the globe.\u201d",

Jeff Landry announced that he is calling state lawmakers back to the Capitol to consider changes to next year's election schedule, plans and code.",

      "GREENBELT, Md. -- GREENBELT, Md. (AP) \u2014 Former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton was charged Thursday with illegally storing and transmitting classified information.",
      "The investigation into Bolton, who served for more than a year in President Donald Trump's first administration before being fired in 2019, burst into public view in August when the FBI searched his home in Maryland and his office in Washington for classified records he may have held onto from his years in government.",
      "The 18-count indictment sets the stage for a closely watched court case centering on a longtime fixture in Republican foreign policy circles who became known for his hawkish views on American power and who after leaving Trump\u2019s first government emerged as a prominent and vocal critic of the president. Though the investigation that produced the indictment was underway during the Biden administration and began well before Trump\u2019s second term, the case will unfold against the backdrop of broader concerns that his Justice Department is being weaponized to go after his political adversaries.",
      "Agents during the August search seized multiple documents labeled \u201cclassified,\u201d \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201csecret\u201d from Bolton\u2019s office, according to previously unsealed court filings. Some of the seized records appeared to concern weapons of mass destruction, national \u201cstrategic communication\u201d and the U.S. mission to the United Nations, the filings stated.",
      "It follows separate indictments over the last month accusing former FBI Director James Comey of lying to Congress and New York Attorney General Letitia James of committing bank fraud and making a false statement, charges they both deny. Both of those cases were filed in federal court in Virginia by a prosecutor Trump hastily installed in the position after growing frustrated that investigations into high-profile enemies had not resulted in prosecution.",
      "The Bolton case, by contrast, was filed in Maryland by a U.S. attorney who before being elevated to the job had been a career prosecutor in the office.",
      "Questions about Bolton's handling of classified information date back years. He faced a lawsuit and a Justice Department investigation after leaving office related to information in a 2020 book he published, \u201cThe Room Where it Happened,\u201d that portrayed Trump as grossly uninformed about foreign policy.",
      "The Trump administration asserted that Bolton\u2019s manuscript included classified information that could harm national security if exposed. Bolton\u2019s lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.",
      "A search warrant affidavit that was previously unsealed said a National Security Council official had reviewed the book manuscript and told Bolton in 2020 that it appeared to contain \u201csignificant amounts\u201d of classified information, some at a top-secret level.",

He said that many were decades old, from Bolton\u2019s long career in the State Department, as an assistant attorney general and as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "The indictment is a dramatic moment in Bolton's long career in government. He served in the Justice Department during President Ronald Reagan's administration and was the State Department's point man on arms control during George W. Bush's presidency. Bolton was nominated by Bush to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but the strong supporter of the Iraq war was unable to win Senate confirmation and resigned after serving 17 months as a Bush recess appointment. That allowed him to hold the job on a temporary basis without Senate confirmation.",
      "In 2018, Bolton was appointed to serve as Trump's third national security adviser. But his brief tenure was characterized by disputes with the president over North Korea, Iran and Ukraine.",
      "Those rifts ultimately led to Bolton\u2019s departure, with Trump announcing on social media in September 2019 that he had accepted Bolton\u2019s resignation. Bolton subsequently criticized Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy and government in his 2020 book, including by alleging that Trump directly tied providing military aid to the country\u2019s willingness to conduct investigations into Joe Biden, who was soon to be Trump\u2019s Democratic 2020 election rival, and members of his family.",
      "Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a \u201cwashed-up guy\u201d and a \u201ccrazy\u201d warmonger who would have led the country into \u201cWorld War Six.\u201d Trump also said at the time that the book contained \u201chighly classified information\u201d and that Bolton \u201cdid not have approval\u201d for publishing it.",

      "Pushed initially by President Donald Trump, state legislators across the country are discussing and at times agreeing to change boundaries in hopes of helping members of their party and ultimately deciding control of the U.S. House in 2026. Some are finding it's not as easy as it seems.",

      "U.S. House districts are typically redrawn once a decade, immediately after a census, but some states allow it to happen more frequently. And the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal curb on political gerrymandering, in which districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party.",
      "Nebraska is among a number of states being targeted for mid-decade redrawing of congressional district lines, with the head of the National Republican Redistricting Trust last week naming Nebraska among its top candidates for change. Republican Gov. Jim Pillen said he supports the idea.",

      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall, his agent told The Associated Press.",
      "Family members said in a statement to AP that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken\" but will cherish his laughter and celebrate the kindness he bestowed upon others.",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",

Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",

    "story": [
      "Jeremy Allen White becomes \"The Boss\" in a new film, channeling Bruce Springsteen's raw vulnerability during one of the most introspective chapters of his life.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",
      "Cooper described it as more than just a biopic, saying his hope is that audiences see it as a call for compassion and connection.",
      "\"I suppose if there's anything that I want this film for people to take away from the film, it's if you're struggling, if you're despairing and if you don't know how to get help, can't afford help, ask,\" Cooper said."

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or Rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobisdashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rishiki from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rishiki competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimirate, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rishiki is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rishiki on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onasato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

In a statement shared by the festival, D'Angelo said that his doctors had advised he not perform. D'Angelo did not specify what kind of surgery he had had or what complications he was experiencing.",
      "In his statement, D'Angelo indicated that he was working on new music.",
      "D'Angelo is survived by three children: Imani, Michael and Morocco Archer. He was never married."

    "summary": "After 14 years playing NYPD detective Danny Reagan on \"Blue Bloods,\" Donnie Wahlberg now stars in the spinoff series \"Boston Blue,\" patrolling the streets of his own hometown.",
    "story": [
      "For 14 years, Donnie Wahlberg starred as Detective Danny Reagan on the CBS police procedural \"Blue Bloods.\" The hit drama about the Reagans, the fictional first family of the New York Police Department, had a loyal following. \"I was stopped on airplanes, on trains, on the street, at basketball \u2013 you name it. Wherever I was, somebody would tell me they love 'Blue Bloods,'\" said Wahlberg.",
      "Now 56, Wahlberg is sitting at a new family's dinner table, in \"Boston Blue,\" a \"Blue Bloods\" spinoff set in a city the actor knows well.",
      "Wahlberg grew up the eighth of nine kids in the working-class Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. \"We were poor,\" he said. \"There were nine kids, a dog, a cat, and a grandma in the basement, and my mom and dad for a while. There were kids coming and going, running away, being arrested. There were arguments, fights, alcohol. I definitely learned from some of my older siblings that, here's a clear path of what not to do.\"",
      "Wahlberg says he was the family peacemaker. \"I don't like to use the term ('cause I don't wanna insult my other siblings), but one of the adults. My role was to get everyone together and be happy by any means necessary.\"",
      "The discord wasn't just inside the house; 1970s Boston was a cauldron of racial tension. A controversial court-ordered desegregation program bussed students to schools outside their neighborhoods. As a first grader, Wahlberg was sent from Irish-Catholic Dorchester to predominantly Black Roxbury.",
      "He describes it as \"probably the most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"",
      "Because? \"Because I don't know what I would've not been exposed to, had I not been on those buses. In my neighborhood, if I woulda said, 'Yeah, I wanna be a singer one day,' I could think of five kids in the neighborhood who would punch me in the face. And two of them lived in my house!\"",
      "It was after hearing hip hop in the fourth grade that Wahlberg caught the performing bug. \"I would listen to 'Rapper's Delight,' I just would start writing my own raps and making up my own songs,\" he said.",
      "That helped Wahlberg earn an audition, at just 14 years old, with Maurice Starr, the local impresario who'd founded New Edition and was starting a new band. \"Maurice was looking for the equivalent of the Osmonds to the Jacksons,\" he said.",
      "What did his parents think? \"My mom was super supportive,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'Dad, I'm gonna start this music band.' And he said, 'Well, I tell ya' what: If you ever do make it big, and you come home, and you've changed, I'm gonna kick your ass.'\"",
      "In 1984, Donnie and his younger brother Mark became the first two members of New Kids on the Block. But the family affair was short-lived, as Mark quit. \"He didn't like singing,\" said Donnie. \"He couldn't sing.\u00a0 There's a scene of him as Dirk Diggler in 'Boogie Nights' singing horribly. That's actually better than he sang as a member of New Kids!\"",
      "With four other members in place (including some of Wahlberg's schoolmates), the group struggled at first to find its footing. But by the late 1980s, they appeared to have the right stuff:",
      "While the band was popular, it was far from critics' choice. \"I really struggled with the criticism of the band \u2013 we couldn't sing, we were puppets, we were fake,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "To feel better about himself, Wahlberg focused on writing and producing, not just for the New Kids, but also for his brother Mark. Soon enough they had a #1 hit, \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "Donnie said, \"Marky Mark and my brother's career and his music was really when I started to get my head screwed on right of how I could really prove myself.\"",
      "Prove himself \u2026 and protect his kid brother. \"My brother was getting in trouble and my mom was like, 'You gotta help your brother and get him out of the streets,'\" said Wahlberg. \"I don't like to wear the Marky Mark and my brother's career as some kind of badge of honor. He worked very hard for his career. But I really did, you know, help him in a big way, and helped myself in a big way in doing that.\"",
      "After the New Kids broke up in 1994, Wahlberg turned to acting, breaking through in \"The Sixth Sense.\" Other roles followed, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Boomtown,\" along with reunions for New Kids on the Block, which still keep him busy.",
      "Wahlberg now lives outside Chicago, in a home he shares with his second wife, TV personality Jenny McCarthy.",
      "\"We have very similar upbringings, which really helps,\" said McCarthy. \"I think we're both people-pleasers, which could also be bad if you're not in therapy about it!\"",
      "\"Lotta therapy we've each had, and together,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "\"But we're caretakers, you know, of our family, which I think is something to be proud of,\" McCarthy added.",
      "They may now live in McCarthy's hometown, but Boston is never far from Wahlberg's heart, as evident in his home office, which features mementoes from Bill Belichick, Bill Russell and Larry Bird.",
      "And then there's his new show which he wasn't sure he wanted to do after \"Blue Bloods\"' cancellation. \"I love 'Blue Bloods,'\" he said. \"I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it on the air. And here's an opportunity to keep this character alive. And suddenly, when I started to look at it through that lens, it was like, how do I not do this? If all those millions of 'Blue Bloods' fans don't show up and love it, then I know we put our best foot forward.\"",
      "Between his TV work and concerts, it's a busy life for Donnie Wahlberg. \"People say to me, 'Oh, gosh, when do you sleep?' You want me to complain? Everything I ever wanted, I'm doing it. I wanna work harder, I want to be worthy of it. I want to be worthy of \u2026 the gift that so many people give me of their time. How can I not work my ass off to repay that?\"",
      "But he says he's just doing what he's always done: \"My childhood was spent trying to bring joy and love to a large group of people amidst chaos and confusion and pain. And it's what I do for a living right now.\u00a0 It's what I've grown up to do.\"",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Bear\" talks about how he approached playing legendary rocker Bruce Springsteen in a new film, and what he found in common with him.",
    "story": [
      "Asbury Park is a Jersey beach town with heart, history and harmony, not to mention a voice. Bruce Springsteen's presence can still be felt in his old haunts \u2013 the Stone Pony, the Wonder Bar, Madam Marie's. The town's welcome mat is its storied boardwalk, where we met Jeremy Allen White. \"There's a lot of romance here still, I feel like,\" said White, who was thinking about his own hometown.",
      "\"Do you feel that way a little bit about Brooklyn?\" I asked.",
      "\"I do, yeah. I always feel at home there.\"",
      "Had that Brooklyn boy come out here, say, three years ago, he might have been just another tourist. But not anymore. His turn as the talented but tormented chef on the award-winning FX series \"The Bear\" has made the 34-year-old one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood.",
      "I said, \"Early on, it strikes me that if you were just to read the script, it was kind of just a story about a sandwich shop.\"",
      "\"It was a hard thing to explain,\" said White, \"and it sounded something like that, you know? Yes, this, like, kid, he comes back, he's a chef, and he's, like, opening a sandwich shop. And I saw my friends trying to be nice and say, Oh, that sounds great, you know?\"",
      "He ended up sweeping nearly all of the awards: Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice. His two young daughters call them his \"trophy winners cups.\" \"They like them, they get a kick out of it, but they also are very honest and there's just like, Why do you get all these things?\" White said.",
      "Back out at the Jersey shore, it's not those past awards that matter. It's the ones that might be coming down the Jersey Turnpike for White's performance as Springsteen himself.",
      "And yes, that really is White's voice. He said, \"If you're gonna do one thing to get it right, you have to perform to the point of exhaustion. 'Cause he continues until he cannot go any longer.",
      "\"Everybody's got their own idea of Bruce Springsteen. And I think at the beginning, I was approaching it like, how am I going to make everybody happy? That's a fool's errand. It's an impossibility.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment that you thought to yourself, Yeah, I got this. I can do this?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" White replied. \"There were moments where I found confidence, but I always wanted more, I wanted more time, I wanted to go deeper.\"",
      "Springsteen was aware of White before the film. He had seen and admired the emotional complexity in his work, and that's a well Springsteen knew whoever played him needed to have. White said, \"Bruce has gone on record and said, you know, I have no problem performing for three hours on stage. That's easy for me. I know exactly who I am on stage. You know, it's the other 21 hours that I have trouble with.\"",
      "\"Did you know any of that before you really took a deep dive?\" I asked.",
      "\"I mean, I was familiar enough with his music that, you know, I understood his depth, and I understood, you know, we're dealing with a man who's looked over the edge before, absolutely,\" said White. \"But, no.\"",
      "The film, \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" based on the book of the same name, follows the making of the 1982 album \"Nebraska.\" Some say it's Springsteen as his best, but he himself may have actually been at his worst.",
      "In his 2016 autobiography, \"Born to Run,\" he describes an emotional breakdown while at a Texas county fair, not long after \"Nebraska\" was finished:",
      "\"I've just pulled a perfect swan dive into my abyss; my stomach is on rinse cycle, and I'm going down, down, down. I just feel a need to get rooted somewhere, before I drift into ether.\"",
      "White said, \"I asked him, what's that panic about? You know, what is that fear inside of you? And he said, 'I had this moment where I felt like an outsider and observer in my own life.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Have you ever struggled with mental illness yourself?\"",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" said White. \"When he told me about that, that feeling of being an observer of your own life, that was very familiar to me. I remember when I found acting, there was a lot of like, I think like, chaos and confusion, just a lot going on. I couldn't focus on myself. And I found acting, and I found some peace and I found some focus.\"",
      "White has drawn from that emotional trough as early as he can remember, even during his days of doing crime dramas on TV, when he was looking for certain things \u2013 not just a job. \"Yeah, you know, I was very lucky, I was a kid, so my first agents were kind of confused and upset with me for kind of, like, having a standard for what I would go audition for,\" he said. \"I'd never done anything before when I was 13, and they were like, Just go on the audition, you know?\"",
      "One of those auditions landed him on \"Shameless.\" For 11 seasons he played bad boy, big brother, and brainiac Lip Gallagher.",
      "His unruly hair and blue eyes got him counted among the so-called \"rodent men\" - a term used to describe a few of the most physically desirable things a man can be these days. His Calvin Klein underwear ad certainly helped.",
      "Before we left the shore, we stopped by the Stone Pony, where White tried to re-create on film Springsteen's early glory days.",
      "\"Bruce was there, like he was a lot of days, and he came out, and he kind of introduced me to the audience, so he gave them to me all warmed up,\" White recalled. \"They made me feel like a star for three-and-a-half minutes. And then the first A.D. would say 'Cut,' and they would go silent. And I remembered, I am not Bruce Springsteen, I am just an actor!\"",
      "A guy from Brooklyn playing a guy from Jersey \u2013 they both seem to understand one another, and neither would change a thing.",
      "White said, \"The ride is fun, but I'm, you know, I'm filled up. I just want to work with people I admire and be able to keep doing what I love to do. That's what's important to me.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, if all the fame and success ended after this film, you'd feel like ...?\"",
      "\"Can I still work?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"Then, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\"",

    "summary": "The owners and operators of independent cinemas are working to adapt as audience habits change.",
    "story": [
      "Audiences have been enjoying films at movie theaters for decades, but streaming and expensive\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0have impacted\u00a0moviegoing habits. For the owners and operators of independent theaters, survival means getting creative.",
      "Kevin Smith, the man behind cult classics like \"Clerks\" and \"Mallrats,\" bought a theater in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2022. It was the cinema he'd gone to growing up. He renamed it Smodcastle Cinemas, and hoped that even as it reeled from COVID-19 shutdowns, he could rekindle the magic he'd loved as a child.",
      "\"I learned more about myself sitting in this (theater) than I ever did sitting in a classroom or sitting in church or something like that, and it led me to the rest of my life,\" Smith said.",
      "But the reality of operating the movie theater was difficult, even for a celebrity like Smith. They operate as a non-profit, Smith said, because if they functioned as a for-profit business, they \"would die.\" Smith can bring in celebrity guests for Q&A sessions and other events. The theater also hosts an annual film festival.",
      "\"Saving my childhood theater with my friends? Dream come true, worst financial investment I ever made in my life,\" Smith said.",
      "On the opposite coast, film store Vidiots has been bringing new movies to audiences for 40 years. When it opened in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, in 1985, it operated as a traditional video store with an extensive and rare collection of films. In 2023, Vidiots moved to Eagle Rock and expanded into an exhibition space, reviving the historic Eagle Theater.",
      "\"We opened to uncertainty,\" said executive director Maggie MacKay. \"We had no idea if people would come, and they did. And they've been coming ever since.\"",
      "MacKay said Vidiots has become a touchstone for local kids.",
      "\"One of the biggest surprises and the happiest surprises for us and the thing that I think I most wanted to happen here is that young people come here,\" she said. \"Teens, tweens are getting dropped off by their parents. And because this place is affordable and welcoming and nonjudgmental and safe, they are coming here all the time. We've got kids growing up here who call the video store their video store. We have a kid who calls it 'my video store.' That kid has no idea that that is a very unique thing to say in the 2020s.\"",
      "Like Smodcastle, Vidiots operates as a non-profit. That isn't the only path to success for these kinds of theaters, though, as New York City's Metrograph proves. The two-screen theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side shows international and arthouse fare and operates as a for-profit. Business is booming, CEO Christian Grass said, with the theater recently enjoying its best summer on record.",
      "\"People love going to the movies and people love the experience,\" Grass said. The theater also has a bookstore, a magazine, a streaming service, an extravagant concession stand and a swanky bar and restaurant. The establishment has focused on building a sense of community, said Metrograph director of programming Inge de Leeuw, which ensures people keep coming back. MacKay said she's also found people are looking for connection, community and a place they can go.",
      "\"Everybody wants movies in their lives, whether they know it or realize it or not,\" MacKay said. \"To save this thing, you have to make available every point of access for it. You have to make a return to a social experience.\"",
      "While independent theaters are taking different paths to success, they have one thing in common: They want to keep introducing new and classic films to audiences.",
      "\"You want to learn something about somebody, sit in the darkness and watch movies with them,\" Smith said. \"You will learn a lot about a person. You'll find out if they're empathetic. You'll find out what makes them laugh. You'll find out if there's a real human being there, if there's a heart underneath that all, man.\""

    "summary": "A recent report found high levels of lead in some protein powders and shakes, but demand among U.S. consumers has soared.",
    "story": [
      "The demand for protein has soared as 61% of consumers in the U.S. increased their protein intake last year, according to new research from Minnesota-based food corporation Cargill. And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.",
      "\"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals \u2013 they're all encouraging more protein after lifting,\" said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.",
      "The protein boom",
      "Protein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, according to Mintel, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights reported, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.",
      "Chains like Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that \"consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",
      "Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.",
      "\"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly,\" Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition, said.",
      "Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.",
      "But \"today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need,\" Byrne said.",
      "Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.",
      "Consumer Reports recently found some protein powders and shakes contain high levels of lead. A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their investigation, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.",
      "\"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary,\" Tieu said. \"Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement.\"",
      "For some people \u2014 including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes \u2014 protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.",
      "\"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily,\" she said.",
      "How much protein is really needed in a diet?",
      "For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.",
      "Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein \u2014 this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.",
      "\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"",
      "Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.",
      "\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.",
      "High-protein foods",
      "\"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis,\" Tieu suggests.",
      "Some protein-rich foods include:",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A scientist laid off by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said \"the everyday American should be very concerned\" by reductions in force amid the government shutdown.",
      "The scientist, one of hundreds of CDC employees terminated by the Trump administration last week, asked that her identity be concealed for fear of retribution.",
      "\"It's going to mean more deaths, more preventable deaths,\" she told CBS News on Wednesday of the layoffs. \"People will absolutely die from the impact of this administration.\"",
      "The scientist worked at the CDC for the past decade, studying chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "She spoke out the same day a federal judge in Northern California issued a verbal order temporarily halting all the government layoffs that were issued since the shutdown began. This was in response to a lawsuit brought by federal employees' unions.",
      "\"They went in and fired entire programs, even statutorily mandated by law programs, they cut entirely,\" she said. \"So there is no staff to do this work anymore.\"",
      "She said everything she was working on has come to a complete stop.",
      "\"It's truly like an episode of 'Squid Games,' because we don't know what's going to happen next,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has used the government shutdown, now in its third week, to lay off more than 4,000 federal workers, and plans to go further, according to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said Wednesday during an appearance on \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"",
      "Since last week, the Trump administration has informed approximately 600 CDC employees they have been laid off.",
      "On Tuesday, internal CDC officials not authorized to speak to the media told CBS News that on Oct. 10, about 1,000 CDC employees were initially given reduction-in-force notices, a government term for layoffs.",
      "However, within about 24 hours, hundreds of those notices were rescinded, reducing the total number of layoffs in the agency since Oct. 10 to about 600, the officials said.",
      "The judge's ruling Wednesday would put the layoffs of those 600 employees on hold, leaving them in limbo while the case plays out.",
      "According to numbers provided by a congressional source familiar with the cuts, the 600 CDC layoffs impacted all staff in the CDC's offices in Washington, D.C., all staff for the office of the director for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, all staff for the National Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Infrastructure and Workforce, and all policy and communications staff for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.",
      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. A vaccine skeptic, Kennedy controversially replaced all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "And in August, less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate as CDC director, Susan Monarez was fired from her post over what she said was pressure from Kennedy to rubber-stamp his vaccine directives, later testifying before the Senate that Kennedy's demands were \"inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official.\" Her firing also prompted several top CDC officials to resign in protest.",
      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",
      "\"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "But the scientist who spoke to CBS News said the turmoil inside the CDC will impact responses to disease outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in South Carolina, where five new cases were reported Tuesday, bringing the total to 16 since July, and forcing 139 students into quarantine, according to health officials.",
      "\"The surge capacity of the CDC is going to be significantly hampered with these cuts,\" the scientist told CBS News. \"It's going to impede our ability to respond to public health outbreaks, just when all of these threats are on the rise.\""

      "Americans receive tens of millions of unsolicited automated calls and texts each day, often intended to dupe them into forking over personal information or money.",
      "That's the thrust of a new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization, which found that scam and telemarketing calls and texts have proliferated across the country, despite safeguards intended to prevent them. (Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In 2018, the FDA finally began testing talcum powder and other related products for asbestos. A year later, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew a batch of its powder after the FDA found asbestos fibers in a sample.",
      "The U.K. claims will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury, at the U.K. High Court's Manchester Circuit Commercial Court.",
      "In a statement, Kenvue said it believes the judge will find that its talc-based powder did not cause cancer.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the attribution of the statement from Kenvue Ltd. to BBC News and to note that it is a separate company from J&J, not a subsidiary."

    "summary": "A new scam involves fake letters that appear to be from U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts \u2014 but it's a ploy to trick seniors, agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "It looks official \u2014 a letter stamped with the U.S. Supreme Court seal, signed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, warning that you're under investigation. But it's a scam \u2014 one designed to steal money from Social Security recipients, according to the agency's watchdog division.",
      "The fake SCOTUS letter prompted an Oct. 8 warning from the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General, cautioning the program's 75 million beneficiaries to be on alert if they receive a purported letter from the nation's highest court.",
      "While the warning didn't disclose how many Social Security recipients have been targeted by the fraud, the watchdog group said the hoax marks the evolution of government imposter scams, such as the decade-old scheme in which criminals\u00a0pretend to be IRS officials\u00a0informing their target victims that they're under investigation for tax fraud. The threat of an IRS probe has long been used by scammers to scare individuals into providing money or private data such as Social Security numbers.",
      "In this latest version of the same scheme, fraudsters are impersonating Supreme Court justices, rather than IRS officials. The new scam relies on multiple points of contact, with a fake letter followed by a text or call from the fraudsters, making it appear more authentic, said John Haraburda, Transaction Network Services (TNS) robocall data expert and director of product management.",
      "\"The fraudsters get very, very smart,\" Haraburda said. \"They do the mailing, then they'll send you a text from the number they're going to use for the phone call saying, 'This is the Social Security Administration \u2014 we're going to be calling you from this number in a few seconds.'\"",
      "He added, \"Then you've got this text message in a way authenticating the call that's coming in. That lets you break down your hesitation, to basically drop your guard.\"",
      "According to the Social Security Inspector General, the scam letter is personally addressed to the would-be victim, warning that they're a suspect in connection with legal proceedings and criminal charges. It also falsely claims their Social Security number has been compromised.",
      "The fake letter goes on to say that the Supreme Court has requested financial institutions to freeze the recipient's assets, and urges them to cooperate with \"the U.S. Treasury Department,\" the watchdog agency said.",
      "\"The letter ominously closes by stating, should the recipient encounter any difficulties in safeguarding assets, the recipient will bear full liability for any losses incurred following the suspension of their SSN,\" the SSA's inspector general said. \"Scammers most likely will follow up with text messages or telephone calls.\"",
      "Scammers may follow up with a text that includes a link to a fake Social Security site, which will capture the victim's login and password as they attempt to gain access to their accounts, or might ask for credit card info, Haraburda said.",
      "Never click on a link in an email or text that purports to be from an official, he noted. Instead, go directly to the Social Security site \u2014 https://www.ssa.gov \u2014 to log in.",
      "\"On every level, this letter is completely false,\" Michelle L. Anderson, acting inspector general at the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General said in a statement. \"These criminals are falsely accusing an individual of a crime and using federal agencies and federal officials to try to scare and legitimize their scam \u2014 if you get this type of letter, rip it up and report it.\""

      "Other forecasts show broader spending is expected to hold up this holiday season, a critical period for retailers. Consumers plan to spend an average of roughly $890 each on holiday gifts, food, decorations and other seasonal items, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "Although that's a dip from the nearly $902 people spent last year, it still represents the second-highest figure since the trade group started tracking holiday spending more than two decades ago."

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",

      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",

      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",
      "\"We slow it down\"",
      "On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addressed potential safety concerns during the shutdown on Fox Business News. \"We want to make sure that when you travel you travel safely, and so if we don't have controllers necessary to keep you safe, we slow it down,\" he told the network.",
      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",
      "Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing major airlines, last week sought to reassure the public that flying during the shutdown is safe, while acknowledging that control tower staffing shortages could lead to delays.",
      "\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" the group said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience.\""

    "summary": "States are battling for their piece of $50 billion in federal rural health funding, but it's not just hospitals vying for the money. Tech startups and policy demands are raising the stakes as Medicaid cuts loom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Nationwide, states are racing to win their share of a new $50 billion rural health fund. But helping rural hospitals, as originally envisioned, is quickly becoming a quaint idea.",
      "Rather, states should submit applications that \"rebuild and reshape\" how health care is delivered in rural communities, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services official Abe Sutton said late last month during a daylong meeting at D.C.'s Watergate Hotel. Simply changing the way government pays hospitals has been tried and has failed, Sutton told the audience of more than 40 governors' office staffers and state health agency leaders \u2014 some from as far away as Hawaii.",
      "\"This isn't a backfill of operating budgets,\" said Sutton, CMS' innovation director. \"We've been really clear on that.\"",
      "Rural hospitals and clinics nationwide face a looming financial catastrophe, with President Trump's massive tax-and-spending law expected to slash federal Medicaid spending on health care in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years. Congressional Republicans added the one-time, five-year Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to win the support of conservative holdouts who worried about the bill's financial fallout for rural hospitals.",
      "Yet, the words used by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz and his agency's leaders to describe the new pot of cash are generating tension between legacy hospital and clinic providers and new technology-focused companies stepping in to offer new ways to deliver health care.",
      "It's \"what I would call incumbents versus insurgents in the rural space,\" said Kody Kinsley, a senior policy adviser at the Institute for Policy Solutions at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.",
      "Applications are due Nov. 5. The money will be awarded to states by the end of the year and distributed over five years.",
      "Half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application; the other half will go to states that win points. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on a formula that calculates each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "The application identifies specific policy goals such as implementing the Presidential Fitness Test and restrictions to food assistance, as well as broader investment strategies around remote care services, data infrastructure, and consumer-facing technology tools, which CMS identified as \"symptom checkers and AI chatbots.\"",
      "In September, after CMS officials released the application, Republican members of Congress from states with Democratic governors called for fairness, concerned their states might direct the money to urban areas. In a letter to Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they said the money \"will serve as a lifeline for rural and at-risk hospitals in our communities that are already struggling to keep their doors open.\"",
      "Smaller hospitals fear they will get \"a tiny little slice\" of each state's share, said Emily Felder, who leads the health care practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law firm whose clients include rural hospital systems.",
      "\"There's a lot of frustration,\" Felder said.",
      "But Kinsley, who was previously North Carolina's secretary of health and human services, said using this money only to shore up a balance sheet \"is really just throwing good money after bad.\" In contrast, he said, insurgents such as technology-driven startups can offer new strategies.",
      "One of those companies vying for funding is Homeward Health, a Silicon Valley-based company that contracts with Medicare managed care insurers. Using artificial intelligence analytics, Homeward helps patients get care in their home and with local providers.",
      "The company manages the health of 100,000 rural Michigan patients enrolled in insurance, said Homeward co-founder and chief executive Jennifer Schneider. The company was a sponsor for the Watergate summit. It also has ongoing meetings with Oz and his team, Schneider said.",
      "\"They're doing their job, and they're talking to a lot of people in the ecosystem and really eager to learn from those of us that have been in the system,\" Schneider said. \"We're one of many in that position.\"",
      "KFF Health News requested an interview with Alina Czekai, director of the newly created Office of Rural Health Transformation. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said the agency was \"unable to accommodate facilitation of any interview.\"",
      "Instead, CMS provided an emailed statement from Oz saying the program \"will help states and communities reimagine what's possible for rural healthcare.\"",
      "Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, the largest organization representing rural hospitals and clinics, said the money would best be used to help pay for transformation that isn't \"sexy\" or \"revolutionary.\"",
      "\"If what we end up with is we have a wearable for every rural patient, I don't think that's transformational,\" Slabach said, referring to digital health monitors such as fitness-tracking watches.",
      "Slabach, a onetime small-hospital chief executive and an unofficial adviser to hundreds of rural facilities nationwide, named a few ideas for the money \u2014 including paying for capital improvements such as electronic health records or equipment, loan repayment programs to aid workforce development, and creating \"SWAT\" teams that rescue rural hospitals on the brink of closure.",
      "More than 150 rural hospitals have closed nationwide since 2010 \u2014 a statistic cited by CMS' Sutton that is well known among industry watchers. The Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, which compiles the closure data, also released a guide to help states calculate how rural they are for their applications.",
      "State applications will be reviewed by a panel, with some reviewers from within the government but others outside it, said Kate Sapra, acting deputy director of the Office of Rural Health Transformation, speaking at the Watergate.",
      "\"We will train them in the scoring criteria,\" Sapra said, adding that the panelists will not be coming from \"your state\" and will need to fill out conflict-of-interest forms. A portion of money each state gets will be reevaluated annually based on the progress it makes on its goals and priorities, according to CMS.",
      "States are creating stakeholder groups, asking for public comment, and working with their health agencies. Some, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, are hiring consultants.",
      "In Montana, a collection of health providers and associations proposed a list of ideas for the cash, including creating a loan repayment fund for rural clinicians to try to ease worker shortages.",
      "\"It's one-time money, and it's a little bit of money,\" said David Mark, a doctor who is the CEO of One Health, which has clinics dotted across eastern Montana and Wyoming. A state could receive a minimum of $100 million a year for five years if all 50 states have applications approved.",
      "\"How do you accomplish goals of a health care system transformation with an infusion of money like that?\" Mark said.",
      "Neither Montana nor Wyoming \u2014 vast, rural states \u2014 sent leaders to the Watergate summit, according to a copy of the attendees list. In the afternoon, attendees could rotate among planning tables and meet with corporate sponsors such as the electronic health records behemoth Epic and the emergency services company Global Medical Response.",
      "Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs confirmed his state did not send representatives to the event, because they were \"stretched with other commitments.\" Montana, Wyoming, and other states submitted an optional letter of intent signaling they will apply for the funds. CMS did not respond to questions about how many and which states have submitted letters.",
      "During the Watergate event, hints of brewing competition among states began to surface.",
      "\"I think Arkansas' application is going to be better than yours,\" seasoned political adviser Jack Sisson said with a smile during a morning panel.",
      "The audience laughed. Sisson, who recently left his job as health adviser for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, had interrupted Michael Hendrix, policy adviser to another Republican governor, Tennessee's Bill Lee.",
      "\"See, this is the kind of friendly competition that CMS is hoping for,\" Hendrix said. He grinned, thanked Sisson, and added, \"I look forward to us both winning.\"",
      "KFF Health News Montana correspondent Katheryn Houghton contributed to this report.",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism."

      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",

      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:10:23 -0400",
    "summary": "A new lawsuit alleges Bank of America profited from its dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Bank of America was sued Wednesday over its alleged financial ties with Jeffrey Epstein, with the lawsuit claiming the financial giant facilitated and also benefited from his alleged sex trafficking venture.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of a Jane Doe, alleges Epstein committed his crimes \"through access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including Bank of America.\" Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "\"Egregiously, Bank of America had a plethora of information regarding Epstein's sex trafficking operation but chose profit over protecting the victims,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Bank of America said it has no immediate comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit comes after Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, opened an investigation into four large banks, including Bank of America, over their business relationship with Epstein. The probe is seeking more information about roughly $1.5 billion in financial transactions handled by the banks on behalf of Epstein.",
      "Suspicious activity?",
      "Jane Doe was living in Russia when she met Epstein in 2011, and was sexually abused and trafficked by him until 2019, the lawsuit alleges. It claims Epstein relied on force, threats, fraud and coercion to control her.",
      "In 2013, Epstein's accountant instructed her to open a Bank of America account, where money could be wired, purportedly to generate records for U.S. immigration authorities and to cover her rent, according to the lawsuit. The banking transactions should have raised red flags with the bank, the complaint alleges.",
      "\"A review of Jane Doe's account history will show incredibly alarming and erratic banking behavior, as Epstein, through one of his loyal employees, would utilize Jane Doe's account, often without her knowledge, to conduct business in amounts that were not typical for Jane Doe, and that would have in fact been impossible based on Jane Doe's income or typical pattern of deposit,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Banks are required by law to report suspicious activity in customer accounts to federal authorities in order to flag potential criminal activity, such as money laundering or fraud. The complaint alleges that Bank of America failed to file suspicious activity reports, known as SARs, until after Epstein's death in 2019.",
      "According to the New York Times, Bank of America\u00a0filed two SARs in 2020 related to $170 million in payments made to Epstein by billionaire investor Leon Black. The timing of the SARs was questioned by Raskin in an October 2025 letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "\"These SARs not only were untimely \u2014 filed years after the transactions in question \u2014 but Bank of America processed the payments without asking for information as to the nature of the transactions,\" Raskin wrote. \"Financial institutions are often the first line of defense in detecting serious federal crimes, especially the ones that involve significant flows of money like sex trafficking.\"",
      "He added, \"Flagging and detecting Mr. Epstein's suspicious withdrawals may well have stopped his crimes years earlier.\"",
      "The Oct. 15 lawsuit claims that \"Bank of America's failure to timely file SARs about Epstein's sex-trafficking venture, in spite of numerous red flags, was wrongful and purposeful.\"",
      "The complaint also alleges that Epstein would not have been able to expand his illegal operations \"without complicit financial banking institutions that would ignore red flags and assist him in his sex-trafficking scheme.\"",
      "JPMorgan's settlement",
      "In exchange for looking the other way, the suit alleges, Bank of America profited by earning \"interest, commissions, service fees, and other financial benefits directly from its connection with Epstein, Epstein-related entities, and others acting in concert with Epstein.\"",
      "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase reached a\u00a0$290 million settlement with Epstein's victims over allegations the bank overlooked his crimes because of the profits it earned from him. At the time of the settlement, JPMorgan said it regretted its association with Epstein and that it \"would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes.\"",
      "The lawsuit against Bank of America is seeking class-action status on behalf of other women abused by Epstein. The attorney representing Jane Doe is David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, who represented Epstein's victims in the settlement with JPMorgan."

      "That's consistent with expectations from major airlines.",
      "United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby in September said 2025 was shaping up to be a busy holiday travel season.",
      "\"The entire fourth quarter, the fall break, Thanksgiving, Christmas, they're all likely to set records with strong demand,\" Kirby told CBS News last month. \"At the beginning of July, it was like a light switch got flipped on and demand started to come back.\"",
      "Kirby noted that Thanksgiving and Christmas reservations have \"further accelerated\" demand for flights, which he sees as a strong indicator that the economy is in good shape.",
      "Delta Air Lines is also \"expecting the holidays to be great,\" CEO Ed Bastian said on the company's third quarter earnings call last week.",
      "Cirium analyzed data from online travel agencies and other sources. The analysis tracks with airlines' perception of consumer demand, too.",
      "Airlines have added nearly half a million more seats for the Thanksgiving travel period compared with last year to accommodate what it anticipates will be an uptick in demand for flights.",

    "story": [
      "America's population of seniors is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years \u2014 a shift that could spark a crisis of aging, as most people remain unprepared for longer lives, according to new research from the MIT AgeLab and insurance company John Hancock.",
      "Americans are lagging in readiness to handle the demands of greater longevity, ranging from managing the cost of a longer retirement to maintaining their health in old age, according to the inaugural Longevity Preparedness Index, or LPI, from the MIT AgeLab, a research institute focusing on improving the quality of life for older people, and John Hancock.",
      "The problem goes well beyond saving for retirement \u2014 another area where Americans are known to fall short \u2014 and touches nearly every aspect of aging, from building community in later life to preparing for care when people can no longer look after themselves. Some people may fail to plan simply because they underestimate their own longevity, with\u00a0earlier research by Stanford University retirement expert Annamaria Lusardi finding that Americans generally believe they'll die younger than statistics predict.",
      "\"Believe it or not, longevity is quite new \u2014 we've always had older people, but never this many older people living this long,\" Joe Coughlin, founder and director of the MIT AgeLab, told CBS News. \"We can't look to our parents, saying 'This is how they did it.'\"",
      "Preparing for a long old age isn't all about money, although that remains an important part of retirement readiness, said Brooks Tingle, CEO of John Hancock, told CBS. While Americans are living longer, they're spending more years in poorer health, which raises additional issues around preparing for longer retirements than prior generations, he noted.",
      "A 65-year-old woman has a 40% chance of living to age 90, while men the same age have a 30% chance of reaching that age, according to Lusardi's research.",
      "The study analyzed eight aspects of longevity preparedness:",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.\u00a0Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.\u00a0Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.\u00a0Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.\u00a0Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.\u00a0Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.",
      "Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.",
      "Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.",
      "Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.",
      "Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.",
      "Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.",
      "Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.",
      "Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "U.S. adults scored an average of 60 out of 100 across the eight areas, which MIT and John Hancock said signifies that Americans' general longevity preparedness is low.",
      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

The scammers then stole the funds, laundered them and used the proceeds for luxury travel, entertainment and other extravagant purchases, according to the agency.",
      "Allegations of human trafficking",
      "Federal prosecutors said Prince Group targeted victims around the world with assistance from local networks, including one operated from Brooklyn, New York. To carry out the schemes, the criminal actors allegedly trafficked hundreds of people and forced them to work in a network of compounds across Cambodia. The \"violent, forced labor camps\" consisted of vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, according to the Justice Department.",
      "To dodge law enforcement, Chen and Prince Group's top executives allegedly paid bribes to public officials and used their political influence, the department said.",

      "\"Cambodia is the physical location where a lot of it operates, but it's also the money laundering center for the entire region,\" Taylor said",

      "The Trump administration's tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the full impact of those policies may not be felt for some time. While the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it's too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the organization said.",
      "Economists have warned that the furniture, wood and related houseware levies would likely hike costs for consumers building or remodeling a home. Recent inflation data showed that prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025, driven by country-based U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",
      "Furniture and bedding prices rose 4.7% over the same period, while the cost of household furnishings and supplies climbed 2.8%."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:59:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Citing the shutdown, the Social Security Administration postponed its announcement of the annual payment bump beneficiaries will receive in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",
      "Social Security had planned to announce the new COLA on Oct. 15, the same day the Labor Department was scheduled to release September Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation. The COLA is determined by inflation figures for the third quarter, which covers July through September.",
      "With much of the government's economic data on hold until Congress approves federal funding, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now plans to release its latest CPI figures on Oct. 24, about nine days later than planned. The Social Security Administration told CBS News it plans to issue its COLA announcement that same day.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",
      "According to an estimate published last month by the Senior Citizens League, the annual COLA for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025.",
      "The League, an advocacy group for older Americans, based its most recent projection on\u00a0August inflation data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the SSA will also include September inflation data in its COLA rate, that number could change when it's announced later this month.",
      "AARP, another advocacy group for older people, expects the 2026 COLA to range from 2.6% to 2.9%. A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062.",
      "Where is inflation now?",
      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",
      "Some retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continues to climb and their 2026 Social Security adjustment fails to keep pace with inflation. The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

      "The J.M. Smucker Company, the brand that makes peanut butter and jelly spreads, is suing Trader Joe's over what it says is a copycat version of its Uncrustables sandwiches.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Ohio on Monday, accuses the popular grocery chain of trademark infringement for selling pre-made peanut butter and jelly\u00a0sandwiches\u00a0that closely mimic the company's Uncrustables' packaging and crustless sandwich design.",
      "Smucker's calls the Trader Joe's product an \"obvious attempt to trade off of the fame and recognition of the Uncrustables Design Marks.\" The lawsuit also alleges that the supposed copycat version of the product has \"deceived\" consumers into thinking the Trader Joe's product is in some way sponsored by or affiliated with Smucker's.",
      "\"Our focus is solely on protecting the unique trademarked design that represents the high quality associated with the Uncrustables brand and preventing consumer confusion caused by imitation,\" Smucker's said in a statement to CBS news.",
      "Trader Joe's did not respond to request for comment.",
      "A crustless copycat?",
      "Smuckers' Uncrustables, designed for lunchbox convenience, is a round pocket of white bread with crimped edges. Inside are different fillings such as chocolate-flavored hazelnut spread and strawberry jam or grape jelly with peanut butter. The company has marketed the sandwiches as quick-and-easy kids' lunch options for parents on the go, requiring no prep, just time to thaw outside of the freezer before consumption.",
      "In its court filing, Smucker's said it's been using the round pie-like shape to represent the product since 1996 and an image of the sandwich with a bite taken out of it since 2000. Uncrustables are sold in thousands of retail stores across the country and are on track to becoming a $1 billion brand, according to the complaint.",
      "The Trader Joe's product accused of being an Uncrustables knockoff is described on packaging as \"crustless peanut butter & strawberry jam sandwiches.\" The round pocket-sized sandwiches come in a bright blue box with a stack of the sandwiches depicted on the front, with a small bite taken out of the top sandwich, revealing the filling.",
      "Smucker's alleges that Trader Joe's packaging closely mimics that of the Uncrustables, by prominently featuring the same color blue Smucker's uses in its own branding. On Smucker's packaging, the word \"Uncrustables\" appears in a blue font, the lawsuit notes.",
      "Smucker's alleges Trader Joe's decision to use a similar design will deceive and cause confusion among customers. It will also claims that \"irreparable injury\" will be caused to the Smucker's brand unless the court takes action to limit Trader Joe's \"wrongful acts\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "Smucker's has requested in its complaint that Trader Joe's stop using branding its says imitates that of the \"Uncrustables Design Marks.\" It calls on Trader Joe's to deliver the affected products \u2014 including containers, labels, packaging and more \u2014 for destruction. It also asks the grocery chain to pay Smucker's \"gains, profits, and advantages Defendant has obtained\" as a result of the alleged trademark infringement, as well as legal fees."

    "published": "Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Many IRS workers are furloughed due to the government shutdown, but taxpayers are still required to file their extensions this week.",
    "story": [
      "Although the U.S. government remains closed, taxpayers who requested a filing extension from the IRS earlier this year remain on the hook to submit their income tax returns by Oct. 15.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit and pay federal income taxes as they normally would,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS News. \"The lapse in appropriations does not change federal income tax responsibilities.\"",
      "In a typical year, about 20 million Americans \u2014 about 13% of all taxpayers \u2014 ask the IRS for a tax filing extension, according to agency data. Extensions, which are provided automatically if a taxpayer requests more time, provide an additional six months to prepare and file federal returns.",
      "An extension can help taxpayers who are facing complex tax situations or who need extra time to get their documents prepared for filing. Even so, an extension doesn't get exempt you from paying taxes you owe to the IRS, as the tax agency expects taxpayers to make good on their debts by the regular April 15 deadline.",
      "Most IRS operations are closed during the government shutdown. About half of the agency's workers have been on furlough since Oct. 8, with essential employees continuing to work in areas such as taxpayer services and submission processing, according to Baker Tilly, a tax advisory company.",
      "When is the tax extension deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes if you've received an extension is 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 15, in your local time zone, which means taxpayers should submit their electronic filing before that time on Wednesday.",
      "Can you get an extension past Oct. 15?",
      "Generally, no, according to the IRS.",
      "However, the agency this year has given some state residents more time beyond Oct. 15 to file their federal returns due to natural disasters in their regions.",
      "For instance, all residents of both\u00a0Arkansas\u00a0and\u00a0Tennessee\u00a0qualify for an extension because of April storms, flooding and tornadoes. Taxpayers in those states have until Nov. 3 to file their federal returns. Kentucky residents and people living in some West Virginia counties also have until Nov. 3 due to February storms that caused severe damage in those areas.",
      "What are the penalties for missing the filing deadline?",
      "If you miss the Oct. 15 filing date to file your tax return, the IRS will charge 5% of the amount due for each month or part of the month that it is late, up to a maximum of 25%.",
      "But the IRS says\u00a0that it might waive the penalty \"if you have a reasonable explanation for filing late,\" and asks taxpayers to attach an explanation for the late filing with their tax return.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 20:29:00 -0400",
    "summary": "DealBook founder and Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin takes a look at the crash of 1929 in his new book. He tells 60 Minutes what may it may indicate about today's stock market.",
    "story": [
      "After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression.",
      "Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming.",
      "\"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep,\" he said. \"But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash.\"",
      "The Roaring '20s",
      "Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History \u2013 and How It Shattered a Nation,\" out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s.",
      "Market highs today have him feeling anxious.",
      "\"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced,\" he said.",
      "The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker.",
      "Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.",
      "\"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,\" Sorkin said. \"And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way.\"",
      "Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump\u00a0 threatened more China tariffs.",
      "\"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort,\" Sorkin said. \"The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?\"",
      "Protecting consumers in the market",
      "When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.",
      "Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and \"the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore.\"",
      "\"That's what concerns me,\" Sorkin said. \"It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off.\"",
      "Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.",
      "In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.",
      "\"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that,\" Sorkin said. \"But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that.\"",
      "Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.",
      "But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people.",
      "\"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich,\" Sorkin said.",
      "Push today for democratizing investing",
      "In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers.",
      "Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained.",
      "The new investment opportunity comes with risk.",
      "\"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight,\" Fink said.",
      "Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.",
      "\"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,\" he said. \"There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold \u2014 that is, it's an alternative.\"",
      "He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.",
      "But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink.",
      "\"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it,\" Sorkin said.",
      "The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day.",
      "\"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day,\" Sorkin said."

      "\"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani responded. \"What you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\"",
      "Mamdani attacked Cuomo, describing him as an old-school politician who will only give New Yorkers more of the same and insinuating that Cuomo is in some way tied to the president.",
      "The only time the two agreed was when they were asked who the best mayor of New York City was. Both said Fiorello LaGuardia, who served in the post from 1934-1945.",

      "And a CBS News poll last month had Mamdani leading, with an especially wide gap among those whose top issue is the cost of living.",
      "At one point, Mamdani said, \"It's been an hour and 20 minutes of this debate, and we haven't heard Governor Cuomo say the word 'affordability.' That's why he lost the (Democratic) primary.\"",
      "And time and time again, the focus seemed to go back to antisemitism and whether Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state.",
      "\"The assemblyman still won't say he believes that Israel has the right to existence as a Jewish state. He is a divisive personality,\" Cuomo charged.",
      "Mandami, who is Muslim, pushed back.",

      "Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones squared off in their first and only debate Thursday over a set of violent and incendiary text messages sent by Jones \u2014 an issue that has overtaken the race and vaulted it to national prominence.",
      "Miyares, an incumbent running for reelection, pushed hard against Jones for the leaked texts, which included messages to a Republican delegate in which Jones said that former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get \"two bullets to the head.\"",
      "Referencing a quote from President Abraham Lincoln, Miyares started the debate by saying: \"Character is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he (Jones) was doing in the dark.\"",
      "Jones apologized for his words from the start.",
      "\"Let me be very clear,\" he said. \"I am ashamed, I am embarrassed and I'm sorry.\"",
      "Still, the Democrat rebuffed Miyares by noting that violent rhetoric can be heard on both sides of the aisle, and that President Trump has been known to use extreme language at times.",
      "\"What about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?\" Jones said, adding, \"You haven't said a word. I've taken accountability for my mistakes. It's time you take accountability, too.\"",
      "The race for Virginia attorney general has emerged as one of the most competitive statewide contests in this year's election, with members of both parties taking an interest in the down-ballot race.",
      "While Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has faced setbacks in her race for governor, as has John Reid, the GOP lieutenant governor nominee, the attorney general's race remains fiercely competitive. Last week, it spilled over into the governor's race when former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, refused to say during a debate whether she still supported Jones' candidacy, suggesting it was up to the voters to decide.",
      "Jones and Miyares tangled over the violent text message for much of the debate.

Miyares also hit Jones over a reported\u00a02022 reckless driving conviction.",
      "\"Jay, if you were to apply to be a line prosecutor ... you would not pass a background check,\" Miyares said.",
      "Asked by a moderator how voters can trust him, Jones acknowledged that he \"made very great mistakes\" but was held accountable for them.",
      "Jones, in turn, spent much of his time arguing that Miyares lacked the nerve to sue the White House if the Trump administration overreached, saying Miyares \"won't hold the president accountable.\"",
      "\"Jason hangs out with Donald Trump at MAGA rallies,\" Jones said. \"I will see Jason Miyares and Donald Trump in court as your next attorney general.\"",
      "The candidates tackled other legal matters likely to involve the attorney general's office, including the enforcement of Virginia's clean energy law and the scope of Virginia's Human Rights Act, a state law prohibiting discrimination.",
      "Miyares and Jones also exchanged jabs on which candidate would do a better job of keeping Virginians safe. Miyares argued that Jones lacked the experience to hold criminals to account, citing a story by The Richmond Times-Dispatch of a Virginia state trooper clocking Jones speeding 116 miles per hour, leading to a reckless driving conviction.",
      "Jones, for his part, touted his record serving as a delegate in the Virginia House, where he said he supported legislation cracking down on sex offenders and human trafficking. He also referenced his experience going after ghost gun manufacturers while working in the attorney general's office for the District of Columbia.",
      "At one point, a moderator from the Virginia State Bar asked the candidates how they viewed the attorney general's office \u2014 as a political or legal one.",
      "\"It's clearly a legal one, and that's exactly why we have to hold the president accountable, go after Donald Trump and the bad actions of this administration,\" Jones eagerly responded.",
      "Miyares side-stepped the question, saying it's an office there to protect Virginians.",
      "\"Jay Jones wants fights in Washington,\" he said. \"He's running for the wrong office.\""

      "The head of the U.S. military's Southern Command will retire later this year, a high-profile departure that comes as the Trump administration strikes alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean and puts pressure on the Venezuelan government.",
      "Adm. Alvin Holsey announced his retirement from the U.S. Navy in a statement posted to social media on Thursday. He said he is retiring after 37 years in the Navy in mid-December \u2014 just over a year after he was first promoted to lead Southern Command, or SOUTHCOM.",
      "\"I am confident that you will forge ahead, focused on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures its longevity as a beacon of freedom around the globe,\" Holsey wrote.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth thanked Holsey for his service, and said his time at SOUTHCOM \"reflects a legacy of operational excellence and strategic vision.\"",
      "SOUTHCOM's area of responsibility includes much of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean Sea. It's an increasingly active territory as the Trump administration deploys naval warships, fighter jets and thousands of troops to the Caribbean as part of an anti-drug trafficking mission.",
      "Since last month, the military has carried out six known boat strikes. The most recent took place on Thursday, and unlike in other strikes that were announced by President Trump, some of the passengers survived, a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "The administration has argued the strikes are justified as part of a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. But some members of Congress have questioned the administration's legal justification and pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "The attacks have also contributed to increased tensions with Venezuela, as the U.S. accuses the country's President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with cartels. Maduro has denied the allegations and condemned the boat strikes, alleging Mr. Trump is seeking to foment regime change.",
      "The U.S. military flew three B-52 bombers within 150 miles of Venezuela on Wednesday. And in two separate incidents last month, Venezuela flew military aircraft near U.S. naval vessels in what Defense Department officials described to CBS News as a \"game of chicken.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Wednesday he is also weighing strikes on land-based drug traffickers, and he confirmed that he has authorized covert CIA action in Venezuela.",
      "As the situation in the region intensifies, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Holsey's departure \"troubling.\"",
      "\"At a moment when U.S. forces are building up across the Caribbean and tensions with Venezuela are at a boiling point, the departure of our top military commander in the region sends an alarming signal of instability within the chain of command,\" the Rhode Island senator said in a statement."

    "story": [
      "President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton was indicted in Maryland on Thursday for allegedly mishandling classified information by sharing diary entries about his time in the White House with family members.",
      "Bolton is the third prominent Trump critic to be indicted in recent weeks, following charges against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress and New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. All three have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Bolton indictment, Mr. Trump said he was not aware of it, but said: \"I think he's a bad guy.\"",
      "In a statement, Bolton said he has \"become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department,\" and argued that Mr. Trump \"embodies what Joseph Stalin's head of secret police once said, 'You show me the man, and I'll show you the crime.'\"",
      "\"I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power,\" Bolton wrote.",
      "Bolton was charged in the 26-page indictment with 18 criminal counts, including eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining national defense information.",
      "The indictment alleges he \"abused his position as National Security Advisor by sharing more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities\" with two unnamed relatives, including material that had a top secret classification.",
      "It says he sent \"diary-like entries\" to the two people using a nongovernmental email, \"such as email accounts hosted by AOL and Google.\" Those entries allegedly included classified information up to the top secret and sensitive compartmented information level, a designation that means it was derived from sensitive intelligence sources.",
      "Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, denied that Bolton illegally shared or retained information.",
      "\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career \u2013 records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said in a statement Thursday. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries \u2013 that is not a crime.\"",
      "At some point between 2019 and 2021, the indictment says, Bolton's email account was hacked by a \"cyber actor\" believed to be linked to Iran. It alleges that Bolton told federal officials about the hack but didn't say that his account had been used to send classified information, or that he had shared this material with two relatives.",
      "The charges say Bolton received a haunting email about the hack in 2021, warning, \"I do not think you would be interested in the FBI being aware of the leaked content of John's email\" and calling it \"the biggest scandal since Hillary's emails were leaked.\"",
      "Bolton is also accused in the indictment of printing out some of the documents with national defense information and storing them at his home in Montgomery County, Maryland. Prosecutors allege some of this information was also saved and stored on personal electronic devices used by Bolton and others in his personal residence.",
      "The indictment says printouts of the diary entries \u2014 and electronic files showing he sent the messages \u2014 were found in Bolton's home and office during an FBI search in August. According to unsealed court papers, agents found records marked classified during the searches.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement after the indictment was handed down: \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\"",
      "What information is Bolton accused of mishandling?",
      "The diary entries allegedly included \"detailed information that BOLTON learned from meetings with senior members of the U.S. Government, intelligence briefings from members of the intelligence community and military, discussions with foreign leaders and foreign intelligence and military organizations, and intelligence products and reports.\"",
      "The indictment outlines the types of information Bolton is accused of unlawfully retaining and sharing. It includes intelligence on attacks by an adversarial group in another country, intelligence that a foreign government was planning a missile launch in the future, covert actions planned by the U.S. and intelligence about what foreign governments knew about a planned attack against the U.S.",
      "In some cases, the indictment says, Bolton and his relatives traded observations about the diary entries. \"Stuff coming to cheer you... up!!!\" Bolton allegedly wrote in one message affixed to a 20-page document.",
      "Bolton has faced years of scrutiny over classified info",
      "Mr. Trump has had a rocky relationship with Bolton since he left his post as national security adviser in 2019 amid disagreements over Middle East policy. At the time, Bolton said he offered his resignation, but Mr. Trump said he asked Bolton to resign.",
      "Bolton then wrote a book about his tenure \u2014 \"The Room Where It Happened\" \u2014 that portrayed the president in an unflattering light. Mr. Trump claimed that Bolton \"illegally released much Classified Information\" in his book, calling him \"a lowlife who should be in jail.\"",
      "None of the classified information that led to Thursday's charges was published in the book, the indictment says.",
      "The first Trump administration tried to stop the publication of the book and later sued him for the profits, arguing it contained classified information. The Justice Department opened a criminal inquiry into whether Bolton had published classified information, claiming he had failed to complete a prepublication review \u2014 which Bolton has denied.",
      "In a late September event at the Harvard Kennedy School, Bolton said, \"I'm very confident that there's nothing in the book that's classified. That's why there was a prepublication review.\"",
      "In June 2020, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth denied the Justice Department's effort to stop the publication of Bolton's book, but after reviewing the classified materials at issue, said in his ruling that Bolton \"likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.\"",
      "\"Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States,\" Lamberth wrote. \"He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability.\"",
      "DOJ charges a third Trump foe",
      "The charges against Bolton came after a different prosecutor's office \u2014 the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia \u2014 brought criminal charges against Comey and James, who have also drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years. They have denied all wrongdoing and argued the charges against them are driven by politics.",
      "The Trump administration has lashed out at Bolton in the past. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's second inauguration, his administration removed Bolton's Secret Service protection. Bolton had been granted the protection by the Biden administration in December 2021, after a series of threats from Iran that were linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure. That strike resulted in the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.",
      "The charges against Bolton also follow investigations into Mr. Trump and former President Joe Biden after classified documents were allegedly found in their homes.",
      "In Mr. Trump's case, the Justice Department brought criminal charges in 2023 accusing the then-former president of mishandling sensitive documents and conspiring to obstruct justice. The charges were later dismissed after a federal judge found a Justice Department special counsel had been unlawfully appointed.",
      "And in Biden's case, a special counsel found he \"willfully\" retained classified documents, but decided no criminal charges were warranted."

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday continued to block President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops within the Chicago area amid ongoing immigration protests, but allowed the service members to remain under federal control.",
      "The three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit said in a unanimous decision that \"the facts do not justify\" Mr. Trump's actions in Illinois under the section of federal law known as\u00a0Title 10, which the president has invoked to federalize National Guard troops to protect federal immigration personnel and government facilities in several cities.",
      "Over the weekend, the 7th Circuit issued a preliminary order that temporarily\u00a0blocked the deployment of Guard troops within Illinois, but allowed them to remain under federal control. Its decision Thursday maintains that posture, with the panel explaining its reasoning in an 18-page decision.",
      "\"At this stage, we cannot say the administration is likely to succeed in demonstrating that the President lawfully federalized the Guard under\" provisions of Title 10, the 7th Circuit panel wrote. It consisted of Judges Ilana Diamond Rovner, David Hamilton and Amy St. Eve. Rovner was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush, Hamilton was tapped by former President Barack Obama and St. Eve was nominated by Mr. Trump.",

      "\"Federal facilities, including the processing facility in Broadview, have remained open despite regular demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies,\" the judges said. \"And though federal officers have encountered sporadic disruptions, they have been quickly contained by local, state, and federal authorities.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump says his administration will \"dramatically slash the cost of IVF\" by negotiating lower drug prices, though the move falls short of his pledge to have IVF fully covered by insurance or the government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the cost of drugs for in vitro fertilization will decrease \"dramatically,\" as his administration has negotiated lower prices for an expensive component of the IVF cycle.",
      "IVF cycles can cost $25,000 or even more, as Mr. Trump said, and many couples need multiple cycles. Most employers don't offer fertility insurance coverage.",
      "\"As a result of these actions, the per-cycle cost of drugs used in IVF will fall by an estimated 73% for American consumers, and the numbers are going to actually be very substantially higher as time goes by when it really kicks in,\" Mr. Trump announced in the Oval Office.",
      "\"A major reason for these high prices is the excessive cost of the drugs involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The number one fertility drug used in IVF is currently 700% more expensive in the United States than the rest of the world.\"",
      "The president said biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono has agreed to provide \"massive discounts\" to all fertility drugs they sell in the U.S., including Gonal-f, a critical drug in the shot protocol required for egg stimulation. EMD Serono said in a statement\u00a0that patients will be able to buy its fertility drugs directly at an 84% discount from list prices.",
      "\"We're here today to announce a historic victory for American women, mothers and families,\" Mr. Trump said. \"With the actions I will outline this afternoon, we'll dramatically slash the cost of IVF and the treatment and many of the most common fertility drugs for countless millions of Americans.\"",
      "The president also said his administration is working to make it easier for companies to offer supplemental insurance coverage for fertility. Some companies do already offer supplemental fertility coverage.",
      "While significant, the president's move falls short of his pledge in August 2024 to have IVF covered fully by either insurance or the federal government. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in February directing the White House to look at how to expand IVF access, although the recommendations from those efforts have never been released.",
      "It's not yet clear how much the lower drug costs will decrease the overall cost of an IVF cycle. Women require varying volumes of the stimulation drugs.",
      "Slashing drug prices by more than half doesn't mean the cost of an IVF cycle will decrease that much. The drugs are an expensive part of the procedure, but the cost also includes ultrasounds, anesthesia and other fees. Each cycle costs between $12,000 and $25,000, and many couples undergo several cycles. Very few states require insurance companies to provide coverage for the treatment, so the vast majority of women and couples must pay out of pocket for IVF rounds. For couples who choose to keep frozen embryos, there is also a monthly or annual storage fee, which can cost more than $1,000 a year.",
      "Taxpayers won't be subsidizing fertility coverage, a senior administration official told reporters on a phone call ahead of the president's announcement, on the condition of anonymity. While the Trump administration is encouraging employers to offer fertility coverage, there will be no requirement for employers to do so, the official said. The Department of Labor, Treasury Department and Department of Health and Human Services will be issuing guidance allowing fertility benefits to be offered as accepted benefits outside of major medical insurance plans. Senior administration officials told reporters it's hard to diminish the cost of the drugs because they require careful storage and refrigeration. They also said there are other drugs involved in an IVF cycle that have not yet been negotiated that could further reduce costs.",
      "During the campaign, the president called himself the \"father of IVF\" and a \"leader on fertilization, IVF.\"",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,\" Mr. Trump, then a candidate, said in August 2024. He added, \"We're going to be paying for that treatment, or we're gonna be mandating that the insurance company pay.\""

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday he plans to move ahead with a bill to impose sanctions on Russia that has overwhelming bipartisan support, saying the \"time has come.\"",
      "\"I think we need to move,\" the South Dakota Republican said at the Capitol, shortly after President Trump shared that he was on a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Mr. Trump said after the call that he and Putin agreed to meet in Budapest, Hungary, in the near future. The call with Putin came a day before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to visit the White House.",
      "Thune said he did not want to commit to a hard deadline on the Senate taking up the sanctions bill, but told reporters it would be \"soon.\" When asked to define \"soon,\" he added, \"next 30 days.\"",
      "The House remains out of session during the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, indicated that a vote may not yet have his blessing, telling reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon that \"it may not be perfect timing.\"",
      "Senators have been pushing for months for a vote on the legislation that would impose fresh economic sanctions to dial up the pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine. It gained momentum in late May and early June as Mr. Trump\u00a0appeared increasingly frustrated with Putin after Russia escalated attacks against Ukraine amid stalled peace negotiations.",
      "But the U.S. involvement in the war between Israel and Iran put the measure on the backburner in late June as it appeared to be nearing a vote. The White House also wanted changes to the measure to give the president more flexibility in imposing the sanctions.",
      "The sanctions bill was put on hold again when Mr. Trump threatened on July 14 to impose tariffs on countries that do business with Russia if it did not agree to a ceasefire.",
      "It received renewed interest in September when Russian drones entered Poland's airspace during an attack on Ukraine, weeks after Mr. Trump met with Putin in Alaska. But lawmakers held off on a vote because it had not received the green light from Mr. Trump, which lawmakers say they were waiting for to move ahead.",
      "The bill was introduced by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in April and has the support of 84 other senators, all but guaranteeing its passage in the Senate. A companion bill in the House has the support of more than 100 members.",
      "Thune said Thursday he has met with Graham about the bill and lawmakers have been trying to address technical issues, including how the bill would be implemented \u2014 details that had concerned the White House.",
      "\"I think the time is right,\" Thune said. \"I'm hoping we can get it scheduled.\"",
      "Thune said Graham will be filing an updated version of the bill, but did not detail how it would be different from the current version. Thune added that it would be \"the same basic premise.\"",
      "The measure includes a 500% tariff on imported goods from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and uranium. Senators previously said it was modified to allow the president to waive the sanctions for national security reasons.",
      "\"It's not unbridled or unconstrained authority simply to waive the sanctions,\" Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a cosponsor of the bill, said earlier this year. Blumenthal described the sanctions as \"scorching\" and \"bone-crushing.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has also backed sanctions, saying that Putin has been unwilling to talk seriously about ending its war.",
      "\"I think we have to send him a message,\" Johnson said this summer."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, citing what he describes as \"lawless\" enforcement tactics during recent federal crackdowns.",
      "The resolution, cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Jonathan Jackson and Jasmine Crockett, urges the Department of Homeland Security to require ICE and CBP personnel to wear body cameras, display visible identification and stop wearing facial coverings except in cases of immediate safety threats. It also calls for transferring oversight of ICE to the Justice Department and creating independent civilian review boards to investigate enforcement actions.",
      "\"This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,\" Khanna told CBS News. \"We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.\"",
      "The resolution, set to be introduced Friday, is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled lower chamber, where Republicans have strongly backed the Trump administration's immigrant enforcement operations and resisted new restrictions on federal agents. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer included roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion for ICE.",
      "Khanna's proposal follows weeks of heightened tension over Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration initiative that has led to more than 1,500 arrests across Illinois and neighboring states. Immigration operations have drawn scrutiny after reports of masked agents, unmarked vehicles and violent encounters involving civilians and journalists.",
      "On Tuesday, federal agents deployed tear gas during an attempted arrest on Chicago's Southeast Side, prompting clashes with residents and local police. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration officers operating in the area to wear body cameras, saying she was \"a little startled\" after seeing reports of tear gas and force used against protesters. \"I live in Chicago,\" Ellis said. \"And I'm not blind.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson defended federal immigration officers earlier this week, saying he has \"not seen them cross the line yet.\" Johnson told reporters that \"ICE and the valiant, brave, patriotic Americans who step up to serve in these dangerous law enforcement positions deserve our respect and our support,\" adding that Republicans \"stand for law enforcement.\"",
      "Khanna's resolution references recent incidents in Chicago and similar tactics in Los Angeles and New York, warning that the use of masks and unmarked vehicles \"fuels impersonation of immigration officers\" and undermines public trust. He said he hopes to build a coalition that includes libertarian-leaning Republicans and members of the Freedom Caucus who \"understand the importance of not having government overreach.\"",
      "On Thursday, DHS defended its officers, saying federal agents have faced escalating assaults. \"CBP Officers and Agents are facing a barrage of assaults including incidents involving thrown rocks, bricks, and other dangerous objects that can cause serious injury to law enforcement personnel or members of the public,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. She added that officers \"are authorized to defend themselves and others\" and that DHS \"reviews all uses of force thoroughly and takes its legal and operational responsibilities seriously.\"",
      "The department has said assaults against ICE agents have risen more than 1,000% this year, though it has not released data supporting that figure.",
      "Khanna said his resolution aims to restore public confidence while ensuring officer safety.",
      "\"I unequivocally condemn the threats and violence against ICE agents,\" he said. \"They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats. This will make sure that Americans' constitutional rights are protected and the constitutional rights of immigrants are protected.\""

      "This was the fifth such strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean. Figures released by the administration say 27 people have been killed in the strikes.",
      "The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service said it was \"aware of the reports\" that citizens of the country, which lies less than 10 miles off the coast Venezuela, had been on the vessel. Police said they are conducting inquiries, but said that the information \"is yet to be fully verified through official channels\" and said they could not confirm any details. The agency said a statement would be released once information was verified, and asked for \"patience and understanding\" amid \"this complex situation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Democrats blocked an effort to advance an individual year-long appropriations bill to fund the Pentagon on Thursday, stalling Republican leaders' alternative approach to restart some funding on Day 16 of the\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In a 50 to 44 vote, all but three Democrats voted against moving forward with the full-year Defense Department appropriations bill. Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania voted in favor of advancing the bill. It needed 60 votes to advance.",
      "The vote came as the Senate remained locked in a stalemate, with no movement despite repeated votes on a short-term funding measure to reopen the government. The push to move forward with the Pentagon funding bill marked a change in approach as the shutdown wore on.",
      "Since 60 votes are required to advance most legislation in the Senate, Republicans need support from across the aisle to reopen the government. And with 53 Republicans in the Senate, Democratic support was also needed to advance the full-year Pentagon funding bill. Democrats have continued to demand an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits in exchange for their support.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune railed against Democrats on the Senate floor after the vote fell short, saying\u2028Democrats \"just voted against the bill that would actually pay the troops.\"",
      "\"This is politics,\" Thune said. \"If anything was needed to demonstrate just how fundamentally uninterested Democrats are in supporting our troops and defending our country, just take a look at this vote.\"",
      "The South Dakota Republican said \"the Democrat Party is the party that will not take yes for an answer,\" citing the repeated failed vote on a temporary measure to fund the government, his assertions that he would guarantee a vote on Democrats' health care demands and the failed effort to advance the Pentagon funding bill.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated ahead of the vote Thursday that Democrats would oppose advancing the legislation. The New York Democrat told reporters at a news conference that \"it's always been unacceptable to Democrats to do the Defense bill without other bills that have so many things that are important to the American people, in terms of health care, in terms of housing, in terms of safety.\"",
      "Although Democrats have been at odds with Republicans over how to keep the government funded in the short term, they have generally been supportive of work on the regular appropriations process. But Schumer argued that \"we have always negotiated these appropriations agreements in a bipartisan way,\" and Republicans are now \"just going at it alone.\"",
      "Each year, Congress must pass legislation to fund the government. But the process has often stretched late into the fiscal year, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap measures to keep the government funded while they continue work on the 12 full-year appropriations bills. In recent years, Congress has resorted to grouping the funding measures together into large packages, known as omnibus bills. Those are often considered at the last minute before a deadline, pressuring lawmakers to support them and fund the government. Still, GOP leadership in Congress has been pushing to return to the way the appropriations process is intended to play out, with individual funding bills.",
      "Thune encouraged Democrats earlier Thursday to allow the full-year Pentagon funding bill to advance, telling reporters that if Democrats \"want to stop the Defense bill, I don't think it's very good optics for them.\"",
      "\"They've got multiple opportunities to block it on the back end,\" Thune said. \"If I were them, I'd let us get on it, and then let's see if we can add.\"",
      "Thune said lawmakers wanted to add appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, noting that a couple of other appropriations bills are available to wrap into a funding package as well. But doing so would require unanimous consent after a vote on advancing the measure. Schumer said \"they don't have it\" ahead of the vote.",
      "The Pentagon legislation would restore paychecks for members of the military. It comes as President Trump directed the department to \"use all available funds\" to avoid service members missing their mid-month paychecks on Oct. 15. Still, the move hasn't taken pressure off of lawmakers to reach a permanent solution, with Speaker Mike Johnson calling the administration's maneuver a \"temporary fix.\""

      "Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency in charge of the legal immigration system, said the vetting effort primarily relies on what he called the \"social media screening\" of people applying for green cards and other immigration applications.",
      "In August, the Trump administration issued a directive instructing USCIS officials to consider the identification of \"anti-American\" views and activity of certain applicants for immigration benefits as an \"overwhelmingly negative factor\" that could justify denial.",
      "Asked what types of views and activities could be found to be \"anti-American\" by his agency, Edlow cited \"what we've seen college campuses to have allowed over the last several years.\"",
      "\"There has been such a large-scale espousing of foreign terrorist ideology, whether it's Hamas or another organization that has been matched with \u2026 a clear desire by these elements to trample on the rights of other people around them,\" Edlow told CBS News during an interview at USCIS headquarters in Maryland.",
      "Pressed on whether those determinations could be based on speech protected by the U.S. Constitution, Edlow said, \"Absolutely not.\"",
      "\"People are free to make whatever statements they want on social media or anywhere else. And anyone who, you know, doesn't support the same candidate that I support. That is not what we're talking about,\" he said.",
      "\"We are talking about beyond the pale,\" Edlow added. \"We are talking about people who are actively supporting the violent overthrow of this country, or otherwise are providing material support to terrorist organizations across the world.\"",
      "Edlow said the probe into \"anti-American\" views and activities would not be the sole criteria for granting or denying applications.",
      "\"It's not the deciding factor. It's not the only factor, but it is one factor that we want to make sure that we fully understand,\" he said.",
      "Critics of the Trump administration have accused it of weaponizing U.S. immigration law to punish noncitizens for their legally protected speech.",
      "Federal courts have questioned the legality of the administration's effort to deport legal residents like Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who participated in protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza. The administration has claimed Khalil and other activists undermined U.S. foreign policy and fostered antisemitism. But those targeted and their allies have argued the government is simply penalizing them for exercising their First Amendment rights.",

      "\"I don't want to be the DMV\"",
      "Unlike its sister agencies Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, processing immigration benefits has long been the core function of USCIS.",
      "But under the second Trump administration, USCIS has placed a greater emphasis on combating immigration fraud, aggressively vetting applicants and working more closely with ICE, including to facilitate arrests at its offices across the country. This summer, the agency also announced it would hire and train its own team of armed special agents, who Edlow said are not yet on the job.",
      "The citizenship process alone has been tweaked several times by the Trump administration, which has added more questions to the civics test used to quiz applicants on U.S. history and politics, and expanded inquiries into whether applicants have \"good moral character.\"",
      "It has also restarted a long-dormant practice, known as \"neighborhood checks,\" which involves sending investigators to interview the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants. Edlow said those checks will not apply to every case due to resource constraints.",
      "Immigrant advocates argue the changes are unfairly scaring legal immigrants. But Edlow said USCIS is \"moving back to where it was supposed to be at the beginning,\" arguing that it had effectively become \"a rubber-stamping agency\" under the Biden administration. He said vetting has always been a core function of USCIS since its creation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",
      "\"We are not here as a police force,\" he said. \"We are going to be here with our agents investigating large scale fraud patterns that right now create much confusion and many problems within the legal immigration system.\"",
      "Edlow argued the effort would ultimately make it easier for people to immigrate to the U.S. legally.",
      "\"I don't want to be the DMV \u2026 of this government,\" Edlow added. \"We want to be faster. We want to be leaner.\"",
      "No decision yet on DACA's future",
      "One of the most well-known programs administered by USCIS is the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which currently protects half a million so-called \"Dreamers\" from deportation and allows them to work in the U.S. legally. They are immigrants who, as children, entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas.",
      "The first Trump administration tried to terminate DACA, arguing it was illegal. But the Supreme Court blocked the effort on technical grounds.",
      "Asked whether the second Trump administration will try to end DACA again, Edlow suggested a final decision had not been made.",
      "\"We're still engaged in conversation. Obviously there's a lot of litigation on that,\" he added. \"As that continues to play out \u2026 we'll see where we land.\"",
      "Asked why the administration had not articulated a policy position on DACA this time around, Edlow said the question should be posed to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, USCIS' parent agency.",
      "In recent years, federal courts in Texas and Louisiana have declared DACA \u2014 and the Biden administration's efforts to codify the policy \u2014 illegal. But they have allowed current recipients to continue renewing their two-year work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "The Republican-led states challenging DACA's legality, however, recently asked a federal judge in Texas to order the Trump administration to gradually terminate the policy. It's unclear when or how the judge will rule.",
      "In 2020, Edlow, then USCIS' deputy director, agreed with the GOP-led states' argument against DACA, calling it a \"de facto amnesty program.\"",
      "Pressed on whether he still believes that, Edlow said \"I do.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday showed off a model of what may be his next Washington, D.C., development project, an arch that resembles the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and is being referred to informally as the \"Arc de Trump.\"",
      "The president showed off a model of the arch at a White House dinner Wednesday night for a group of wealthy donors who are funding his White House ballroom project. Mockups he displayed bore the caption \"Independence Arch.\"",
      "\"It's going to be really beautiful. I think it's going to be fantastic,\" Trump said, as he held a model of the arch. \"There's a rendering of what it will look like. You have three sizes.\" He added, \"I happen to think the large one,\" indicating his preference.",
      "CBS News' Ed O'Keefe asked the president who the arch is for, and Mr. Trump pointed at himself: \"Me.\"",
      "A post shared by CBS News (@cbsnews)",
      "The arch is to be built on the Arlington, Virginia, side of the Memorial Bridge over the Potomac River, between the entrances to Arlington National Cemetery and the Lincoln Memorial. The arch is supposed to be completed in time for the country's 250th anniversary celebration next year. Mr. Trump has a model of it sitting in the Oval Office.",
      "Mr. Trump did not say how much the arch will cost or how it will be funded, as his administration slashes federal jobs during the government shutdown and says federal spending must be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump isn't the first to imagine an arch at that location. In 1902, the National Park Service plans included a triumphal arch that would honor President and Union General Ulysses S. Grant, but the arch was never built.",
      "The Arlington Memorial Bridge, open to traffic in 1932, is the ceremonial entrance to Washington, D.C. Its design is neoclassical, Mr. Trump's favorite architectural style, and features like sculptures of eagles, bison and oak leaves were intended to invoke national strength and unity, according to the\u00a0National Park Service."

    "summary": "The Trump administration will continue paying FBI agents despite the ongoing government shutdown that has frozen paychecks for nearly all federal workers, FBI Director Kash Patel announced.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration will continue paying FBI agents despite the ongoing government shutdown that has frozen paychecks for nearly all federal workers, FBI Director Kash Patel announced Wednesday.",
      "\"You've found a way to get these individuals paid during a government shutdown,\" Patel said to President Trump during an unrelated Oval Office event. \"On behalf of the FBI, it's a great debt that we owe you.\"",
      "Patel did not specify the source of the funds that would be used to pay the agents.",
      "The announcement follows recent moves by the administration to ensure members of the military receive paychecks this week despite most federal workers going without pay until the government reopens.",
      "\"We got the people that we want paid, paid,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs. \"We want the FBI paid and we want the military paid.\"",
      "Military service members were set to be paid Wednesday after Mr. Trump issued a memo directing the Pentagon to use other unspent funds to make payroll. Around $8 billion in funds from the previous fiscal year had been identified to cover the mid-month paychecks, a Pentagon official said earlier. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also said the Coast Guard, which falls under the purview of her department, would receive paychecks this week from funds in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" that passed earlier this year.",
      "When funding lapsed on Oct. 1, agencies began implementing shutdown procedures to send hundreds of thousands of workers home on furlough. While essential employees and those whose duties are funded through other means stayed on the job, almost no federal workers had been expected to be paid until Congress reopens the government. Workers are expected to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "Under the Justice Department's shutdown plans, no FBI agents were placed on furlough, and only about 10% of department employees overall were expected to be sent home.",
      "The FBI Agents Association thanked Mr. Trump for ensuring agents are paid, but noted that the FBI's workforce also includes people other than agents, including analysts and professional staff. The group called for Congress to reopen the government.",
      "\"If the shutdown continues, the Bureau will be forced to curtail travel, training, hiring, and other vital operations, slowing investigations and weakening coordination with law enforcement partners,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "The administration's moves to pay certain federal workers has prompted questions about its legal authority to do so, since Congress appropriates funds and gives agencies a limited scope for what they can be used for. In previous shutdowns, Congress has voted on stand-alone measures to pay the military. And the Oct. 15 deadline for military paychecks had been widely viewed as a possible off-ramp in the shutdown amid an impasse between the parties that has extended into a third week. But the moves to unilaterally fund the mid-month paychecks took the pressure off lawmakers, at least temporarily.",
      "Republican leaders in Congress tried to resume that pressure on Democrats to reopen the government and pay the military Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson warned that members of the military are in danger of missing their next paycheck later this month if the shutdown continues, calling the administration's move to pay service members a \"temporary fix.\"",
      "Johnson, asked about funds for law enforcement, said he spoke with Mr. Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought at the White House on Tuesday. He said \"they're having to triage federal spending,\" and must determine \"what are the most essential services, personnel, policies and what are not.\"",
      "\"When we look at that, we prioritize troops and law enforcement,\" Johnson said.",
      "Separately, the Trump administration has sought to lay off thousands of federal employees during the shutdown, drawing\u00a0pushback from some Republican lawmakers and prompting a court ruling on Wednesday\u00a0temporarily halting the firings. Mr. Trump said his administration is \"terminating tremendous numbers of Democrat projects.\"",
      "\"We're getting rid of a lot of things that we never wanted because of the fact that they made this stupid move,\" the president told reporters."

      "New York \u2014 A posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre offers an expanded account about her long-standing claims to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to billionaires, politicians and Britain's Prince Andrew.",
      "Many Epstein victims have told their stories publicly over the years, but Giuffre always stood apart with her claim to have been \"loaned\" to Epstein's rich and powerful friends and acquaintances.",
      "Titled \"Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,\" the book is set for release Tuesday. It was co-written by author-journalist Amy Wallace, and was completed before Giuffre died by suicide in April.",
      "Giuffre told her story in interviews and lawsuits for 16 years. The book, which she said enabled her to tell her whole story and \"provide context where it has been sorely lacking,\" revisits her allegations involving the men who socialized with Epstein, but carefully so. In many instances, she has left their names out, writing that she either didn't know them or feared retaliation.",
      "But she has added details and a description of how her alleged experiences with Epstein \u2014 after what she said was a traumatic childhood and other instances of sexual abuse \u2014 affected her psychologically and left her struggling to cope.",
      "Giuffre also seeks to explain how she was able to rationalize remaining in what she called \"Epstein's sickening world\" for nearly two years.",
      "\"I needed him not to be a selfish, cruel pedophile. So I told myself he wasn't one,\" she wrote about her mindset at the time.",
      "The start of Giuffre's time with Epstein",
      "Giuffre first met Epstein in the summer of 2000, weeks before she turned 17, while working at the spa at now-President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "In the book, she retells the story of being hired by Epstein's longtime companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, to work as a \"masseuse\" for Epstein.",
      "She said Epstein and Maxwell coaxed her into performing sex acts during massages, then began taking her to his luxurious homes in New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands and New Mexico, where she says she met \u2014 and sometimes was directed to have sex with \u2014 numerous famous friends and acquaintances of Epstein.",
      "Maxwell has denied participating in any sexual abuse and called Giuffre's account of being trafficked a lie, as have all of the men she has publicly accused.",
      "Giuffre and Prince Andrew",
      "In the book, Giuffre details alleged encounters with Prince Andrew, who she sued in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17. Andrew denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022.",
      "In an excerpt published by The Guardian, Giuffre says, \"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.\"",
      "Giuffre added that, \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Speculation that Epstein was involved in a global sex trafficking ring continues to cause headaches for the Trump administration, which has been under pressure to publicly release more records related to the FBI's investigations of Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Even Giuffre, in the concluding pages of the book, asks: \"Where are those videotapes the FBI confiscated from Epstein's houses? And why haven't they led to the prosecution of any more abusers?\"",
      "In the book, she describes meeting Trump once at Mar-a-Lago, where her father worked, but doesn't accuse Trump of wrongdoing.",
      "Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" Giuffre said, adding that he offered to help her find babysitting work.",
      "Giuffre also mentions that she was once present for dinners Epstein had with former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, but she also didn't accuse them of any wrongdoing.",
      "Giuffre broke off contact with Epstein in 2002.",
      "Three years later, Palm Beach police began investigating Epstein after the parents of another teenage girl reported that their daughter had also been paid for a sex act. Police identified multiple underage girls with similar stories about being hired to give sexualized massages, but the investigation ended in 2008 when Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence.",
      "In the book, Giuffre wrote that Epstein and Maxwell persuaded her to become a recruiter who found other girls who would perform sexualized massages on Epstein \u2014 something she called \"the worst thing I've ever done in my life.\"",
      "\"The faces of the girls I recruited will always haunt me,\" she wrote.",
      "Federal prosecutors in New York brought new charges against Epstein in 2019 but, authorities say, he killed himself in jail as he awaited trial. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of charges including sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Giuffre wasn't part of either case.",
      "CBS News and The Associated Press typically do not name people who say they are the victims of sexual abuse unless they have come forward publicly with their stories, as Giuffre has."

    "summary": "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems.",
    "story": [
      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday issued a sweeping emergency order directing all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in certain devices and software made by F5, a technology vendor, after confirming a nation-state cyber actor gained unauthorized access to F5's source code.",
      "CISA \u2014 a part of the Department of Homeland Security that manages risks to the U.S.'s cyber and physical infrastructure \u2014 issued\u00a0Emergency Directive 26-01\u00a0following the company's disclosure that a foreign threat actor had maintained long-term, persistent access to its internal development and engineering environments using source code.",
      "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems. F5 said it first discovered the attack in August but did not disclose exactly when it began.",
      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",
      "F5 is a publicly traded American technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.",
      "Justice Department delayed breach announcement",
      "Earlier Wednesday, F5 disclosed the breach in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "In the SEC 8-K report, F5 said the Justice Department on Sept. 12 \"determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted.\" It's one of the first times a company has publicly acknowledged DOJ intervention under the SEC's\u00a0cybersecurity disclosure rules.",
      "The rules were adopted in July 2023 and require companies to report cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining that a material event has occurred.",
      "\"Under item 1.05(c), the Department may grant a delay after finding that a disclosure required by Item 1.05 would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety,\" a Department of Justice spokesperson told CBS News in a statement.",
      "F5 CEO Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou signed the filing, which said the company learned of the attack on Aug. 9 and launched an investigation alongside cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike, Mandiant and others, with assistance from federal law enforcement and unnamed \"government partners.\"",
      "\"During the course of its investigation, the Company determined that the threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to certain F5 systems, including the BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platform,\" F5 wrote in its filing.",
      "What's in the CISA emergency order",
      "CISA's order directed federal civilian executive branch agencies \u2014 which include the Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of the Treasury and the Federal Trade Commission, among others \u2014 to inventory F5 BIG-IP products, which are application delivery and security services.",
      "The federal agencies need to evaluate if their networks are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by Oct. 22, the emergency order stated. They must also complete scoping reports identifying affected devices by Oct. 29.",
      "There are currently thousands of F5 devices in use across federal networks, Anderson told CBS News. The cybersecurity agency said it expects to know more about the scope of exposure by the end of the month.",
      "CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement that the agency remains \"steadfast\" in its mission to defend U.S. networks, even amid the ongoing government shutdown and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.",
      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",
      "Anderson confirmed that CISA is not aware of any current data breaches within federal agencies, though the directive is designed to uncover any potential compromises. He said the campaign appears to be part of a broader nation-state effort targeting elements of the U.S. technology supply chain, not just one vendor.",
      "\"The broader goal here is persistent access \u2014 to gather intelligence, hold infrastructure hostage, or position themselves for future attacks,\" Anderson told CBS News during Wednesday's briefing.",
      "CISA declined to name the country behind the attack, citing ongoing investigations.",
      "\"The U.S. government is not making a public attribution at this time,\" said Marcy McCarthy, CISA's director of public affairs.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",
      "Working through the government shutdown",
      "Pressed on the government's ability to respond amid furloughs and staffing reductions at CISA, Anderson acknowledged the agency's challenges but said it remains operational.",
      "\"We're sustaining essential functions and providing timely guidance like this to mitigate risk,\" he said. \"This is core mission work for CISA \u2014 exactly what we should be doing.\"",
      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

      "But to even have the chance to do so, Democrat Janet Mills will first have to make it through what is already primed to be a contentious Senate primary between establishment voices and progressives at a crucial time in her party.",
      "Mills announced on Tuesday that she will run in Maine's 2026 Senate contest, offering Democrats one route to try to unseat the longtime GOP incumbent Collins and thin out the Republican Senate majority in Washington.",
      "\"I won't sit idly by while Maine people suffer and politicians like Susan Collins bend the knee as if this were normal,\" Mills said in an announcement video posted early Tuesday. \"My life's work has prepared me for this fight, and I'm ready to win. This election will be a simple choice: Is Maine going to bow down or stand up? I know my answer.\"",
      "CBS News reported last week\u00a0that Mills was expected to launch her campaign on Tuesday.",
      "The 77-year-old governor has been viewed as a key recruiting target for national Democrats, who face long odds of flipping control of the Senate back next year given a difficult map of races. Mills was first elected governor after winning by more than seven points in 2018, and she won reelection by a 13-point margin four years later.",
      "But recent political history, both locally and across the country, may upend expectations about how Mills will fare in what could become one of the tensest contests of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Collins has served as one of Maine's senators since 1997, establishing herself as a key moderate Republican voice, albeit one who tends to frustrate members of both major parties at times. During the 2020 presidential election, defeating Collins was a major, and well-funded, priority for Democrats. But Collins still managed to win re-election by more than eight points, even as Democrat Joe Biden's statewide margin over President Trump in Maine was nine points.",
      "The 72-year-old Collins has never lost a Senate race in Maine, her last defeat coming in a run for governor back in 1994.",
      "Mills' expected entry into the Senate race is already being met with some dismissiveness on the progressive side. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats, is rallying around Graham Platner, a younger first-time statewide candidate who is already in the Senate race and, according to his online campaign bio, is a military veteran and oyster farmer.",
      "\"Graham Platner is a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins,\" Sanders said recently on social media. \"It's disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.\"",
      "In the fallout from a difficult 2024 election cycle where Democrats lost the presidency and Senate, and failed to retake control of the House, there have been persistent questions about how the party can recover. One tension rippling through the party is the subject of generational change, and whether to eschew the older candidates closer in age to Biden, 82, and instead nominate people who can try to revive a Democratic brand that has suffered in recent years.",
      "With Mills' entry into the race on Tuesday, Democrats in Maine may be on a collision course over those national concerns already rippling through other contests where the party's future direction could be at stake."

      "That firing ultimately set into motion special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\" Mueller's probe found that Russia interfered in the election and several Trump campaign officials had contacts with Russians, but did not establish that campaign staff illegally conspired with the Russian government.",
      "For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him \"morally unfit\" to be president in a 2018 interview.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund also contended that \"prosecutors should never be fired for refusing to bring charges they conclude are unfounded, even if the president orders them to do so. Yet that appears to be just what President Trump has done in order to charge Mr. Comey and Ms. James.\"",
      "The criminal cases were filed against Comey and James less than three weeks after President Trump called for their prosecution in a post on social media.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who had been appointed to the position by Mr. Trump, resigned after he did not bring prosecutions of Comey and James, and the president announced he had been fired. A Trump White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, was then installed as acting U.S. attorney and within days secured grand jury indictments against Comey and James \u2014 with prosecutors charging Comey less than a week before the statute of limitations ran out.",
      "Halligan has defended both of the prosecutions. In the hours after James's indictment last week, Halligan said in a statement, \"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.\"",
      "After charging Comey, Halligan said, \"The charges as alleged in this case represent a breach of the public trust at an extraordinary level,\"",
      "Comey is charged with making a false statement and obstruction of Congress, for allegedly lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 when he denied that he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "During an arraignment proceeding last week, Comey's defense attorney told a judge that Comey would seek a dismissal of the case next week, arguing the case is an unlawful vindictive prosecution against one of the president's critics.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund's request for a federal review of Halligan's cases also argued, \"The same pattern has now been repeated a second time in as many weeks with respect to another victim of President Trump's wrath. Ms. Halligan's prosecution of Letitia James on two counts of 'bank fraud' and a 'false statement' appears to be a further attempt to fulfill President Trump's personal vendetta against his political enemies.\"",
      "\"Trump's animus against Ms. James stems from having successfully brought a years-long civil fraud case against the Trump Organization, which included judgments against President Trump and two of his sons and imposed a court monitor with limits on their ability to conduct business in New York,\" the fund's letter continued.",
      "James is scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 24, to answer to charges of mortgage fraud and false statement in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home in 2020. James has also denied wrongdoing.",
      "The Office of the Justice Department Inspector General is on furlough because of the shutdown and did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 07:14:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

      "\"Odd radio circles,\" or ORCs, are enormous and unexplained phenomena that can only be detected using radio telescopes. So far, just a handful have ever been identified.",
      "Now, researchers at the University of Mumbai in India, with help from citizen scientists and the world's largest low-frequency radio telescope, have pinpointed \"the most distant and the most powerful ORC known to date,\" according to the London-based\u00a0Royal Astronomical Society. The group published a study on the new finding in the October issue of its scientific journal, the\u00a0Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.",
      "While ORCs detected in the past looked like one bright circle, this one consisted of two intersecting rings, which is rare. Previously, research into ORCs suggested the rings could be caused by shockwaves that were triggered by the merging of supermassive black holes or galaxies, but the latest findings propose that they actually could be linked to \"superwind\" flowing out of their host galaxies, the Royal Astronomical Society said.",
      "\"ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen \u2014 and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand-in-hand,\" Ananda Hota, the founder of the\u00a0RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory, a platform where citizen scientists helped spot the ORC, said in a statement.",
      "\"The fact that citizen scientists uncovered them highlights the continued importance of human pattern recognition, even in the age of machine learning,\" Pratik Dabhade, of the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw, Poland, who co-authored the study, said in a separate statement. \"These discoveries show that ORCs and radio rings are not isolated curiosities \u2013 they are part of a broader family of exotic plasma structures shaped by black hole jets, winds, and their environments.\""

    "story": [
      "A weak spot in the Earth's magnetic field is growing over the South Atlantic Ocean, according to more than a decade's worth of satellite data collected by scientists.",
      "The magnetic field surrounding Earth protects the planet from cosmic radiation and particles charged by the sun. Scientists believe it is generated by the outer core of the Earth, according to a news release from the European Space Agency. The ESA said the \"global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron\" in that layer of the planet creates electrical currents that generate the magnetic field.",
      "The weak spot, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, was first identified in the 19th century, the ESA said. It is southeast of South America and southwest of Africa. In this area, the planet's magnetic field dips down, according to NASA. Satellites that pass over it are hit with higher doses of incoming radiation, which can cause technical issues and even blackouts.",
      "The ESA studied the spot for 11 years, from 2014 to 2025. Three different satellites, known as Swarm, precisely measured the planet's magnetic signals during that period. The data was published in the journal Science Direct.",
      "The satellite data showed that the South Atlantic Anomaly had expanded by an area \"nearly half the size of continental Europe,\" or about two million square miles. The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.",
      "\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"",
      "Finlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.",
      "The ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.",
      "The satellites will continue to study the planet's magnetic field in the coming years, the ESA said.",
      "\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\""

      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday issued a sweeping emergency order directing all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in certain devices and software made by F5, a technology vendor, after confirming a nation-state cyber actor gained unauthorized access to F5's source code.",
      "CISA \u2014 a part of the Department of Homeland Security that manages risks to the U.S.'s cyber and physical infrastructure \u2014 issued\u00a0Emergency Directive 26-01\u00a0following the company's disclosure that a foreign threat actor had maintained long-term, persistent access to its internal development and engineering environments using source code.",
      "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems. F5 said it first discovered the attack in August but did not disclose exactly when it began.",
      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",
      "F5 is a publicly traded American technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.",
      "Justice Department delayed breach announcement",
      "Earlier Wednesday, F5 disclosed the breach in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "In the SEC 8-K report, F5 said the Justice Department on Sept. 12 \"determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted.\" It's one of the first times a company has publicly acknowledged DOJ intervention under the SEC's\u00a0cybersecurity disclosure rules.",

      "The federal agencies need to evaluate if their networks are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by Oct. 22, the emergency order stated. They must also complete scoping reports identifying affected devices by Oct. 29.",
      "There are currently thousands of F5 devices in use across federal networks, Anderson told CBS News. The cybersecurity agency said it expects to know more about the scope of exposure by the end of the month.",
      "CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement that the agency remains \"steadfast\" in its mission to defend U.S. networks, even amid the ongoing government shutdown and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.",
      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",
      "Anderson confirmed that CISA is not aware of any current data breaches within federal agencies, though the directive is designed to uncover any potential compromises.

      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",

      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

      "Steven, a father of two, is among those who have filed lawsuits as his family tries to rebuild their life after his son was allegedly targeted.",
      "He said that allowing his teen son to play Roblox seemed like a safe bet \u2014 at first.",
      "\"I set up every parental control I could find and did the best I could,\" he told CBS News in an exclusive interview, asking that CBS News only use his first name for privacy reasons.",
      "But despite the platform's parental controls, an alleged sex offender posing as a 16-year-old befriended his 13-year-old son in the popular \"Pet Simulator\" game, according to the lawsuit. Steven alleged the predator offered his son Roblox gift cards in exchange for sexually explicit photos, which his son sent via Discord \u2013 a separate gaming and chat platform.",
      "\"At a certain point it was, 'tell me what your address is' and when he said no, he's like, 'Well, I have these photos of you, I'll tell your parents,'\" Steven said of the interaction between the predator and his son back in July 2024. \"He was 30 feet down the hall from us and just\u2014 felt too trapped to \u2026 come and talk to us.\"",
      "It was \"pure luck,\" Steven said, that he found out \u2014 because of a threatening message from the perpetrator that allegedly popped up as he was replacing the screen on his son's phone, which had cracked.",
      "The person has since pleaded guilty to first-degree felony child endangerment.",
      "Lawsuits against Roblox, Discord",
      "Steven's family is among dozens of families, as well as attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, who are suing Roblox and other tech platforms, alleging they allowed sexual predators access to their children.",
      "Kentucky announced a lawsuit against Roblox last month, and Louisiana filed a suit against the platform in August.",
      "\"For years, Roblox has ignored this crisis so it could continue turning a profit,\" Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement. \"Our responsibility is to protect Kentucky children from online exploitation by these predators and the companies like Roblox that knowingly facilitate it.\"",
      "Steven said his family is suing Roblox as well as Discord, an instant messaging and social platform, because \"at the end of the day, the thing they seem to care about the most is the bottom line, their profit.\"",
      "\"It almost feels like they're a haven for \u2026 predators, pedophiles, dangerous individuals and like they should do better,\" he said.",
      "Steven's attorney Alexandra Walsh, with the firm Anapol Weiss, is currently investigating hundreds of cases of child endangerment and grooming that allegedly started on Roblox.",
      "\"Roblox was the gateway. Roblox is the site that ... in this case that gave this predator, this very dangerous man, the ability to find a target and groom this child,\" Walsh said.",
      "Steven has moved his family across the country to have a new start as he supports his son through depression and PTSD, he said.",
      "\"This thing happens so much faster than you can ever imagine,\" Steven said. \"You want to believe that like \u2026 you've done everything you can and that it'll never happen to me and I thought the same thing until it did.\"",
      "Roblox and Discord respond",
      "Matt Kaufman, the chief safety officer at Roblox, said the platform does not allow image sharing in filtered chats and has rolled out over 100 new safety features this year, including age estimation and increased chat monitoring.",
      "\"We have safety systems that are in place by default and a lot of these situations that you're talking about, like extortion, people sharing, graphic images, they simply cannot happen on Roblox,\" Kaufman said.",
      "Until recently, Roblox did not verify players' ages. By the end of the year, all users will have to pass its checks to communicate within the platform. According to Roblox, these checks will include \"a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification and verified parental consent.\"",
      "Currently, any communication between adult users and those between 13 and 17 is prohibited, unless a real life confirmed relationship can be proven.",
      "\"For users 13 to 17 who confirm their age through Facial Age Estimation, adding a Trusted Connection, whether a peer or an 18 or older user, requires an existing real-world relationship, verified by a QR scan or Contact Importer,\" Roblox says on its site.",
      "Roblox's chief safety officer  Kaufman said the company has caught and self-reported 23,000 incidents of\u00a0potentially harmful content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children so far this year.",
      "\"What's really important about these cases that we report is: we report when we see signs of something that doesn't look safe,\" Kaufman said. \"Any platform of our size \u2026 it draws bad actors and our job is to do the best that we possibly can to prevent anything from happening on our platform and to report those situations as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Discord told CBS News it won't comment on pending litigation, but said in a statement that it is \"deeply committed to safety,\" and works to \"prevent the spread of sexual exploitation and grooming.\""

    "summary": "David Pogue looks at our nation's tradition of pioneering inventors, from Thomas Edison's R&amp;D facility in Menlo Park, N.J., to today's entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to \"Shark Tank.\"",
    "story": [
      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

    "summary": "In reporting on the case of Joe Shymanski, a Washington, D.C., photographer murdered in 2023, \"48 Hours\"' Nikki Battiste says the story took her into unfamiliar territory: confronting someone she grew up with.",
    "story": [
      "As a reporter, you see a lot of strange things. You witness the most dramatic and traumatic parts of other people's lives. You count on being able to control how it all affects you. But you never expect investigating someone else's past will lead you back into your own.",
      "And that's exactly what happened to me, reporting on the case of Joe Shymanski, a Washington, D.C., photographer murdered in 2023. Covering this story took me back into some of the most familiar terrain of my life \u2014 my tiny, Pennsylvania hometown. But it also took me into unfamiliar territory: confronting someone I grew up with caught up in a murder case.",
      "Heather Snyder and I hadn't communicated since 1998, the year I literally crowned her my successor as high school homecoming queen. Fast forward to 2025, and I discovered that the very same Heather I knew was a central character in this story. She was now Joe Shymanski's ex-wife. She was the one who reported Joe Shymanski missing and it was Heather's boyfriend after leaving Joe Shymanski, Brandon Holbrook, who became authorities' prime suspect in Joe's murder.",
      "In an exclusive interview, Heather answered my questions about her relationship with Holbrook. She has an alibi and emphatically told us she had no involvement in Joe's murder. She has never been identified by authorities as a suspect or charged with a crime in connection with the Shymanski case.",
      "But Heather was the only known link between Joe Shymanski and Holbrook. And Joe Shymanski's loved ones started asking questions about her.",
      "\"She just needed it done and she found her person that would do that for her,\" Joe's niece Janine Shymanski said.",
      "Janine Shymanski and other friends and relatives spelled out their suspicions of Heather Snyder and Heather addressed those suspicions in\u00a0\"My Uncle Joe's Murder,\"\u00a0an all-new \"48 Hours\" airing Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025, at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Heather said she began dating Joe Shymanski when they were vendors at a weekly Washington, D.C., food and crafts fair at the historic Eastern Market. Joe Shymanski sold his photographs there and Heather had a vegetable business. She had three children from a previous marriage, but wanted a big family and she remembers being excited to learn that Joe Shymanski wanted kids. She said that in the beginning, he was funny, charming and swept her off her feet.",
      "\"It was like a fairy tale,\" Heather said.",
      "They married in July 2014, Heather said, and bought a house in Calvert County, Maryland. She gave birth to a daughter and a son a year apart. But she says Joe Shymanski soon became obsessive about his kids and started to push her and her three older children aside. She says he became emotionally abusive to her and in one instance, she claims, he got physical.",
      "The Shymanski family and friends say Heather Snyder's allegations do not match the Joe Shymanski they knew. One friend told me Heather was attracted to Joe Shymanski's money \u2014 an allegation she denies. Snyder says the pandemic only made things worse. She took the kids and left Joe Shymanski in July 2021, moving back to our hometown in Pennsylvania. Before long, she says, she began seeing Holbrook, who she met online. But Joe Shymanski's friend Anneli Werner said the turbulence of Heather and Joe's relationship was far from over.",
      "\"Joe was in an ugly, contentious divorce,\" Werner remembered.",
      "By the summer of 2023, Joe Shymanski had bought a million-dollar life insurance policy listing his two minor children as beneficiaries. The court had awarded him and Heather joint custody of the kids but gave Joe Shymanski primary physical custody when school was in session. And the judge had also reduced the amount Joe Shymanski owed her in the settlement.",
      "\"Joe had started winning,\" Anneli said.",
      "Joe Shymanski reported missing",
      "It was Labor Day 2023 at 7:47 p.m. when authorities got the call from Heather to report Joe Shymanski missing. She told them she had driven to her ex-husband's house to drop off their children in a custody exchange but had not found him home. So, she said she checked with the neighbors and then called 911. Investigators found Joe's keys and phone inside his house. When a sheriff's deputy escorted Heather inside to get pajamas for the kids, his body camera shows her getting emotional.",
      "The next day, Calvert County investigators questioned Heather at the sheriff's office.",
      "\"Are you in any relationship right now?\" asked Calvert County investigator Joshua Buck. \"No,\" Heather replied. \"No boyfriends or \u2014 ?\" Buck continued. \"No,\" she answered. \"I had a boyfriend but, briefly. But I don't.\"",
      "Heather told Calvert County investigators she had recently broken up with Holbrook, who also lived in Pennsylvania. But they soon unearthed an image of his truck and license plate near Joe Shymanski's house in Maryland the day Joe disappeared. The Calvert County, Maryland, Sheriff's Office, which declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview, sent investigators to Pennsylvania. With the help of Pennsylvania police, they approached Holbrook's house at about 11 p.m. on Sept. 5, 2023.",
      "When they brought Holbrook to police headquarters for questioning, he told them he was a driver for a plant that processed waste from chicken slaughterhouses. Despite the camera images showing his truck near Joe Shymanski's house, Holbrook claimed he hadn't been there \u2014 or anywhere in Maryland \u2014 around the time Joe disappeared. But investigators found items that struck them as curious. On Holbrook's property, there were firearms, plastic tarps, rubber gloves and cleaning fluid. There was also an open package of power saw blades without a matching saw.",
      "\"Is that a tool that's powerful enough to dismember a body?\" I asked Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, Detective Jessica Aurand, who helped investigate the case. \"\u2026 Possibly,\" she answered.",
      "By this point, authorities had also noted a strange smell coming from Holbrook's truck in the driveway, said Mifflin County Police Department Sgt. John Chester. In the back, they found something an investigator noted appeared to be human blood.",
      "\"It looked like a homicide scene,\" Chester said.",
      "But the blood in the truck would turn out to have come from an animal.",
      "\"Because he had access to the \u2026 chicken plant, did he put stuff in there and cover it up with chicken remains?\" Aurand wondered aloud.",
      "Despite having no body, authorities arrested Holbrook shortly afterward. The next day in a field near Holbrook's house, they located human remains that later turned out to match Joe Shymanski.",
      "All of this happened only about 45 minutes from where Heather Snyder and I grew up.",
      "Both our families still live in Newport, Pennsylvania, home to only about 1,500 people. Even when you add up the cars and the horse-drawn, Amish buggies, there still isn't enough traffic for a single stoplight. As a kid there, I never dreamed I would become a contributor to \"48 Hours.\" And if you'd told me I was one day going to interview a former teammate mentioned in connection with a murder case, I would have said you were crazy.",
      "It was downright surreal when a \"48 Hours\" producer first told me that a murder victim's family had questions about someone I knew in my youth. The Heather I remembered was a top student, a cheerleader and the treasurer of her class. We played field hockey together.",
      "I knew Heather might not want to talk to me. If I could convince her to do an interview, I also knew it would mean asking her the toughest questions. When I learned another national news program was looking into the story, I contacted Heather. As I suspected, she told me it was too soon to talk to me. She said she wouldn't consider meeting until after Holbrook's trial last spring.",
      "The trial of Brandon Holbrook",
      "Prosecutors would argue Holbrook shot Joe Shymanski to death in Joe's Maryland driveway, then drove his body back to Pennsylvania, dismembering him and disposing of his remains. They showed the images of Holbrook's truck near Joe Shymanski's house that night and video showing Holbrook shopping for cleaning supplies the next morning. They even showed video of Holbrook dumping what turned out to be human remains next to the parking lot outside the store.",
      "Holbrook's defense team had little choice but to acknowledge there was evidence he was involved in disposing of Joe's body. But they pointed out that there were no forensics tying him to the murder itself \u2014 nothing placing him at Joe Shymanski's house \u2014 the images of his truck near Joe's house hadn't been clear enough to identify the driver, nor anything proving Joe Shymanski \u2014 alive or dead \u2014 was ever at Holbrook's house.",
      "Defense attorney Brendan Callahan insisted Holbrook had no motive to want Joe Shymanski dead and that his client may not have been the only one involved. Callahan said authorities failed to sufficiently investigate Heather Snyder and were slow to recover a gun she told them she had at home. He says they never searched her property.",
      "\"Only one person's life is better today than it was before the murder of Joseph Shymanski,\" said Callahan. \"And that is Heather Snyder.\"",
      "Callahan argued Heather might have stood to gain custody of her two youngest children and, since they were minors, control over any life insurance payout they received.",
      "In all, Heather Snyder was mentioned more than 400 times in the Brandon Holbrook murder trial \u2013 so many times it felt to me like she was on trial too.",
      "Both sides had listed Heather as a witness. Everyone in the crowded courtroom wanted to hear what she had to say under oath. On the fifth day of trial testimony, she was called to the stand. But Heather invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The jury gasped. But prosecutors later introduced Heather's alibi: photos taken in her Pennsylvania home and video showing her buying a pizza in a Newport grocery store around the time Joe Shymanski was killed about a three-hour drive away.",
      "It took the jury just 80 minutes to convict Holbrook of first-degree, premeditated murder. As I said, Heather Snyder has never been charged with a crime in this case.",
      "Questions for Heather Snyder",
      "After the trial, I met with Heather to talk about doing an interview. I think it's fair to say she was reluctant, but she told me she understood she was the best person to tell her story. She also seemed keenly aware that Joe Shymanski's family felt she was somehow involved in his death. She said she wanted to set the record straight and ultimately, she agreed to sit down with me for our \"48 Hours\" report. No questions were off limits.",
      "On a rainy night in May 2025, our team set up our gear in a converted barn just minutes from both of our parents' homes. As I was waiting for Heather to arrive, I recorded my thoughts in a kind of video diary.",
      "When we began the interview itself, Heather seemed nervous, but before long, she became more poised.",
      "\"Did you ever say to Brandon Holbrook, I wish Joe were dead?\" I asked her.\u202f\"No,\" she said, and continued, \"\u2026 the most I said to Brandon was that I thought Joe should be in jail for the way he was acting.\"",
      "\"Did Brandon tell you he wanted to kill Joe?\" I asked. \"Nope,\" she said. \"Did you help him cover it up?\" I continued. \"Nope. Nope,\" she answered.",
      "Heather told me that a criminal lawyer advised her to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege at the Holbrook trial. \"If you don't have anything to hide, why not just get up there and testify?\" I asked. \"\u2026 People twist your words,\" Heather replied.",
      "I asked her about texts with Holbrook in which he suggests \"other solutions\" for her problems with Joe.",
      "\"I thought it was a \u2014 just a joke,\" Heather said. \"It didn't cross your mind for a second \u2013.\" \"No,\" she responded. \"That he might hurt Joe?\" I continued. \"No,\" Heather said.",
      "I also asked her about text messages about her hope that karma would catch up with Joe in which she had said she was \"tired of being patient.\"",
      "\"That's how I was feeling \u2026\" Heather told me. \"Do you think \u2026 that may have triggered Brandon?\" I asked. \"I don't know,\" she said.",
      "\"Are you afraid authorities will come for you?\" I wanted to know. \"No,\" Heather said. \"Not at all?\" I asked. \"I'm not worried at all, no ...\" she said.",
      "We asked Calvert County's top prosecutor, Robert Harvey, for an interview about the Joe Shymanski murder investigation and about Heather Snyder. Harvey declined our request but wrote to us that there was \"\u2026 a thorough and exhaustive investigation \u2026\" into Mr. Shymanski's death. \"Mr. Holbrook received a 'fair and impartial trial \u2026'\" Harvey continued. \"Because Mr. Holbrook's case is under appeal \u2026 it remains open,\" Harvey continued. \"Therefore, I am not going to respond to questions regarding the investigation and I am not going to speculate on what may or may not happen in the future.\"",
      "We also asked Pennsylvania authorities about the status of the case:",
      "\"Is there a current investigation into Heather Snyder?\" I asked. \"I can't answer that question,\" said Aurand. \"Should there be?\" I continued. \"I can't answer that question,\" Aurand responded. \"Do you think Heather Snyder is involved in this crime in any way?\" I continued. \"I can't answer that,\" Aurand said. \"But you do know the answer,\" I asked.\u202f\"Yes. But I'm not allowed to say,\" Aurand said.",
      "Heather Snyder told me despite it all, she wants to keep Joe Shymanski's memory alive for their children. She knows the Shymanski family wants to see them and says she is open to the idea, assuming they stop publicly pointing a finger at her.",
      "She added she still has love for Holbrook, though she believes he belongs behind bars. \"I think obviously psychologically he snapped over something,\" she told me. \"I think he did something horrible, horrific. He hurt my family. He hurt me.\" Last July, a judge sentenced Brandon Holbrook to life in prison with no parole.",
      "\"So many people watching are gonna be frustrated,\" I said. \"Uh-huh,\" she agreed. \"\u2026 and they're gonna think it \u2014 it just \u2014 logically you have to had known something.\" \"Right,\" she said. \"But I didn't. That's the torturous part, because people will \u2014 it's almost like they want to believe that I was involved with it. They want that true-crime narrative. And it just simply wasn't the case.\""

    "summary": "The remnants of Typhoon Halong brought record high water to low-lying Alaska Native communities last weekend and washed away homes, some with people inside.",
    "story": [
      "The house rocked as though an earthquake had struck, and suddenly it was floating. Water seeped in through the front door, and waves smacked the big glass window.",
      "From the lone dry room where Alexie Stone and his brothers and children gathered, he could look outside and see under the water, like an aquarium. A shed drifted toward them, threatening to shatter the glass, but turned away before it hit.",
      "The house came to rest just a few feet away from where it previously stood, after another building blocked its path. But it remains uninhabitable, along with most of the rest of Stone's Alaska Native village of Kipnuk, following an immense storm surge that flooded coastal parts of western Alaska, left one person dead and two missing, and prompted a huge evacuation effort to airlift more than 1,000 residents to safety.",
      "\"In our village, we'd say that we're Native strong, we have Native pride, and nothing can break us down. But this is the hardest that we went through,\" Stone said Thursday outside the Alaska Airlines Center, an arena in Anchorage, where he and hundreds of others were being sheltered. \"Everybody's taking care of everybody in there. We're all thankful that we're all alive.\"",
      "The remnants of Typhoon Halong brought record high water to low-lying Alaska Native communities last weekend and washed away homes, some with people inside. Makeshift shelters were quickly established and swelled to hold about 1,500 people, an extraordinary number in a sparsely populated region where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year.",
      "Bryan Fisher, the director of the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told CBS News on Thursday that this was one of the largest disasters the state has ever dealt with.",
      "Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced on social media Thursday evening that he submitted a request to the White House asking that President Trump issue a disaster declaration for the region.",
      "Many of the evacuees were flown first to Bethel, a regional hub of 6,000 people. But authorities sought to relocate them as shelters there approached capacity. Stone and his family spent several nights sleeping on the floor of the Kipnuk school library before being flown to Bethel and then on to Anchorage, about 500 miles east of the villages. They arrived strapped into the floor of a huge military transport plane with hundreds of other evacuees.",
      "Another military plane carrying evacuees was due to arrive at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on Thursday evening.",
      "The hardest-hit communities, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, saw water levels more than 6 feet above the highest normal tide line. Some 121 homes were destroyed in Kipnuk, a village of about 700 people, and in Kwigillingok, three dozen homes drifted away.",
      "Cellphone service had been restored in Kwigillingok by Thursday, authorities said, and restrooms were again working at the school there, where about 350 people had sheltered overnight Tuesday.",
      "Damage was also serious in other villages. Water, sewer and well systems were inoperable in Napaskiak, according to a statement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state emergency management office, said he did not know how long the evacuation would take and said authorities were looking for additional shelters. The aim is to get people from congregate shelters into hotel rooms or dormitories, he said.",
      "Fisher also told CBS News Thursday that, while some of the flooding hit a record level, the weather forecasting was accurate, and they received the normal weather predictions and had the right data, regardless of\u00a0the reported cuts to weather balloons\u00a0or other projects.",
      "Fisher said cuts to public radio and TV did not affect communication. He acknowledged that communication was hampered after the storm, but Alaska's KYUK and KOTZ, two public radio stations, were up and broadcasting.",
      "While still in Kipnuk, Stone spent his days trying to help out, he said. He would make trips to the airport to pick up water or food that had been sent by other villages, and deliver it to the school. He worked to help rebuild the boardwalks on which residents get around. And when he had time, he would return to his battered house, trying to clean up some of the waterlogged clothing and electronics the floodwaters had tossed about.",
      "But the damage is extensive. Fuel and stove oil leaked from tanks, and the odor of petroleum permeates the entire town, he said. Like other villagers in the region, his family lost stores of food intended to help them get through the winter \u2014 the refrigerator and three freezers full of halibut, salmon, moose and goose.",
      "Stone's mother, Julia Stone, is a village police officer in Kipnuk. She was working at the school last weekend when the winds suddenly picked up, people suddenly began arriving at the building, and her on-call police cellphone begin ringing with calls from people in need \u2013 some reporting that their houses were floating.",
      "She tried to reach search and rescue teams and others to determine if there were available boats to help, but the situation was \"chaos,\" she said.",
      "Her voice broke during an interview Thursday in Anchorage as she thanked those at the school who helped with the response. \"It's a nightmare what we went through, but I thank God we are together,\" she said.",
      "Stone said he evacuated with the clothes on his back. Most of the rest of what he owned was soaked and reeked of fuel. The Red Cross provided cots, blankets and hygiene supplies in Anchorage, he said, and he went out to a thrift store on Thursday to get more clothes: two shirts, a sweater, two pairs of pants, and tennis shoes.",
      "He is not sure when it might be safe to return to Kipnuk.",
      "\"Everybody here that came from Kipnuk, they're pretty strong,\" Stone said. \"If we have to start over, we have to start over.\""

    "summary": "Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones squared off over a set of violent and incendiary text messages\u200b sent by Jones.",
    "story": [
      "Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones squared off in their first and only debate Thursday over a set of violent and incendiary text messages sent by Jones \u2014 an issue that has overtaken the race and vaulted it to national prominence.",
      "Miyares, an incumbent running for reelection, pushed hard against Jones for the leaked texts, which included messages to a Republican delegate in which Jones said that former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get \"two bullets to the head.\"",
      "Referencing a quote from President Abraham Lincoln, Miyares started the debate by saying: \"Character is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he (Jones) was doing in the dark.\"",
      "Jones apologized for his words from the start.",
      "\"Let me be very clear,\" he said. \"I am ashamed, I am embarrassed and I'm sorry.\"",
      "Still, the Democrat rebuffed Miyares by noting that violent rhetoric can be heard on both sides of the aisle, and that President Trump has been known to use extreme language at times.",
      "\"What about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?\" Jones said, adding, \"You haven't said a word. I've taken accountability for my mistakes. It's time you take accountability, too.\"",
      "The race for Virginia attorney general has emerged as one of the most competitive statewide contests in this year's election, with members of both parties taking an interest in the down-ballot race.",
      "While Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has faced setbacks in her race for governor, as has John Reid, the GOP lieutenant governor nominee, the attorney general's race remains fiercely competitive. Last week, it spilled over into the governor's race when former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, refused to say during a debate whether she still supported Jones' candidacy, suggesting it was up to the voters to decide.",
      "Jones and Miyares tangled over the violent text message for much of the debate. The way Miyares told it, Jones' texts about shooting a prominent Republican disqualified him from the race to be Virginia's lead prosecutor. Miyares also hit Jones over a reported\u00a02022 reckless driving conviction.",
      "\"Jay, if you were to apply to be a line prosecutor ... you would not pass a background check,\" Miyares said.",
      "Asked by a moderator how voters can trust him, Jones acknowledged that he \"made very great mistakes\" but was held accountable for them.",
      "Jones, in turn, spent much of his time arguing that Miyares lacked the nerve to sue the White House if the Trump administration overreached, saying Miyares \"won't hold the president accountable.\"",
      "\"Jason hangs out with Donald Trump at MAGA rallies,\" Jones said. \"I will see Jason Miyares and Donald Trump in court as your next attorney general.\"",
      "The candidates tackled other legal matters likely to involve the attorney general's office, including the enforcement of Virginia's clean energy law and the scope of Virginia's Human Rights Act, a state law prohibiting discrimination.",
      "Miyares and Jones also exchanged jabs on which candidate would do a better job of keeping Virginians safe. Miyares argued that Jones lacked the experience to hold criminals to account, citing a story by The Richmond Times-Dispatch of a Virginia state trooper clocking Jones speeding 116 miles per hour, leading to a reckless driving conviction.",
      "Jones, for his part, touted his record serving as a delegate in the Virginia House, where he said he supported legislation cracking down on sex offenders and human trafficking. He also referenced his experience going after ghost gun manufacturers while working in the attorney general's office for the District of Columbia.",
      "At one point, a moderator from the Virginia State Bar asked the candidates how they viewed the attorney general's office \u2014 as a political or legal one.",
      "\"It's clearly a legal one, and that's exactly why we have to hold the president accountable, go after Donald Trump and the bad actions of this administration,\" Jones eagerly responded.",
      "Miyares side-stepped the question, saying it's an office there to protect Virginians.",
      "\"Jay Jones wants fights in Washington,\" he said. \"He's running for the wrong office.\""

    "summary": "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager had said.",
    "story": [
      "Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, died on Thursday, his family and agent said. He was 74.",
      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall, his agent told The Associated Press.",
      "Family members said in a statement to AP that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken\" but will cherish his laughter and celebrate the kindness he bestowed upon others.",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",
      "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager, John Ostrosky, also known as John Ostronomy, said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0last month addressed to fans. Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",
      "In 2024, the band sold its catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be more than $300 million."

    "story": [
      "One of the most significant airlifts in Alaska history was underway Wednesday to move hundreds of people from coastal villages ravaged by high surf and strong winds from the remnants of Typhoon Halong last weekend, officials said.",
      "The storm brought record water levels to two low-lying communities and washed away homes \u2014 some with people inside. Makeshift shelters were quickly established and swelled to about 1,500 people, an extraordinary number in a sparsely populated region where communities are reachable by air or water.",
      "Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson for the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told CBS News by phone that one person was rescued and two remained missing after a home was washed out to sea.",
      "\"There were homes washed out to sea, and unfortunately, there was one home which was occupied and three people were washed out,\" Zidek told CBS News. \"One person has been recovered, and two persons are still missing. That's the most devastating impact. But we have communities all along the coast of Alaska that have been impacted.\"",
      "About 300 evacuees were being brought to Anchorage on Wednesday, about 500 miles east of the battered coastline villages, according to the state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. Zidek said some evacuees were being received at a temporary shelter set up at the Alaska Airlines Center, an arena in Anchorage.",
      "The remoteness and the scale of the destruction created challenges for getting resources in place. Damage assessments have been trickling in as responders have shifted from initial search-and-rescue operations to trying to stabilize or restore basic services.",
      "\"The storm struck on Saturday evening,\" Zidek told CBS News. \"I believe by Sunday morning the Alaska National Guard and the Alaska State Troopers launched aircraft to get into the communities and perform rescues, and they were literally plucking people off of roofs, going into homes, helping people wade out of the water, and lifting them in baskets and getting them to safety.\"",
      "Bryan Fisher, the director of the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told CBS News on Thursday that this was one of the largest disasters the state has ever dealt with.",
      "The communities of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok near the Bering Sea saw water levels more than 6 feet above the highest normal tide line.",
      "Some homes cannot be reoccupied, even with emergency repairs, and others may not be livable by winter, said emergency management officials. Forecasters say rain and snow is possible in the region this weekend, with average temperatures soon below freezing.",
      "Mark Roberts, the incident commander with the state emergency management agency, said the immediate focus was on \"making sure people are safe, warm and cared for while we work with our partners to restore essential services.\"",
      "Meantime, restrooms were again working at the school in Kwigillingok, where about 350 people had sheltered overnight Tuesday, according to a state emergency management statement.",
      "\"Damage to many homes is severe, and the community leadership is instructing residents not to reenter homes due to safety concerns,\" it said.",
      "Shelter space closer to home \u2014 in the southwest Alaska regional hub of Bethel \u2014 had been reaching capacity, officials said.",
      "Zidek did not know how long the evacuation process would take and said authorities were looking for additional sheltering locations. The aim is to get people from congregate shelters into hotel rooms or dormitories, he said.",
      "\"I'd like to note that these communities are extremely remote,\" Zidek told CBS News. \"There are no roads to any of them. The only reliable way to get in and out of them on a regular basis is by air and sometimes storms like the ones that impacted these communities make it impossible to reach them for long periods of time.\"",
      "Fisher said Thursday, \"Every coastal storm we get are as strong as hurricanes in the Southeast, but it's impossible to consider coastal-wide evacuation.\"",
      "He estimated that between 1,500 to 2,000 miles of Alaska's coastline was impacted by the storm, and said it would have been impossible for the state to evacuate everyone along that stretch of coast.",
      "\"This is our Hurricane Katrina, but without roads, and winter is right around the corner,\" Fisher said. 'We'll be dealing with this and caring for Alaskans throughout the entire winter before we can restore critical infrastructure and homes. This will be a very long-term situation before we can get people back to their homes.\"",
      "He said people are being evacuated some 300 to 500 miles away from their homes. Many of the impacted communities are not connected by roads. Many of the local runways have been damaged, so only small planes can fly in with needed supplies, he added.",
      "The crisis unfolding in southwest Alaska has drawn attention to Trump administration cuts to grants aimed at helping small, mostly Indigenous villages prepare for storms or mitigate disaster risks.",
      "For example, a $20 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant to Kipnuk, which was inundated by floodwaters, was terminated by the Trump administration, a move challenged by environmental groups. The grant was intended to protect to protect the boardwalk residents use to get around the community as well as 1,400 feet of river from erosion, according to a federal website that tracks government spending.",
      "There was limited work on the project before the grant was ended. The village had purchased a bulldozer for shipment and briefly hired a bookkeeper, according to Public Rights Project, which represents Kipnuk.",
      "The group said no single project was likely to prevent the recent flood. But work to remove abandoned fuel tanks and other material to prevent it from falling into the river might have been feasible during the 2025 construction season.",
      "\"What's happening in Kipnuk shows the real cost of pulling back support that was already promised to front line communities,\" said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project. \"These grants were designed to help local governments prepare for and adapt to the growing effects of climate change. When that commitment is broken, it puts people's safety, homes and futures at risk.\"",
      "Fisher said that, while some of the flooding was record-level, the weather forecasting was accurate, and they received the normal weather predictions and had the right data, regardless of the reported cuts to weather balloons or other projects.",
      "Fisher also said cuts to public radio and TV did not affect communication. He acknowledged that communication was hampered after the storm, but Alaska's KYUK and KOTZ, two public radio stations, were up and broadcasting."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military flew three B-52 bombers on missions near the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday, according to a Global Strike Command spokesperson and a U.S. official, as the Trump administration continues to exert pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.",
      "Tracking data on the site Flightradar24 shows the planes circled in the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday, flying about 150 miles north of Venezuela. The data was first reported by ABC News.",
      "The B-52 is a long-range bomber capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, according to the Air Force. It was used extensively in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "The mission follows a monthslong uptick in military activity in the waters off Venezuela. President Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the area. In sum, about 10,000 U.S. forces are built up in the Caribbean region, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, CBS News learned Wednesday.",
      "The military has also carried out airstrikes on at least five alleged drug-carrying boats near Venezuela since last month.

      "Tensions have spiked between the U.S. and Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of collaborating with cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua.

      "Maduro has denied ties to drug cartels and lashed out at the Trump administration for its strikes on alleged drug boats, accusing it of plotting regime change. Mr. Trump has not publicly said he is seeking the ouster of Maduro, whose 2018 and 2024 election victories were marred by widespread allegations of fraud.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton was indicted in Maryland on Thursday for allegedly mishandling classified information by sharing diary entries about his time in the White House with family members.",
      "Bolton is the third prominent Trump critic to be indicted in recent weeks, following charges against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress and New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. All three have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Bolton indictment, Mr. Trump said he was not aware of it, but said: \"I think he's a bad guy.\"",
      "In a statement, Bolton said he has \"become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department,\" and argued that Mr. Trump \"embodies what Joseph Stalin's head of secret police once said, 'You show me the man, and I'll show you the crime.'\"",
      "\"I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power,\" Bolton wrote.",
      "Bolton was charged in the 26-page indictment with 18 criminal counts, including eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining national defense information.",
      "The indictment alleges he \"abused his position as National Security Advisor by sharing more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities\" with two unnamed relatives, including material that had a top secret classification.",
      "It says he sent \"diary-like entries\" to the two people using a nongovernmental email, \"such as email accounts hosted by AOL and Google.\" Those entries allegedly included classified information up to the top secret and sensitive compartmented information level, a designation that means it was derived from sensitive intelligence sources.",
      "Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, denied that Bolton illegally shared or retained information.",
      "\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career \u2013 records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said in a statement Thursday. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries \u2013 that is not a crime.\"",
      "At some point between 2019 and 2021, the indictment says, Bolton's email account was hacked by a \"cyber actor\" believed to be linked to Iran. It alleges that Bolton told federal officials about the hack but didn't say that his account had been used to send classified information, or that he had shared this material with two relatives.",
      "The charges say Bolton received a haunting email about the hack in 2021, warning, \"I do not think you would be interested in the FBI being aware of the leaked content of John's email\" and calling it \"the biggest scandal since Hillary's emails were leaked.\"",
      "Bolton is also accused in the indictment of printing out some of the documents with national defense information and storing them at his home in Montgomery County, Maryland. Prosecutors allege some of this information was also saved and stored on personal electronic devices used by Bolton and others in his personal residence.",
      "The indictment says printouts of the diary entries \u2014 and electronic files showing he sent the messages \u2014 were found in Bolton's home and office during an FBI search in August. According to unsealed court papers, agents found records marked classified during the searches.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement after the indictment was handed down: \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\"",
      "What information is Bolton accused of mishandling?",
      "The diary entries allegedly included \"detailed information that BOLTON learned from meetings with senior members of the U.S. Government, intelligence briefings from members of the intelligence community and military, discussions with foreign leaders and foreign intelligence and military organizations, and intelligence products and reports.\"",
      "The indictment outlines the types of information Bolton is accused of unlawfully retaining and sharing. It includes intelligence on attacks by an adversarial group in another country, intelligence that a foreign government was planning a missile launch in the future, covert actions planned by the U.S. and intelligence about what foreign governments knew about a planned attack against the U.S.",
      "In some cases, the indictment says, Bolton and his relatives traded observations about the diary entries. \"Stuff coming to cheer you... up!!!\" Bolton allegedly wrote in one message affixed to a 20-page document.",
      "Bolton has faced years of scrutiny over classified info",
      "Mr. Trump has had a rocky relationship with Bolton since he left his post as national security adviser in 2019 amid disagreements over Middle East policy. At the time, Bolton said he offered his resignation, but Mr. Trump said he asked Bolton to resign.",
      "Bolton then wrote a book about his tenure \u2014 \"The Room Where It Happened\" \u2014 that portrayed the president in an unflattering light. Mr. Trump claimed that Bolton \"illegally released much Classified Information\" in his book, calling him \"a lowlife who should be in jail.\"",
      "None of the classified information that led to Thursday's charges was published in the book, the indictment says.",
      "The first Trump administration tried to stop the publication of the book and later sued him for the profits, arguing it contained classified information. The Justice Department opened a criminal inquiry into whether Bolton had published classified information, claiming he had failed to complete a prepublication review \u2014 which Bolton has denied.",
      "In a late September event at the Harvard Kennedy School, Bolton said, \"I'm very confident that there's nothing in the book that's classified. That's why there was a prepublication review.\"",
      "In June 2020, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth denied the Justice Department's effort to stop the publication of Bolton's book, but after reviewing the classified materials at issue, said in his ruling that Bolton \"likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.\"",
      "\"Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States,\" Lamberth wrote. \"He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability.\"",
      "DOJ charges a third Trump foe",
      "The charges against Bolton came after a different prosecutor's office \u2014 the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia \u2014 brought criminal charges against Comey and James, who have also drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years. They have denied all wrongdoing and argued the charges against them are driven by politics.",
      "The Trump administration has lashed out at Bolton in the past. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's second inauguration, his administration removed Bolton's Secret Service protection. Bolton had been granted the protection by the Biden administration in December 2021, after a series of threats from Iran that were linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure. That strike resulted in the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.",
      "The charges against Bolton also follow investigations into Mr. Trump and former President Joe Biden after classified documents were allegedly found in their homes.",
      "In Mr. Trump's case, the Justice Department brought criminal charges in 2023 accusing the then-former president of mishandling sensitive documents and conspiring to obstruct justice. The charges were later dismissed after a federal judge found a Justice Department special counsel had been unlawfully appointed.",
      "And in Biden's case, a special counsel found he \"willfully\" retained classified documents, but decided no criminal charges were warranted."

Almost simultaneously, the driver and husband gets pulled out of the car with a gun into his waist.\"",
      "However, after entering the garage, the house alarm was triggered, prompting the two suspects to flee, the sheriff's office said. The AirTag was later found by investigators taped beneath the vehicle.",
      "Deputies arrested 26-year-old Luis Charles in Tampa on Oct. 8, and, two days later, 32-year-old Omardy Maldonado-Rodriguez was apprehended in Pasco County, where Odessa is located, the sheriff's office said. Both were booked on charges including armed kidnapping and armed burglary.",
      "Maurer said that while the AirTag allowed the suspects to track their victims, it also helped investigators track the suspects because \"they used their name to purchase\" the AirTag, he alleged.",

      "The three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit said in a unanimous decision that \"the facts do not justify\" Mr. Trump's actions in Illinois under the section of federal law known as\u00a0Title 10, which the president has invoked to federalize National Guard troops to protect federal immigration personnel and government facilities in several cities.",
      "Over the weekend, the 7th Circuit issued a preliminary order that temporarily\u00a0blocked the deployment of Guard troops within Illinois, but allowed them to remain under federal control.

    "story": [
      "Americans receive tens of millions of unsolicited automated calls and texts each day, often intended to dupe them into forking over personal information or money.",
      "That's the thrust of a new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization, which found that scam and telemarketing calls and texts have proliferated across the country, despite safeguards intended to prevent them. (Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

      "President Trump announced the strike Tuesday in a\u00a0post on Truth Social, saying the vessel had been \"just off the Coast of Venezuela\" and was \"transiting along a known designated terrorist organization\" route. Mr. Trump said intelligence confirmed that the boat was trafficking narcotics and referred to the men aboard as \"narcoterrorists,\" but offered no other information.",
      "This was the fifth such strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean. Figures released by the administration say 27 people have been killed in the strikes.",
      "The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service said it was \"aware of the reports\" that citizens of the country, which lies less than 10 miles off the coast Venezuela, had been on the vessel. Police said they are conducting inquiries, but said that the information \"is yet to be fully verified through official channels\" and said they could not confirm any details. The agency said a statement would be released once information was verified, and asked for \"patience and understanding\" amid \"this complex situation.\"",
      "Police said in a phone interview with Agence France-Presse   that residents of the village of Las Cuevas reported two Trinidadians were believed to be on the sunken vessel.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have been expressing growing concern about the strikes and frustration with the lack of information from the White House as to their intent. Some Republicans are seeking more details from the White House on the legal justification for the actions, while Democrats contend they violate U.S. and international law. A war powers resolution\u00a0that would have barred\u00a0the Trump administration from conducting the strikes without Congressional authorization failed to pass the Senate last week.",
      "The strikes come amid rising tensions with Venezuela. Mr. Trump told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe on Wednesday that he had authorized the CIA to\u00a0conduct covert operations\u00a0in the country. The president also said his administration is looking into\u00a0potential land strikes\u00a0against Venezuela. There has been a major build-up of U.S. forces the region in recent weeks. The U.S. Justice Department in August doubled a bounty for information leading to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's capture to\u00a0$50 million.",
      "Maduro\u00a0has accused Washington of plotting regime change,\u00a0CBS News previously reported, and has called recent U.S.' actions \"aggression\", following up by ordering new military exercises on Wednesday. \u00a0He is widely accused of winning re-election last year through fraud and Mr. Trump alleges that he is the head of a drug cartel, which the Venezuelan leader denies."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 09:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Advocacy group The Trevor Projected released data from the first year of a study following more than 1,600 LGBTQ+ youth across the country.",
    "story": [
      "Mental health distress among LGBTQ+ youth in the United States has been increasing amid a surge in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, but strong support networks and access to health care were shown to ease symptoms for some, a study found.",
      "The findings were published Thursday by The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization that provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services. Researchers followed 1,689 LGBTQ+ young people between the ages of 13 and 24 between September 2023 and March 2025.",
      "The study is the first to follow a sample of LGBTQ+ young people over an extended period of time, said Ronita Nath, vice president of research for The Trevor Project.",
      "\"We know that LGBTQ+ youth are at a significantly higher suicide risk than their cisgender heterosexual peers, but most research only captures their experiences at one point in time, which really limits our understanding of how risk and protective factors play out over months or years,\" Nath told CBS News.",
      "The participants of the study were asked to complete a 139 question survey about a range of risk and protective factors on three separate occasions between six month intervals.",
      "Researchers found mental health distress increased substantially throughout the study's first year. LGBTQ+ youth reporting recent anxiety symptoms rose from 57% to 68%. Those reporting depressive symptoms climbed from 48% to 54%. Suicidal ideation among LGBTQ+ youth grew from 41% to 47%, the data shows.",
      "The findings show how experiencing discrimination or support preceded changes in mental health, suggesting they drive rather than coincide with negative or positive health outcomes, Nath said.",
      "Trevor Project data shows living in an LGBTQ+-affirming home was linked to 37% lower odds of suicidal thoughts. Receiving high support from family was associated with 62% lower odds of suicidal ideation when controlled for age, sexual orientation, gender identity and race/ethnicity.",
      "Data also indicates conversion therapy, or attempts to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, remains a harmful experience for LGBTQ+ youth contributing to mental health distress.",
      "\"While we may think it's a relic of the past, this data indicates that these dangerous practices are still happening and actually may be on the rise,\" Nath said.",
      "Reports of being threatened with conversion therapy doubled in the first year of the study, and exposure to the practice rose from 9% to 15% among participants.",
      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging a Colorado law banning conversion therapy treatments for minors. Colorado is one of at least 20 states that prohibit mental health professionals from engaging in any practice, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "Transgender and nonbinary youth between ages 13 and 17 reported the poorest mental health outcomes. They were twice as likely to report anxiety and suicidal ideation compared to their cisgender peers, a pattern that persisted over the course of the study.",
      "Legislation restricting legal and medical protections for transgender and nonbinary youth may be contributing to the worsening outcomes, Nath said.",
      "\"Access to medical, legal, and social supports for gender transition, which includes hormones, puberty blockers, accurate identification documents contributed to improved mental health among transgender and nonbinary youth, which I think highlights the potential harm created by legislation reducing access to transgender health care,\" she said.",
      "The ACLU is tracking at least 25 laws passed across the U.S. to limit access to affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "While mental health outcomes worsened, suicide attempts among the LGBTQ+ youth surveyed declined from 11% to 7%. Still, that rate remains higher than national estimates for cisgender heterosexual youth.",
      "\"LGBTQ+ young people are not inherently prone to higher suicide risk, but that, they're placed at higher suicide risk because of how they're stigmatized and denied support,\" said Nath.",
      "Nath emphasized the overarching takeaway from the study is how support from family and community can affect the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth.",
      "\"Across all our analysis, supportive family environments, accepting friends, and greater cumulative family support actions all reduce the likelihood of later anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, which really does echo decades of research on the protective power of family acceptance,\" she said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can connect to a crisis counselor at The Trevor Project by texting \"START\" to 678-678 or calling 1-866-488-7386.",
      "For more information about mental health care resources and support, The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) HelpLine can be reached Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. ET, at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) or email info@nami.org."

      "Mike Waltz, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday that American personnel would be part of the effort to recover the remains of the 19 hostages that have yet to be turned over.",
      "Hamas returned the bodies of two more deceased Israeli hostages Wednesday night, bringing the total number returned to nine. But as video continued to emerge showing the staggering scale of destruction in Gaza, the group said it couldn't hand over any more remains without specialized equipment to find and retrieve the bodies.",
      "Israeli soldier Capt. Daniel Peretz was among the former hostages laid to rest in solemn ceremonies on Wednesday after his family finally received his body, which was held in Gaza for over two years. Peretz was killed fighting Hamas during the attack on Oct. 7, 2023. For his family, the day brought fresh pain.",
      "\"It's a new truth I have to face,\" said his sister Adina Peretz. \"It's proof, proof, that you are really gone.\"",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents Israeli hostage families, said this week that the peace process should not move forward until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, in a social media post on Monday, called Hamas' initial handover of only four bodies \"a violation of the agreement,\" adding that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.\"",
      "But senior U.S. advisers speaking to reporters on Wednesday in Washington urged patience, citing the difficulties in retrieving the remains. They said U.S. officials were not at a point where they believed the peace agreement had been violated by either side.",
      "\"Many of the Hamas commanders who are responsible for burying these Israeli hostages are no longer alive,\" Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News on Wednesday. \"They were killed by the Israelis.\"",
      "Given that fact, and the perilous conditions inside the Palestinian territory, where there are unexploded bombs amid the piles of debris, Baskin said \"some of the deceased hostages may never be found, and that's part of the reality, but we have to make sure that Hamas is doing everything possible to do it.\"",
      "President Trump weighed in on the matter himself on Wednesday, telling reporters the recovery efforts \u2014 which international search and rescue experts are expected to join at some point \u2014 were \"a gruesome process.\"",
      "\"I almost hate to talk about it,\" said Mr. Trump. \"But they're digging. They're actually digging, areas where they're digging, and they're finding a lot of bodies. Then they have to separate the bodies.\"",

So, they need heavy equipment. They need specialized gear. But we have to also understand that if this ceasefire falls apart, the fighting starts, that's going to make it that much harder to find these loved ones and get them out.\"",

No firm plans for such a deployment, from Turkey or any other nation, have been confirmed, but Turkish media said 81 personnel from that country alone could be sent to the region, including ten-person specialist search and rescue units.",
      "Israel said it would return the bodies of 15 Palestinians in exchange for the remains of every hostage handed back by Hamas as part of the peace deal, and the Red Cross has been transferring remains of Palestinians back to Gaza in recent days. But those returns, too, have been mired in controversy.",
      "\"We saw with our own eyes clear signs of torture and execution,\" Sameh Hamad, a member of a commission tasked with receiving the bodies at a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, told The Associated Press. \"Their hands and feet were cuffed, their eyes blindfolded.\"",

      "The European Union's top court ruled Thursday that a dog traveling in an airplane's cargo hold counts as baggage, meaning airlines are not required to pay higher compensation if the animal is lost.",
      "The ruling stems from a dispute between Spanish airline Iberia and a passenger whose dog, Mona, went missing before a flight from Buenos Aires to Barcelona in October 2019.",
      "The dog, which had to travel in a pet carrier in the aircraft's hold due to its size and weight, escaped while being taken to the plane and was never seen again.",

      "\"Very disappointed\"",
      "The company accepted responsibility but argued that compensation should be limited to the lower amount set for checked baggage under the Montreal Convention, an international agreement that covers airline liability.",

In sum, about 10,000 U.S. forces are built up in the Caribbean region, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, CBS News learned Wednesday.",

Maduro was indicted in Manhattan for narco-terrorism five years ago, and the administration increased the bounty for his capture to $50 million earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In 2018, the FDA finally began testing talcum powder and other related products for asbestos. A year later, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew a batch of its powder after the FDA found asbestos fibers in a sample.",
      "The U.K. claims will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury, at the U.K. High Court's Manchester Circuit Commercial Court.",
      "In a statement, Kenvue said it believes the judge will find that its talc-based powder did not cause cancer.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the attribution of the statement from Kenvue Ltd. to BBC News and to note that it is a separate company from J&J, not a subsidiary."

      "Mr. Trump also said in a social media post last month that Ukraine's forces were \"in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,\" with Europe's help \u2013 surprising Zelenskyy. Mr. Trump previously said that \"some swapping of territories\" might be necessary for a ceasefire.",
      "Ukrainian officials have been quick to try to capitalize on the Trump administration's change in tone.",
      "On Monday, Zelenskyy congratulated Mr. Trump on his Gaza peace plan in a social media post, adding: \"We are working so that the day of peace comes for Ukraine as well. Russian aggression remains the last global source of destabilization, and if a ceasefire and peace have been achieved for the Middle East, the leadership and determination of global actors can certainly work for us, too.\"",
      "On Thursday, meanwhile, the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv renamed a town square after Mr. Trump, with the local administration voicing hope that, \"it will be Donald Trump who manages to make efforts to stop another major war \u2026 We believe that for this he could rightfully become a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\"",
      "\"I don't know why he continues with this war\"",
      "Ukrainian officials have been in Washington, D.C., this week for bilateral discussions with U.S. counterparts, in an effort to cement the administration's sympathies with Ukraine.",
      "Ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump has said he is considering selling Tomahawk long-range missiles to Kyiv. Zelenskyy has long sought the missiles, which could reach Moscow. Putin has called any U.S. transfer of such weapons a red line.",
      "A White House official said they were to discuss the Tomahawk issue in a phone call Thursday, but the president didn't mention it in his social media about the call after it happened.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week that he had told Zelenskyy he might give Putin an ultimatum: Hold serious peace talks, or Kyiv will get Tomahawks.",
      "Russia has continued its deadly bombing attacks on Ukrainian civilians and targeting of the country's energy infrastructure in the meantime.",
      "Asked Tuesday about the meeting with Zelenskyy and the grinding, three-year war, Mr. Trump seemed at pains to explain Putin's desire to keep fighting.",
      "\"Vladimir and I had a good relationship, probably still do,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I don't know why he continues with this war \u2026 He just doesn't want to end that war.\""

      "Former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan on Thursday appealed his extradition from Australia to the United States over allegations that he illegally trained Chinese military aviators more than a decade ago.",
      "Duggan is accused of training Chinese military pilots while working as an instructor for the Test Flying Academy of South Africa in 2012. He appeared at the court in Canberra to file the appeal with his attorney after traveling 218 miles from a prison in Wellington, New South Wales state.",

    "summary": "Netanyahu discussed the Gaza peace plan and defended Israel's actions in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's prepared to \"give peace a chance\" \u2014 but \"the way you purchase peace is through strength,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil Tuesday in Tel Aviv.",
      "Netanyahu spoke to CBS News days after Hamas released the last 20 living hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel's military withdrew from parts of the Gaza Strip, in the first phase of a peace plan brokered by President Trump and Arab states. He weighed in on the future of Gaza, how Israel will react if Hamas doesn't disarm and the criticism Israel has faced during the war.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Could Netanyahu regret releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli hostages?",
      "Netanyahu took a longer view when Dokoupil, in reference to the release of almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in exchange for both the living and deceased Israeli hostages, asked him, \"Are you going to regret this decision?\"",
      "He responded that now, Israel is in a \"much better position\" to pursue Hamas if it fails to abide by the peace plan because there are no longer 20 Israeli hostages \"with their head on the chopping block.\"",
      "Dokoupil noted that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, was released in an exchange with Israel in 2011.",
      "Netanyahu acknowledged that the decision to release thousands of people \u2014 including 250 who were serving life sentences in Israeli prisons \u2014 was \"very painful.\"",
      "\"It's true that the worst ones among them we didn't release, but that's small comfort if your son or daughter was murdered by one of these people who were freed,\" he said.",
      "Releasing the Palestinian prisoners came with the understanding that \"there's an enormous price to pay for the commitment that Israel has to bring our hostages or captives held by the enemy,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu claims ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza is \"less than 2 to 1\"",
      "Asked by Dokoupil about the criticism that he's been \"negligent with civilian life in Gaza\" and whether his count of civilian deaths differed from that of the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, Netanyahu estimated \"20,000 Hamas terrorists\" had been killed by Israel.",
      "He added that that was the number \"if you take away the people who die anyway from disease or old age.\"",
      "Netanyahu argued, \"Take away the double counting and so on, the ratio is less than 2 to 1, which is unbelievable in urban conflict.\" It's a figure he also cited at the United Nations General Assembly in September, telling world leaders, \"The ratio of non-combatant to combatant casualties is less than 2 to 1 in Gaza.\"",
      "The Gaza Ministry of Health says nearly 70,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023. Its numbers do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. There are also an estimated 11,000 Gazans still missing, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, presumed to be buried beneath the rubble.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday that he believes roughly 60,000 people have died in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu says finishing war \"as speedily as possible\" is \"first fix\" to combat young Americans' negative views of Israel",
      "Netanyahu cited the war's duration as one of the reasons that Americans' have an increasingly negative view of Israel. A Pew poll in late September found only 35% of the respondents had a positive opinion of Israel's government, down from 47% in 2022, before the war started. Among Americans under 30, only 13% said the U.S. was providing \"about the right amount of aid to Israel.\"",
      "\"The first fix is to finish the war as speedily as possible, something that I have sought to do against all this contrarian propaganda,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also blamed social media for fueling the outrage against Israel, saying that \"lies\" about the nation \"obviously does its damage.\"",
      "\"In the TikTok age and in the television age \u2026 letting wars go on too long is going to cost you precisely what it costs you.\" But he added, \"That can recover at least partly when you finish the war and you move on to what I hope will be the era of peace.\"",
      "Netanyahu on Trump saying he's hard to work with: \"I'm very tough\"",
      "In remarks to the Knesset on Monday, Mr. Trump said Netanyahu is \"not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"",
      "Netanyahu appeared to take pride in the characterization.",
      "\"I hope he says that, because I'm very tough on the matters that pertain to my country's future,\" he told Dokoupil. \"My job is to protect the Jewish state and assure the future of the Jewish people.\"",
      "Netanyahu says Hamas must disarm or \"all hell breaks loose\"",
      "\"We agreed to give peace a chance,\" Netanyahu said. But he also maintained that the conditions in Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza are \"very clear:\" Hamas must give up its arms and demilitarize, or \"all hell breaks loose.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"We will disarm them.\"",
      "\"And it'll happen quickly and perhaps violently,\" the president said. \"But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu told Dokoupil, \"I hope we can do this peacefully. We're certainly ready to do so.\"",
      "How will the Gaza Strip be governed?",
      "A major unresolved question is who will control the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces withdraw.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan calls for control over the territory to be handed over to a technocratic committee made up of Palestinians, overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" that includes Mr. Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Hamas is not supposed to play any role in governance. But beyond that, it's unclear.",
      "Netanyahu said the exact structure for how the territory will be run is unsettled.",
      "Asked by Dokoupil if Blair would run Gaza himself, Netanyahu replied, \"I doubt it.\"",
      "\"But I think that this is a transitional period, and we want to fashion a governance that works, that is not made of people who are committed to our destruction,\" he said. \"We don't want to have the October 7th massacre repeated.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out the idea of allowing an independent Palestinian state, the solution that has been advocated by U.S. allies in Europe and the Arab world.",
      "He told Dokoupil that he supports Palestinians having the power to govern themselves, but would not support a Palestinian state with \"military power.\" \"That sovereign power of security must remain with Israel,\" the prime minister continued.",
      "The Israeli leader said the path forward should involve deradicalization and changes to the Palestinian education system. He also noted that many Gazans are opposed to Hamas or hold the group responsible for inflicting \"horrific misery\" on them.",
      "\"The most important thing in destroying fanaticism is to destroy a certain hope, the hope that the fanaticism will achieve its results,\" Netanyahu said. \"When people know Israel is here to stay, you're not going to destroy the Jewish state, Israel is too strong, that prepares the ground for a change of heart.\""

      "President Trump confirmed Wednesday that he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations.",
      "Asked by CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe why he did so, the president said he had two reasons: First, \"they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America\" and \"allowed thousands and thousands of prisoners\" and \"people from mental institutions, insane asylums\" into the U.S. Trump has frequently alleged \u2014 without citing evidence \u2014 that other countries are deliberately sending people from prisons and mental institutions to the southern border.",
      "He also cited the \"drugs coming in from Venezuela.\"",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in from the sea. You get to see that,\" he told reporters at the White House in what seemed to be a reference to his administration's military airstrikes against suspected drug traffickers in waters off the coast of Venezuela. \"But we're gonna stop them by land, also.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the president's authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela. Top Trump administration officials have accused Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of controlling the drug cartel Tren de Aragua, which Maduro denies, and the Justice Department has offered a reward for information leading to his capture. In August, the department doubled the bounty to\u00a0$50 million.",
      "Asked Wednesday whether the CIA had the authority to target Maduro, Mr. Trump said it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer,\" but \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat.\"",

      "On Tuesday, the president said that the U.S. had struck another small boat off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people. It was the fifth\u00a0such strike in the Caribbean, where the Trump administration has asserted its authority to treat alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who may be attacked with military force. At least 27 people have been killed in the five strikes, according to figures released by the administration.",
      "Mr. Trump has also deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the region as part of what he has said is as an operation to combat drug smuggling into the United States.",

      "After the U.S.' latest boat strike, Maduro\u00a0on Wednesday ordered military exercises in the country's biggest shantytowns.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug boats have drawn pushback from lawmakers in both parties. Critics note that Congress hasn't authorized military force against drug traffickers, and argue the Trump administration hasn't provided enough evidence about who was on the boats and what narcotics they were carrying.",
      "Asked by O'Keefe about those concerns, Mr. Trump said lawmakers \"are given information that they were loaded up with drugs, and that's the thing that matters.\" He alleged that \"fentanyl dust\" has been found on the boats after the strikes.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or Rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobisdashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rishiki from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rishiki competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimirate, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rishiki is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rishiki on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onasato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

      "A man accused of luring children worldwide into a sadistic online abuse network was charged by German prosecutors Wednesday with hundreds of crimes \u2014 including murder, for a 13-year-old American's livestreamed suicide.",
      "Using the pseudonym \"White Tiger,\" the 21-year-old Hamburg man, a German-Iranian national, allegedly victimized more than 30 children with online sexual abuse, manipulation and exploitation as a part of a virtual network of abusers known as \"764.\" In April, the network's leaders were arrested and charged for allegedly operating \"one of the most heinous online child exploitation enterprises\" officials have ever seen, according to the U.S. Justice Department.",

    "summary": "\"Life is a right, both in health and in sickness, but it should never be an obligation,\" one Uruguayan senator argued before the final vote to legalize the process.",
    "story": [
      "Uruguay's senate passed a law decriminalizing euthanasia on Wednesday, putting the South American nation among a handful of other countries where seriously ill patients can legally obtain help to end their lives.",
      "It makes Uruguay the first country in predominantly Catholic Latin America to allow euthanasia via legislation. Colombia and Ecuador have decriminalized the practice through Supreme Court decisions.",
      "In Chile, left-wing President Gabriel Boric recently revived a push for the approval of an euthanasia bill long stalled in the Senate.",
      "Fierce debates and spirited activism around the practice has gripped the region in recent years.",

      "U.K. lawmakers back medically assisted dying bill",
      "U.K. lawmakers back medically assisted dying bill",
      "The law, which moved forward in fits and starts over the last five years, cleared its final hurdle on Wednesday as 20 out of 31 senators voted in favor. The lower house approved the bill in August with a large majority. All that's left is for the government to implement the regulations.",
      "During the debate, senators from the ruling Broad Front coalition delivered impassioned defenses of the right to die, comparing the euthanasia movement to the legalization of divorce and same-sex marriage.",
      "\"We all believe and feel that life is a right, both in health and in sickness, but it should never be an obligation because others don't understand such unbearable suffering,\" Sen. Daniel Borbonet said, after quoting testimony from Uruguayan patients with irreversible medical conditions.",
      "Most opposition to euthanasia in Uruguay came from the Catholic Church. Before the vote, Daniel Sturla, the archbishop of Montevideo, called on Uruguayans \"to defend the gift of life and to remember that every person deserves to be cared for, accompanied and supported until the end.\"",
      "But secularization has eroded resistance to the practice in this country of 3.5 million people, which bans any mention of God in oaths of office and calls Christmas \"Family Day.\"",
      "Officials hailed the law's passage as reinforcing Uruguay's reputation as among the most socially liberal nations in the region. The country was first in the world to legalize marijuana for recreational use and passed pioneering legislation allowing same-sex marriage and abortion over a decade ago. Both laws were passed by secular, socially liberal former President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who died aged 89 in May.",
      "\"This is a historic event, which places Uruguay at the forefront in addressing deeply human and sensitive issues,\" said Vice President Carolina Cosse.",
      "The legislation permits euthanasia, performed by a health care professional, but not assisted dying, which involves a patient self-administering a lethal dose of prescribed medication.",
      "Unlike laws in U.S. states, Australia and New Zealand restricting assisted dying to those with a life expectancy of no more than six months or a year, Uruguay sets no time limits. It also does not require a waiting period, and allows anyone suffering from an incurable illness that causes \"unbearable suffering\" to seek assisted death, even if their diagnosis is not terminal.",
      "Uruguay requires those seeking euthanasia to be mentally competent.",
      "Although the law does not outright ban euthanasia for those with mental conditions like depression, it requires that patients get two doctors to rule that they are psychologically fit enough to make the decision.",
      "Unlike Belgium, Colombia and the Netherlands, Uruguay will not allow euthanasia for minors."

    "story": [
      "Hamas said Wednesday it has handed over all the Israeli hostage remains in Gaza that it has been able to recover, and that extensive efforts and special equipment are required to find the remaining bodies.",
      "The Red Cross said it received two more coffins containing the remains of deceased hostages, which were being transferred to Israeli authorities, the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli Security Agency said in a joint statement. The IDF said late Wednesday night local time that the coffins had entered Israel and were being taken to the National Centre for Forensic Medicine for identification.",
      "\"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages,\" the IDF said in a statement.",
      "The return of the hostages is a cornerstone of the Gaza peace plan, which called for Hamas to hand over all remaining hostages \u2014 20 living and 28 dead \u2014 by Monday, Oct. 13.",
      "Since the plan took effect last week, Hamas has been accused of delaying handing over the remains of Israeli hostages still believed to be in the Palestinian territory.",
      "While Hamas returned the 20 living hostages by the Monday deadline, the remains of only four deceased Israeli captives were handed over. Hamas transferred an additional four bodies on Tuesday, but the IDF said one of them was not a hostage. That means the remains of at least 19 hostages are still unaccounted for.",
      "A senior U.S. adviser told reporters on a call Wednesday that \"nobody is getting left behind,\" noting they believe there are still many bodies buried under the mountains of rubble across Gaza. Senior U.S. advisers said the level of destruction also makes it difficult to move around in the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"It would have been almost impossible for Hamas to mobilize, even if they knew where all the 28 bodies were, to mobilize and get them home,\" one adviser said.",
      "Strikingly, the adviser said that the U.S. is sharing Israeli intelligence with Hamas to assist in finding hostage remains. The adviser also said Turkey has offered to help search for and retrieve remains by sending in expert teams with experience rescuing people from the frequent earthquakes in the country.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a social media post on Monday that Hamas' initial return of only four bodies constituted \"a violation of the agreement\" and added that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.\"",
      "During negotiations that led to the deal, Hamas representatives said they did not know the location of all the remains of deceased hostages, according to Israeli media reports. President Trump also said in Egypt on Monday that not all of the bodies of the deceased hostages had been found, adding that unidentified parties were still \"working out\" how to locate an unspecified number of remains.",
      "Both the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the group that represents the hostage families, and Israel's defense minister have said the entire peace deal should be shelved until all of the hostages' remains are returned by Hamas.",
      "Senior U.S. advisers who spoke to reporters on Wednesday, citing the difficulties in retrieving the remains still in Gaza, urged patience and said they are not at a point where they feel that the agreement has been violated.",
      "Even if these issues are resolved, the 20-point peace plan still faces other considerable hurdles. Hamas wants the Israeli military \u2014 which still occupies more than half of Gaza \u2014 to withdraw entirely. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that the conditions of the plan \"are very clear \u2014 it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First, Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza.\"",
      "But Hamas has rejected calls to disarm, and, since the start of the ceasefire, CBS News' team in Gaza has seen Hamas back on the streets, still armed, and reportedly confronting rival groups. Mr. Trump on Tuesday warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"we will disarm them,\" adding: \"It'll happen quickly and perhaps violently. But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he heard Mr. Trump's remarks, paraphrasing them as \"all hell breaks loose.\"",
      "\"Well, I hope it doesn't,\" Netanyahu told Dokoupil. \"I hope we can do this peacefully. We're certainly ready to do so.\""

      "\"I had been very scared when I did not know what was happening to me, because I had no sense of whether tremendous pain was forthcoming,\" Curry wrote. \"But if death comes for me peacefully and I fade gently from light into dark oblivion, why would I be afraid of it? Sometimes, I rather think it would be a comfort.\"",
      "\"I can say that now, because it\u2019s been over a dozen years, which is a sufficient amount of time to be able to reflect back calmly, and perhaps with a healthy dose of disassociation,\" he wrote. \"At the time, if I\u2019m being honest, I was just astonished to be lying there.\"",

      "Curry remembered being told that he had experienced a right-sided paralytic stroke. Since the stroke occurred in the right hemisphere of his brain \u2014 the area responsible for motor control on the opposite side \u2014 it resulted in paralysis on the left side of his body.",
      "\"I don't know when the paralysis set in; initially it just felt very strange that the left side of my body had gone numb,\" Curry said.",
      "He wrote that he was transferred two days later to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where his longtime personal assistant and publicist Marcia Hurwitz helped him be admitted under an alias to protect his identity and prevent his stroke from being made public.",
      "\"After regaining consciousness, I could comprehend words but they did not register or settle without effort. Life was exceedingly dull, monotonous, and uncertain for a long while, Curry wrote. \"I was aware of where I was, but it took me a while to fully accept what had happened, as I imagine is the case with many people getting over a stroke and brain surgery.\"",
      "\"My skull had been smashed in to save my life,\" he continued. \"That\u2019s plenty to process. I needed the rest and slept a lot.\"",
      "Curry wrote that he spent months at the hospital before eventually entering a rehabilitation center \"where the real exercises began: to retrieve my ability to speak clearly, to work on smiling and facial expressions, and to try using my hand and adapting to my new normal.\"",
      "\"I was living in a fog. I looked frightful, and I couldn\u2019t speak clearly for ages. That part was exceptionally frustrating, because thoughts were forming again, but articulating them was such a monumental stretch,\" he recalled. \"I felt like there was a massive gulf between my mind and what emerged from my mouth.\"",
      "\"Half sentences here or there would make it, but it took a while \u2014 which amounted to a whole lot of time dwelling in my own head,\" Curry continued. \"Being unable to string together and clearly deliver a sentence was absolute misery for somebody who values words and conversation as much as I do.\"",

      "\"The Three Musketeers\" star also poked fun at rumors that he had died, writing, \"Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.\"",
      "\"I try to avoid complaining too much. (I prefer doing it just enough.) But I do have the material: as I write this I\u2019m confined to a wheelchair, having never managed to walk again,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Even so, whining is a f---ing bore for everybody involved\u2014and it\u2019s highly unproductive,\" Curry continued. \"I\u2019d rather spend my time focusing on other things.\"",
      "\"The different ways that people cope with pain is quite interesting,\" he added. \"I do not consider it an act of tremendous courage or bravery that I resort to humor in moments of great discomfort. It\u2019s just my go-to. I am sure it\u2019s partially a survival skill I developed a very long time ago, to the extent that humor can be developed.\"",

      "The email was sent three months after Prince Andrew told the BBC he had cut all communication with Epstein, who was found dead in his New York jail cell weeks after his 2019 arrest. The American financier was awaiting trial on U.S. federal sex-trafficking charges involving dozens of teenage girls and young women, some as young as 14. Investigators ruled his death a suicide.",

      "With just under three weeks until New Yorkers choose their next mayor and socialist candidate, Zohran Mamdani, leading by double digits, the pressure was on independent candidate former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa to break through to voters at Thursday night\u2019s mayoral debate.",
      "As such, much of the pressure throughout the 2-hour-long debate was on Mamdani.",
      "Here were the top five moments from the debate.",
      "During the debate, Mamdani appeared to backtrack on his position about Hamas laying down their arms, saying, \"Of course I believe that they should lay down their arms.\"",
      "Mamdani was responding to a question from a moderator who said his previous answer, which was made to Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum, was \"confusing,\" after he dodged questions when she asked if he believes Hamas should lay down their weapons and leave leadership in Gaza, according to the cease-fire agreement they entered into.",
      "\"I'm proud to be one of the first elected officials in the state who called for a ceasefire,\" Mamdani said.",
      "\"That means all parties have to ceasefire and put down their weapons. And the reason that we call for that is not only for the end of the genocide, but also an unimpeded access of humanitarian aid. I, like many New Yorkers, and I'm hopeful that this ceasefire will hold.\"",

      "Mamdani was also pressed by Cuomo on his refusal to condemn the phrases \"from the river to the sea\" and \"globalize the intifada,\" both of which are widely seen as calls for the extermination of Jews. Sliwa pressed on this issue as well, \u00a0telling Mamdani, \"Jews don't trust that you will be there for them when they are victims of antisemitic attacks.\"",
      "Mamdani answered that he will be a mayor for all New Yorkers, saying, \"Jewish New Yorkers who have told me about their fear in living in this city, and I will be a mayor who finally addresses that, not through the theatrics of the politics on the stage, but through action.\"",

      "Candidates were asked about the \"threat hanging over the city\" of National Guard troops being sent to New York City. All three candidates indicated they would oppose troops being sent to the city.",
      "Mamdani asserted that \"What New Yorkers need is a mayor who can stand up to Donald Trump and actually deliver on that safety.\"",
      "\"When Donald Trump sent ICE agents on people in Los Angeles, Andrew Cuomo said that New Yorkers need not overreact. That is the furthest answer that New Yorkers are looking for. They are looking for someone who will lead, someone who will say that they will have their back, someone who will actually fight for the people of this city,\" said Mamdani.",

      "You might have noticed that in the past few months, many companies have disclosed data breaches, including Google, Dior and Allianz, and one name that appeared in most cases was Salesforce. Hackers did not breach company networks directly or exploit vulnerabilities in Salesforce's core software. Instead, they targeted the tools and people around it by tricking employees into granting access, compromising third-party apps and abusing overly broad permissions.",
      "Once inside, they siphoned sensitive data from Salesforce environments on an unprecedented scale. Nearly a billion records were stolen across dozens of organizations, and now cybercriminals are extorting victims by threatening to publish the data unless hefty ransoms are paid. Let's look at the recent Salesforce incidents in detail and why this is such a big deal.",

      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.",

      "How AI road sensors work to prevent costly repairs",
      "The system uses a fabric made from flax fibers interwoven with ultra-thin conductive wires. These wires detect minute changes in the asphalt base layer, signaling potential damage before it reaches the surface.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.\u00a0 (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.",
      "Why AI road monitoring matters for future maintenance",
      "Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.",
      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",

      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "How AI and sensor data predict road damage early",
      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",

The most prominent sign of AI-generated email copy is that it looks highly formal with a dash of failed attempts to be personal. You might not notice it at first, but looking at it closely is likely to give a red flag. The language of such emails is often robotic.",

Recently, a\u00a0father lost $4 million in Bitcoin to vishing. Though\u00a0AI voice cloning has improved, it\u2019s still flawed. You can spot inconsistencies by verifying the speaker's identity. Ask specific questions that only the real person would know. This can reveal gaps in the scammer's script. The voice, also, at times may sound robotic due to imperfections in voice cloning technology. So the next time, whenever you receive a call that creates a sense of urgency, ask as many questions as you can to verify the identity of the person. You may also consider verifying the claims through the second channel. If the person on the other side of the phone says something, you can get it confirmed by the official email to be on the safer side.",

The reusable reentry vehicle can transport up to 500 pounds of mission-critical cargo to nearly any point on the planet in less than an hour. Founders Justin Fiaschetti and Austin Briggs launched the company in 2021 with a bold vision: to build a space-based logistics network.

      "How the Arc spacecraft delivers cargo from orbit to Earth",
      "Standing about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide, Arc is roughly the size of a large tabletop. It's a lifting-body vehicle, meaning it can steer as it reenters the atmosphere. Instead of needing a runway, Arc lands safely under parachutes, using non-toxic propellants that make it safe to handle immediately after landing. The spacecraft features a cross-range of approximately 621 miles, allowing it to target wide landing zones. It can stay in orbit for up to five years, ready to return to Earth when needed. That flexibility means the spacecraft could one day drop off medical supplies, drones or military equipment at hard-to-reach locations.",

      "Why fake settlement sites are so convincing",
      "Settlement claim websites rarely look polished. Most have generic layouts, long URLs and simple forms asking for a claim ID from your email or postcard. That makes it easy for scammers to mimic them. To test how simple it is, we created a fake settlement site (below) in minutes using AI tools like ChatGPT.",

A fake site once popped up around the Equifax settlement, tricking thousands before it was shut down. The lesson? If the site appears unusual, it doesn't necessarily mean it's fake, but it should prompt you to double-check before entering your details or clicking on any links.",
      "Red flags that expose fake settlement sites",
      "Spotting a scam often comes down to noticing the little details. Watch for these common warning signs before you hand over your information.",
      "If a site asks for your full Social Security number or the names of your children, stop. For example, the official Equifax settlement only requested the last six digits of SSNs.

    "summary": "Comprehensive analysis of Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps examines usability, routing accuracy, data handling and features across the top navigation platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson discusses Instagram\u2019s new maps feature and more on \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend.\u2019",
      "Navigation apps have become an essential part of modern life. Whether you are commuting to work, running errands or exploring a new city, relying on accurate directions and real-time traffic updates can make all the difference. Over the past decade, Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps have emerged as the dominant players in this space, each offering a distinct approach to navigation.",
      "While millions of people rely on these apps daily, choosing the right one can depend on a variety of factors, from interface design to privacy policies. In this article, we compare these three apps across usability, accuracy, features and data handling to help you determine which one best fits your needs.",

      "What each app does best",
      "Google Maps is widely regarded as the all-rounder. It combines extensive mapping data with points of interest, public transit information, Street View, Live View AR and detailed business listings. Its versatility makes it a top choice for both daily commuters and travelers.",
      "Google Maps is a great way to explore the world with detailed routes, Street View, and real-time traffic insights. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Waze, on the other hand, is designed primarily for drivers. It thrives on community input, offering live updates about traffic jams, road hazards, accidents and even police presence. Since Google owns Waze, many Waze-style real-time alerts have now begun appearing directly inside Google Maps. While Waze still focuses on driving, this integration blurs the lines between the two apps.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0has made major strides in recent years. Once considered the underdog, it's now a solid choice for iOS users. Its clean interface, privacy-focused design and seamless integration with Siri, CarPlay and Apple Watch make it a convenient pick for those fully in the Apple ecosystem.",
      "INSTAGRAM FRIEND MAP FEATURE SPARKS PRIVACY QUESTIONS",
      "Usability and interface",
      "When it comes to interface, each app approaches design differently.",
      "Google Maps provides a dense but intuitive layout, giving users access to multiple layers of information, including traffic, satellite imagery and public transit routes. Switching between driving, walking, biking and transit is straightforward, and the search functionality is robust, often displaying detailed business profiles, ratings, and hours of operation.",
      "Waze prioritizes active driving support. Its interface is visually bold, with clear alerts for traffic jams, accidents and road hazards submitted by other users. While some may find the screen slightly cluttered, the focus is entirely on driving efficiency, which makes sense given its target audience.",
      "Waze helps to put you on a faster route with live, community-driven alerts that help you dodge traffic jams and road hazards.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Apple Maps offers a minimalist, streamlined interface that emphasizes simplicity. Searching for locations, initiating navigation, and following turn-by-turn instructions is straightforward. The app works seamlessly with iOS features like Siri and CarPlay, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for Apple users.",
      "Navigation accuracy and performance",
      "Accurate routing and timely traffic updates are critical.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0remains the most reliable for precise routing and travel time estimates. It combines AI-enhanced predictive routing with historical and live traffic data to suggest the best route. Its consistency holds strong across urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Waze\u00a0is unmatched for real-time rerouting. Relying heavily on crowd-sourced reports, it often detects slowdowns or hazards before Google Maps does. However, it still struggles when offline or in areas with poor data coverage.",
      "Apple Maps has significantly improved its routing accuracy, especially in cities. Its traffic data is now crowd-sourced from millions of iPhones, processed on-device to protect privacy. In some rural or international regions, though, it can still lag behind Google Maps and Waze.",
      "Apple Maps offers seamless use with your iPhone and CarPlay for smooth and privacy-focused navigation.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Features and ecosystem integration",
      "Beyond basic navigation, each app offers additional tools and integrations.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0offers offline maps, Live View AR navigation, multi-stop routing, EV charger locations and indoor maps for airports and malls. Integration with Gmail, Calendar and Google Assistant creates a seamless travel experience.",
      "Waze\u00a0remains focused on social and driving-specific features. You can report hazards or police sightings and even control Spotify, Audible or podcasts directly from the app without switching screens.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0leans into privacy and ecosystem benefits. Its \"Look Around\" feature rivals Street View, while EV routing, cycling paths and Siri integration make it ideal for Apple fans. Apple also uses anonymized \"Look Around\" imagery to train its AI models, but with strict privacy safeguards like blurring faces and plates.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Privacy and data handling",
      "How these apps handle your personal data matters more than ever.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0collects detailed location and usage data to power personalization and advertising. That means better recommendations, but less privacy for users who prefer anonymity.",
      "Waze, also owned by Google, gathers anonymized driving data to enhance community reporting. Its functionality depends on sharing your location in real time, which is necessary for crowd-sourced accuracy.",
      "Apple Maps takes a different approach. It processes most data on-device, uses random identifiers instead of personal accounts and does not associate searches with your Apple ID. That makes it the most privacy-conscious option, though even Apple collects anonymized data for traffic and route improvements.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There is no single \"best\" navigation app, and the right choice depends on your priorities. Google Maps is ideal if you want a feature-packed, versatile app that works well for a variety of transportation modes and travel scenarios. Its global coverage and rich data make it reliable for everyday use and exploration. Waze is best if your main concern is real-time driving efficiency. Its community-driven traffic alerts and dynamic rerouting help you avoid congestion and save time during daily commutes. Apple Maps suits users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who value simplicity, clean design and privacy protections. It may not have as many features as Google Maps or the same real-time edge as Waze, but its seamless integration with iOS makes it convenient.",

      "We spend so much time online that how we connect to the internet has become almost as important as the devices we use. Most people never give it a second thought. They connect their computer to Wi-Fi, type in a password and get on with their day. But if you have ever wondered whether plugging in an Ethernet cable is safer than sticking to wireless, you are asking the right question. The way you connect can have real consequences for your privacy and security. Recently, Kathleen reached out to me with the same doubt.",
      "\"Is it more secure to use the Ethernet connection at home for my computer, or is it safer to use the Wi-Fi from my cable provider?\"",
      "It's a great question, Kathleen, because both options seem similar on the surface but work very differently under the hood. Those differences can mean the difference between a private, secure connection and one that's more vulnerable to attackers.",

      "Ethernet offers direct, wired security without wireless risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Ethernet and Wi-Fi differ when it comes to security",
      "Ethernet and Wi-Fi both get you online, but they do it in completely different ways.\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0uses a physical cable that connects your computer directly to the router. Since it is a wired connection, data travels straight through that cable, making it much harder for anyone to intercept it. There is no wireless signal to hijack, no airwaves to eavesdrop on.",
      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",
      "Whether you stick with Wi-Fi or switch to Ethernet, there are several practical steps you can take to protect your devices and data. Each step adds an extra layer of security to your network.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Choose a long and unique password for your Wi-Fi. Avoid obvious choices like your name, address, or simple sequences. A strong password makes it far harder for attackers to guess or crack your network. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, reducing the chances of a hacker gaining access through weak or repeated credentials.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Most modern routers support WPA3, which is much more secure than older standards like WPA2. Check your router's settings to enable the latest encryption and ensure your network traffic is harder to intercept.",
      "Router manufacturers regularly release updates that patch security vulnerabilities. Log into your router's admin panel occasionally to check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This prevents attackers from exploiting known flaws.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Regularly check which devices are connected to your network and disconnect anything you no longer use. Each connected device is a potential entry point for attackers, so keeping the list limited reduces your network's exposure.",
      "Even on a secure network, malware can sneak in through downloads, phishing attacks, or compromised websites. A strong antivirus program will detect and block malicious activity, protecting your computer before damage occurs.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Ethernet cables connect to a router as part of a home network setup. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A virtual private network encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to outsiders.

A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, which is safer, Ethernet or Wi-Fi? Ethernet wins in raw security because it eliminates many of the risks that come with wireless connections.

    "story": [
      "Skydweller CEO Robert Miller discusses his company's solar-powered drone that can fly for days on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Shoplifting has long been a challenge for retailers, but a U.S. company now believes that flying drones could help combat the issue. Flock Safety, best known for its law enforcement camera systems, is promoting its new Flock Aerodome Drone as an Automated Security system to the private sector. The idea is simple: if a theft occurs, a drone launches, follows the suspect, and streams live video back to security teams or even police. With theft rates reportedly climbing 93% in 2024, the push for high-tech security has never been stronger.",

      "TEXAS COMPANY CREATES DRONES TO CONFRONT SCHOOL SHOOTERS IN SECONDS",
      "Why retailers may be interested",
      "Organized retail crime is a growing problem. Retailers have been reporting higher losses, tighter budgets, and fewer staff members available. Flock Safety argues its drone system can act as a deterrent simply by being visible, making criminals think twice before targeting a store. Beyond retail, the company is also pitching its drones to operators of hospitals, warehouse sites, and energy facilities that require large-scale surveillance.",

      "What this means for you",
      "For shoppers, this could mean visiting stores where drones are part of the security landscape. You might notice them overhead at malls or parking lots, watching for unusual activity. While some may view this as an added safety measure, others may worry about increased surveillance and loss of privacy. For retailers, drones could help protect profits, staff, and customers without the rising costs of hiring additional guards. But whether customers welcome drones buzzing around remains to be seen.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology is quickly reshaping how companies approach security, and drones may soon play a bigger role in everyday shopping environments. With faster response times, broader coverage, and lower staffing costs, the idea has clear appeal for retailers. At the same time, questions about privacy and public acceptance will influence the extent to which this technology is adopted.",

      "\"Law enforcement determined \u2014 using witness statements, video surveillance, cellphone data, and analysis of fire dynamics and patterns at the scene, among other things \u2014 that Rinderknecht maliciously set the Lachman Fire just after midnight on January 1 on land owned by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA), an organization that received federal funding,\" the Attorney\u2019s Office said. \"A week later, the same fire \u2014 then known as the Palisades Fire \u2014 burned federal property.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege Rinderknecht was working as an Uber driver on the evening of Dec. 31, 2024, and that two passengers he drove on separate trips late that night told law enforcement they remembered him appearing \"agitated and angry.\"",

He then used his iPhone to take videos at a nearby hilltop area and listened to a rap song \u2014 to which he had listened repeatedly in previous days \u2014 whose music video included things being lit on fire,\" according to the Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "\"At 12:12 a.m. on January 1, 2025, environmental sensing platforms\u00a0indicated\u00a0the Lachman Fire had begun,\" it also said. \"During an interview with law enforcement on January 24, 2025, Rinderknecht lied about where he was when he first saw the Lachman Fire. He claimed he was near the bottom of a hiking trail when he first saw the fire and called 911, but geolocation data from his iPhone carrier showed that he was standing in a clearing 30 feet from the fire as it rapidly grew.\"",

      "With the capability of hitting beyond even Moscow, the sophisticated high-precision long-range cruise missile could increase Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike further into Russia and better target not only its military complex, but its oil industry, which has largely funded Putin\u2019s war chest.",
      "But one security expert warned that \"no one weapon system is going to be a wonder weapon or a game changer, per se,\" John Hardie, deputy director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 (FDD) Russia Program told Fox News Digital.",
      "Hardie said that countering Russia\u2019s war must be done through a series of tactics which includes increased missile capability for Ukraine, but also by targeting Russia\u2019s war chest by undermining its economy through sanctions, hitting its oil industry and crippling its defense complex.",
      "Thirdly, Ukraine must be better equipped in its war effort on the front lines.",
      "\"Putin still seems to believe, or chooses to believe, that he can grind down Ukrainian forces in this war of attrition, and that eventually that will give him a pathway to accomplishing some of his goals,\" Hardie said. \"He's going to have to be disabused of that.",

      "But neither Tomahawks nor defensive aid were mentioned in the president\u2019s account of the talks.",
      "Though, according to Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov, the issue was discussed and opposed by Putin.",

      "\"A guy who\u2019s been a friend of mine for a long time.

      "\"You have to ask yourself what has changed,\" a former senior Israeli intelligence official told Fox News Digital. \"What prompted him, two years later, to return to the arena of power? The most iconic image is him sitting next to Trump at the U.N. \u2014 that\u2019s where the seeds were planted. Why did Trump suddenly seat him by his side? He was likely told, \u2018He\u2019s the one who can bring us Hamas.\u2019\"",
      "Trump\u2019s public praise underscored a new level of trust between Washington and Ankara. But according to Turkish press reports, Erdogan refused to land his plane in Egypt after learning that Netanyahu \u2014 personally invited by Trump \u2014 might attend the summit. The Turkish president only agreed to land once it was confirmed that the Israeli leader would not be present.",
      "\"It was classic Erdogan theater,\" said Sinan Ciddi, senior fellow and director of the Turkey Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"He likely knew Netanyahu was expected, especially because the U.S. president was there. But refusing to land until Netanyahu was out gives him domestic political capital and boosts his image across parts of the Muslim world.\"",
      "Ciddi also recalled a moment he said was telling about Erdogan\u2019s public posture.

      "Ciddi said Erdogan\u2019s ambitions now go far beyond diplomacy. \"He wants Turkish construction companies to rebuild Gaza, Turkish troops to take part in any enforcement mission, and Turkey to serve as guarantor for the Palestinians,\" he said. \"That would give Ankara both economic and political leverage \u2014 contracts for its companies, troops on the ground, and a seat at every table discussing Gaza\u2019s future.\"",
      "But Ciddi also explains Turkey\u2019s ambitions in Gaza are part of a wider strategic calculus. \"Trump\u2019s demands from Erdogan regarding the F-35 were not just predicated on Gaza,\" he said. \"They included ending Turkey\u2019s energy dependence on Russia, addressing the S-400 missile issue, and playing a constructive role in stabilizing Gaza.\"",

Those who didn\u2019t want Erdogan on the Syrian Golan Heights will get him in Gaza.\"",
      "He said Israel and the U.S. should counterbalance Ankara\u2019s rise by re-energizing cooperation with the Gulf. \"Israel has what Qatar and Turkey don\u2019t \u2014 technology and credibility,\" Golov said. \"If Israel links its innovation with Gulf energy and resources, it can build a regional hub that strengthens the pro-American camp and weakens both the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran.\"",

      "Russia, which has repeatedly claimed it does not target civilians, has routinely hit hospitals throughout its more than three-and-a-half-year-long war, and injured six patients in the Kharkiv region after it hit a facility housing more than 100 patients with precision-guided KAB bombs, reported local news outlet the Kyiv Independent.",
      "Just hours prior, Trump, while on board Air Force One Monday morning, told Fox News that he might have to \"speak\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin on what Russia could be facing should the U.S. hand over the sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine.",

      "Trump on Monday also suggested now that a ceasefire has been forged between Israel and Hamas \u2013 though it has not been fully realized as it can not advance to the second phase in the agreement until all deceased hostages are returned from the Gaza Strip \u2013 he wanted to turn his focus to ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trump suggested that if Russia is unwilling to \"settle\" the war, the U.S. would send Ukraine the Tomahawk missiles it has long sought. Though it remains unclear what will prove to Trump whether Putin is interested in ending his military ambitions in Ukraine, as Putin has continued to hit civilian targets despite numerous meetings between not only him and Trump, but with other White House officials, since Trump re-entered office.",

      "In the wake of Israeli troops\u2019 initial withdrawal from parts of Gaza, Hamas, which has ruled over the enclave since 2007, has tried to regain control, with the militant group\u2019s internal security organization issuing a call urging residents to report \u201cwanted individuals,\u201d including \u201ccollaborators\u201d with Israel.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had confirmed earlier this year that Israel had \"activated\" clans that oppose Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States.

      "\"They\u2019ve probably eliminated Hamas as an actual threat to Israeli security, but in terms of Hamas in the Strip, they are still there and seemingly exercising some coherent control,\" he said, noting that some of the violence appeared to be \"tied up with clan criminality,\" including clans with \"links to Israel.\"",
      "Members of a number of clans in the enclave have clashed with Hamas over the past two years, including the Abu Shabab clan, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, whom Hamas has accused of collaborating with Israel.

      "\u201cThis is really a knockout crowd,\u201d Trump said Wednesday evening, noting that their collective donations have exceeded the ballroom\u2019s $250 million price tag.",
      "And so it has been for the power brokers in Washington during a government shutdown that appears to have no end in sight. While thousands of federal workers are furloughed \u2014 or fired \u2014 and trying to stay afloat without paychecks, the ones responsible for the shutdown are literally, and figuratively, eating cake.",
      "The business-as-usual nature for elected officials in Washington, and some of their aides, is in contrast to the experience of others in the nation\u2019s capital, where federal offices, as well as many parks, landmarks and museums, are closed, and of many people across the country. It also solidifies what now seems to be a bygone era of government shutdowns \u2014 one when elected officials wouldn\u2019t want to be caught anywhere near parties or other nonessential indulgences.",
      "\u201cEverything still seems to be the same, except it\u2019s not. Except most of these people aren\u2019t getting paid,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News, noting that the Senate has continued its committee hearings, constituent meetings and normal voting schedules despite the shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. And so, yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 and it just feels different than any other shutdown.\u201d",
      "The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 after Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and the president, couldn\u2019t agree on a spending bill to keep it funded.",
      "Lawmakers have since been working, to be sure. They\u2019re delivering floor speeches blaming the opposing party for the shutdown and repeatedly casting votes on the same two resolutions to reopen the government that they know don\u2019t have enough support. Some lawmakers have been having informal discussions about potential ways to break the logjam, but Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told NBC News on Thursday that while those talks had been \u201cproductive ... they\u2019re done.\u201d Members of Congress also continue to get paid, as their pay is protected under the Constitution.",
      "But members of their staffs and the many people who keep the Capitol operating aren\u2019t. A congressional staffer, who asked not to be named to protect their privacy, said that while Congress doesn\u2019t seem to be in a big hurry to reopen the government, the shutdown is urgent for them and their family.",
      "\u201cMy husband is a federal worker too, so for us, this is definitely urgent. We have a family to support,\u201d the staffer told NBC News.",
      "Like Congress, Trump has been busy with government business, holding an average of nearly an event a day since the shutdown began. He has traveled to the Middle East to mark a deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. He\u2019s hosting foreign leaders. Later this month, he is scheduled to take a multiday trip to Asia for world leader summits and meetings.",
      "Trump also went forward this week with a previously scheduled Rose Garden ceremony honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last month, on what would have been Kirk\u2019s 32nd birthday. On Friday, he\u2019ll meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House to discuss the war with Russia before he hops on a flight to Florida to spend the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "The White House has called several aides who were initially furloughed back to work in recent days. While those staffers are working without pay, military personnel who service the presidency, such as the pilots, flight attendants and other staff members on Air Force One, are expected to continue receiving paychecks. The Defense Department shifted funding from elsewhere in its budget to ensure members of the military are paid during the shutdown.",
      "The White House also said Thursday that federal law enforcement officers, including those from Customs and Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Secret Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration, will be paid during the shutdown.",
      "Trump, too, will continue getting his paycheck under federal law, though he has said he donates his salary.",
      "At the same time, the White House has used the shutdown as cover to fire some federal workers. The Trump administration has already issued layoff notices to more than 4,000 government employees, though a federal judge blocked the move for now. The White House has said it plans to appeal.",
      "If the firings are allowed to go forward, White House budget chief Russell Vought said, the total could \u201cgrow higher\u201d and \u201cprobably end up being north of 10,000.\u201d",
      "Millions of tourists visit the U.S. Capitol every year, but tours are closed to the public because of the shutdown. Private tour groups arranged by senators and House members, however, have continued in abundance. Unlike in past shutdowns, cafeterias in the Capitol are open, trash is being picked up, grandfather clocks are still being wound, and some lawmakers have yet to furlough a single staff member.",
      "Past shutdowns have led members of Congress to frantically work weekend legislative sessions and hold late-night working pizza dinners to try to end the impasses. But this time, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept his members out of Washington since the shutdown began, and senators have consistently taken three-day weekends.",
      "Asked about the Senate\u2019s weekend breaks, Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News he will continue to allow senators to go home at the end of the week until there\u2019s actual movement in negotiations.",
      "\u201cIf it looks like there\u2019s productive reason for doing it, of course I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Thune said of keeping members in session over a weekend. \u201cBut if, you know, if it\u2019s just no, no, no, no, no and we\u2019re not making any headway, then I\u2019m not sure what the point would be. But you know, I\u2019m open to any suggestion that would help get the government back open.\u201d",
      "Once the government reopens, federal workers will receive back pay to cover the shutdown, whether they worked or not. But that wasn\u2019t always the case. In 2019, Congress passed a law that guaranteed back pay to federal workers furloughed during shutdowns. That guarantee seems to have led lawmakers and the executive branch to furlough fewer staff members this time, senators said.",
      "\u201cI think the vibe is a little bit different this time because of the back pay guarantee,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in an interview this week.",
      "Some Republicans, who were around for the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, said they believe that then-President Barack Obama and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., purposefully made the Capitol complex and federal agencies less hospitable during that funding crisis, hoping the pain would lead lawmakers to end that shutdown.",
      "\u201cI think it was intentionally,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who told NBC News he hasn\u2019t furloughed anyone on his staff for this shutdown.",
      "Obama, he said, was focused on shutting down \u201cas many things you can, make it as hard on everybody as you can, and Harry Reid did the same thing here in the Senate.\u201d",
      "And while lawmakers continue to be paid during the shutdown, Justice, R-W.Va., Babydog\u2019s owner, said he is donating his paycheck to his state\u2019s National Guard.",
      "\u201cThere are people out there depending on us, and right now, it\u2019s a dog\u2019s mess,\u201d Justice said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cA government shutdown is the most ridiculous thing on the planet, and really, truly, we need to be working together and get across the finish line.\u201d",
      "Babydog had no better answer than the humans in the Capitol have had about when the shutdown might end.",
      "\u201cSnort,\u201d she replied when she was asked at her birthday party how Congress and the White House might reach a resolution to reopen the government."

      "\"Love Is Blind\" and \"Married at First Sight\" are two reality series that ask participants to surrender to daring marriage experiments.",
      "\"Love Is Blind\" launched on Netflix in 2020, and has spawned multiple international versions, from France to Brazil. \"Married at First Sight\" was adapted from a Danish version of the show. It began in 2014 on FYI, later moving to Lifetime and, as of 2025, Peacock.",
      "Whether you've watched one or both of the series, there are some clear similarities and differences between the two. Below, we're breaking down how the shows compare.",
      "The Concept",
      "If you've never watched \"Love Is Blind,\" the concept is quite simple. Singles meet in dating pods separated by a black wall. By taking physical looks out of the equation, the show tries to see if people form deeper, more authentic emotional connections. Only by getting engaged can the couples come face-to-face.",

      "Unlike \"Love Is Blind,\" couples commit to marriage before getting to know each other then start working with a group of experts to strengthen their relationship.",
      "Couples have access to pastors, marriage counselors, sexologists, sociologists and relationship specialists to explore their connection and determine if they're ready to go the distance with their new spouse.",

      "\"Gone Before Goodbye\" began with an idea Witherspoon had about three years ago, but felt she couldn't execute on her own. She called up Coben, whom she had met about two and half years before, to help tell the story of Maggie McCabe, a former army combat surgeon who finds herself entangled with billionaire oligarchs, dark money and a dangerous scheme.",

      "The wide application of the \"girl whatever\" trend include: Horses running by a pool, footage from a Lady Gaga concert, a skydiving expedition, or eating a burrito on a beach. It's even reached the NFL: The Pittsburgh Steelers, Kansas City Chiefs and New York Giants have tapped into the trend, posting videos of their players running onto the field.",
      "But how does this two-word phrase tie all these disparate videos together? \"Girl whatever\" is everywhere \u2014 and so is confusion as to its meaning.",

It means leaving behind everything that is not meant for you, clearing space for the things that are.\u201d",
      "The phrase is \u201cnot a diss,\u201d as commenters on this post from an Olivia Rodrigo concert (which got nearly 11 million views) were quick to point out. \u201cTo the people who dont understand: the girl whatever trend goes over a video of you happy living your best lifeee (sic), this is not a diss,\u201d one comment read.",

      "\u201cI do not mind spending 10 dollars on a pastry if they are really good, but you cannot use fake-ass ingredients,\u201d Griffo said in the controversial review, while holding a pistachio croissant. \u201cThat pistachio color is about as natural as my boobs, ass and waistline.\u201d",
      "She was similarly harsh regarding the shop\u2019s coffee, which she deemed \u201csuper sour and acidic,\u201d and its quiche, which she said had a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d crust and so much egg, she \u201cwould have eaten an omelet\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cFive dollars for a canel\u00e9? I didn\u2019t even pay that in San Tro-f---ing-pez,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the price next to the Phoenix Airport? OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cI absolutely loved the pumpkin pie croissant, but everything was a little on the sweet and rich side, which some people love,\u201d she added. \u201cPersonally, I like my sweets a little less sweet, so I\u2019d rather get treated like s--- and go to Paris again.\u201d",
      "Griffo ended her review with this missive: \u201cWith all of that being said, I think if you stay away from the expensive ingredients, like deez nuts, you can definitely enjoy delicious, rich pastry here.\u201d",
      "The Bakery Owner\u2019s Response Goes Viral",
      "Though the review itself didn\u2019t initially go viral, it caught the attention of the bakery, which is owned by Jenna Leurquin. On Oct. 9, she responded in a now-viral video, disputing most of Griffo\u2019s claims, without naming her directly.",
      "\u201cSo, we recently had an influencer reach out to us and asked to do a collaboration, and we respectfully declined, because it was not in our budget right now,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThen, she essentially tried to blackmail us by saying if we offered the food for free, she would then write a good review about us.\u201d",
      "Along with the claim, Leurquin posted a screenshot of a direct message from Griffo in which she said the \u201cmeal will need to be comped including the gratuity\u201d for a collaboration, but that if the bakery accepts, her \u201chonest review\u201d would \u201chighlight/focus on what l enjoyed and be softer/quicker on my words with what I may not like as much.\u201d",
      "Leurquin said she would consider it, but before she\u2019d made up her mind, Griffo came in the next day. The staff recognized her when she came in and were \u201cvery accommodating\u201d and \u201ctotally respected that review,\u201d said Leurquin.",
      "\u201cBut what we don\u2019t like is lying and bullying,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "For the remainder of the video, she pushes back on the accusation that the bakery\u2019s ingredients are fake: They use PreGel pistachio paste, which is \u201cmade from the finest pistachios,\u201d Panettone flour from Italy, and other imported ingredients. \u201cNot bad for a \u2018close to the airport bakery,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "Aafter showing some of the bakery\u2019s preparation processes and noting everything is made from scratch, Leurquin ends the video with a message to all influencers.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me. This specific influencer has gone to many different local restaurants and bullied them,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThe problem is if the next generation is influenced by her to believe it\u2019s OK to bully and disrespect the food industry.\u201d",

It\u2019s mind blowing.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian has opened up about the \"narrative\" that she keeps her four children from seeing their father, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and how she has \"never once done that.\"",
      "The reality star and beauty mogul spoke with Alex Cooper for the Oct. 15 episode of the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast about how she co-parents with Ye. Kardashian, 44, also spoke about what made her finally seek a divorce from the controversial rapper, the last time he spoke with their children, and why she decides to stay silent when Ye posts screeds about her online.",
      "Kardashian and Ye, who were married from 2014 to 2022, share children North, 12, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 6.",
      "\"What do you think co-parenting with Kanye West is like?\" Kardashian asked when Cooper broached the subject. \"It\u2019s not easy, but I raise the kids, full time. They live with me, and I welcome a great, healthy relationship with my kids and their dad, and I think he knows that.",
      "\"I push for it all the time, but I also protect them when it\u2019s time for that. And it goes in waves and phases, and it\u2019s a lot of work.\"",
      "Kardashian also shared the last time the children have been in contact with their father.",
      "\"Whenever he\u2019ll call for them and ask,\" she said. \"It\u2019s probably been a couple months since we\u2019ve heard from him. They always knew that he had a big life traveling before and was always on tour and all of that, and that he lives in different countries all the time and loves to live all over the place. We manage it really well.\"",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Ye for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Kardashian tries to keep her focus on her children.",
      "\"They love their life and their routine and their schedule,\" she said. \"And I think just the job as their mom is just to make sure that they stick to their routine, and they\u2019re healthy and happy.\"",
      "She also addressed the speculation that she does not let her kids see their father.",
      "\"Look, it\u2019s not easy no matter what, co-parenting with anyone. I think that the one thing that just gets me is that there\u2019s this narrative that I keep the kids away from him,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve never once done that.",
      "\"There\u2019s been so many times where I\u2019ve been like, 'Ah, I just want to show all of these texts. What are you talking about?' Like, we just haven\u2019t heard (from Ye),\" she continued. \"I beg them to go hang out or things like that.\"",
      "Ye has accused Kardashian on social media of not allowing him to see the children, which she has denied.",
      "\"It\u2019s more of just the narrative that, like, I think it\u2019s all good and we\u2019re living our life, and then I just wake up and there\u2019s all these tweets about how I\u2019ve kidnapped the kids,\" Kardashian said. \"And I\u2019m like, it\u2019s not a kidnapping, it\u2019s a divorce, you know? We can still all be in each other\u2019s lives and have group dinner.\"",
      "Kardashian said her mother, reality star Kris Jenner, says she needs to give it \"five years of being divorced\" before \"everyone can coexist and be friends.\"",
      "\"Every time he has asked, I will always let them see their father,\" Kardashian said. \"That\u2019s just who I am. If there\u2019s a time where it\u2019s just really super unhealthy, I will say, 'Hey, let\u2019s do it here at my house, or let\u2019s figure out a different time.' But actually when he is like that, he doesn\u2019t really want to see the kids a lot.\"",
      "Kardashian said Ye has lived in Saudi Arabia, Italy and Japan, and she has \"never once denied\" her children going to visit him.",
      "\"I don't keep the kids, and I think that all that narrative really sucks for me,\" she said. \"And if I spoke out about it and rebutted it, I\u2019m just not that girl online that\u2019s going to, like, fight back and be like, 'Wait a minute, your assistant and you said you wanted a whole different birthday party, and you said your party\u2019s at 4 (o'clock), so we did ours at noon, and now you\u2019re going online saying (something else).' It\u2019s just a totally different narrative than what the reality is, and that just really sucks.\"",
      "Ye has previously said derogatory things about Kardashian on social media, but she does not respond.",
      "\"There has been so many times where I\u2019ve written a draft and been like, 'I\u2019m going to go,'\" she said. \"And then I\u2019m just like, 'What\u2019s the point? What is the point? Am I going to go back and forth? My kids are going to see this.' They\u2019ll figure it all out when when they want to make those decisions. And I used to be so protective and so 'hide everything,' and then sometimes you just can\u2019t hide it all.\"",
      "\"I never say anything negative about my kid\u2019s dad just because it\u2019s out there,\" she continued. \"Like, the last thing my kids need is for them to hear it from me. And I never saw my parents talk bad about each other no matter what was going on. I do think that that\u2019s just who I am. I just don\u2019t want to go there with, like, fighting back, saying negative things, you know?\"",
      "That's not to say she hasn't thought about it.",
      "\"I wish I did last time,\" she said. \"I had a good post ready to go.\"",
      "She added that it's hard for her to stay restrained when Ye has said negative things online about her mother.",
      "\"That\u2019s what\u2019s really hard for me, because she loves him, and to this day still does and is super emotional about it and sad about it. It was a big part of our lives,\" Kardashian said. \"My kids, I say such positive things about their dad that, like, North had to say to me, 'Mom, I think you go upstairs and, like, cry at night. Like, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s time to move on. You need to have a boyfriend now.' And I\u2019m like, 'Wait, what? What? I cry? No, I'm getting a massage upstairs. What do you think is happening?'\"",
      "Kardashian also shared why she split with Ye, between him saying negative things about her mother and sisters and airing out \"personal stuff.\"",
      "\"Just not feeling safe, not even physically, just, like, maybe emotionally or even financially,\" she said, adding, \"We had, like, five Lamborghinis, and I\u2019d come home and they\u2019d all be gone if he was in an episode. And I\u2019d be like, 'Oh, wait, where\u2019s all our cars? My new car.' And it would be like, 'Oh, he gave them away to all of his friends.'\"",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get when you wake up,\" she continued. \"And that\u2019s, like, a really unsettling feeling. Lack of stability was a big thing.\""

I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself,\u201d Spears wrote. \u201cThe conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child.

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 19:36:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Who was Adeline Watkins and what happened to her? This is the true story of Ed Gein's girlfriend and how it compares to what's shown in the series.",
    "story": [
      "The newest season of Netflix's \"Monster\" not only depicts killer Ed Gein and his macabre crimes, it also shows him with a female companion whose role in his life has been disputed.",
      "Charlie Hunnam plays the man who became known as The Butcher of Plainfield for the grisly crimes uncovered at his Wisconsin farm in 1957. Gein admitted to killing two local women and robbing graves at a local cemetery to make ghoulish items like bowls, lampshades and upholstered chairs out of human skin and bone.",
      "In \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" actor Suzanna Son plays a woman named Adeline Watkins, who appears to be Gein\u2019s girlfriend and a woman who shares some of his interest in gruesome murders.",
      "Was she a real person? Here's what to know.",
      "Who Was Adeline Watkins?",
      "Following Gein's arrest in 1957, a local woman from Gein's hometown of Plainfield named Adeline Watkins gave an interview with the Minneapolis Tribune, which was reprinted in the Wisconsin State Journal on Nov. 21, 1957, saying Gein once proposed to her.",
      "Watkins, who was 50 years old at the time, described Gein as \"good and kind and sweet\" in the article.",
      "She claimed the two had a 20-year romance and that Gein \"was so nice about doing things I wanted to do that sometimes I felt I was taking advantage of him.\"",
      "\"I loved him and I still do,\" she added.",
      "She was described by the reporter as \"a plain woman with graying bangs and horn-rimmed glasses.\"",
      "Watkins said her last date with Gein was on Feb. 6, 1955, about two years before he was arrested. She claimed that Gein didn't explicitly propose to her that night, but she \"knew what he meant.\"",
      "\"I turned him down, but not because there was anything wrong with him,\" she continued. \"It was something wrong with me. I guess I was afraid I wouldn't be able to live up to what he expected of me.\"",
      "Watkins' mother was also quoted saying Gein was a \"sweet, polite man\" who always had her daughter home by 10 p.m. from a date.",
      "Watkins added that she and Gein often talked about books, including his favorites about lions, tigers, Africa and India. She said they also loved true crime.",
      "\"I guess we discussed every murder we ever heard about,\" she said. \"Eddie told how the murdered did wrong, what mistakes he had made. I thought it was interesting.\"",
      "What Did Ed Gein Say About His Relationship with Adeline Watkins?",
      "Gein never publicly made any mention of Watkins.",
      "In the book \"Unhinged\" by Robert Keller, Gein was described as a \"lonely old bachelor\" whom local farmers' wives took pity on and delivered meals and cookies to him at his farm.",
      "Watkins said in the Minneapolis Tribune that she and Gein went on dates to the movies or a local tavern. She said she had to \"drag\" Gein into a tavern because he did not drink.",
      "However, one of the women Gein admitted to murdering was a tavern owner, Mary Hogan. He frequently visited her establishment and looked at her as a \"mirror image of his sainted mother,\" according to \"Unhinged.\" It's unclear whether Watkins and Gein ever visited Hogan's tavern or if they were ever truly a couple.",
      "Following his arrest, Gein lived in state psychiatric facilities until his death in 1984.",
      "While growing up under their mother's domineering presence, Gein and his brother were warned constantly by their mother about the immorality of women and told to avoid them. Neither of them ever married, and Ed Gein remained obsessed with his mother until her death and beyond.",
      "Adeline Watkins Retracted Her Statements",
      "Watkins' interview with the Minnesota paper was picked up by The Associated Press and made national headlines for her alleged love affair with a ghoulish murderer and grave robber.",
      "She then spoke to the local Stevens Point Journal in Wisconsin for a story that ran on Dec. 3, 1957, and denied some of her previous statements.",
      "Watkins said there was no 20-year romance between the two, only that she had known him for 20 years. She said she had only spent time with him during a seven-month period in 1954 and went to a few shows at a local theater and spent time with him at her home. She said she never visited his home.",
      "She denied that she or her mother had referred to Gein as \"sweet\" in the interview. She also denied saying she had to \"practically drag\" Gein into a local tavern.",
      "Outside of the two newspaper stories, Watkins did not speak publicly about Gein again. She died at 85 in 1992 and was buried in the Plainfield Cemetery in Wisconsin. It's one of the cemeteries where Gein admitted to digging up corpses in the 1940s and '50s.",
      "How is Adeline Watkins Portrayed in 'Monster'?",
      "Son portrays Watkins as Gein's girlfriend in the Netflix series. It also shows her as complicit in his crimes. There is no evidence of that ever happening.",
      "Son's character shows him photos of Holocaust victims and notorious Nazi war criminal Ilse Koch, and then Gein shows her the hair-raising items he made out of human body parts. She is shown a bowl made of a skull, a belt made out of women's nipples and a chair upholstered with human skin, all of which were real items found by authorities at Gein's home in Plainfield, Wisconsin.",
      "He also introduces Son's character to his \"mother,\" which is really a corpse of his late mother sitting in a chair with her back to Watkins like a scene straight out of \"Psycho,\" which was inspired by Gein's crimes. Adeline then promptly leaves.",
      "Gein denied digging up the body of his mother, Augusta Gein, who died of a stroke in 1945.",
      "In a later episode, the two are seen at a graveyard, where Watkins accepts a wedding proposal from Gein. She is then shown wanting to have sex with him, but he stops her because he's been taught by his mother that sex is only for procreation.",
      "The two are then shown moving in together, and Watkins is depicted as having a morbid fascination when she finds the corpse of one of Gein's victims. Yet another disturbing scene shows Watkins photographing corpses mutilated by Gein and encouraging necrophilia.",
      "None of these events appear to have happened, according to police reports, interviews with Gein and the interviews with Watkins.",
      "In perhaps a nod to the Minneapolis Tribune interview by Watkins, Son's character is later shown seeking media attention to grab the spotlight after Gein's crimes have been made public. In the final episode, she meets with Gein in his psychiatric hospital and confesses to disturbing urges.",
      "Neither Gein nor Watkins ever spoke of any meeting between them while Gein was in the hospital."

      "Video obtained by Reuters this week appeared to show masked gunmen executing several men in a Gaza City street. In the footage, at least six people could be seen being forced to their knees, with their shirts pulled over their heads, before being shot.",
      "In other footage, at least two of the people carrying out the executions appeared to be wearing the green headbands typically worn by Hamas\u2019 military wing, the Qassam Brigades. NBC News verified the location of the video inside Gaza but not that the men shown were members of Hamas.",
      "Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the incidents. Last month, before the current ceasefire, Hamas-led authorities said three men were executed after being accused of collaborating with Israel, Reuters reported at the time.",
      "President Donald Trump issued a clear warning about the violence on Thursday.",
      "\"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Asked at a press gathering whether he meant that U.S. troops could be involved, Trump said, \"It's not gonna be us. We won't have to. There are people very close, very nearby that will go in. They'll do the trick very easily but under our auspices.\"",
      "In the wake of Israeli troops\u2019 initial withdrawal from parts of Gaza, Hamas, which has ruled over the enclave since 2007, has tried to regain control, with the militant group\u2019s internal security organization issuing a call urging residents to report \u201cwanted individuals,\u201d including \u201ccollaborators\u201d with Israel.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had confirmed earlier this year that Israel had \"activated\" clans that oppose Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States. His comments came after Israeli media, including the Times of Israel, reported he had authorized giving weapons to a particular group in southern Gaza, citing defense sources.",
      "Calling on Hamas to \"suspend violence\" in the enclave on Wednesday, CENTCOM\u2019s commander, Adm. Brad Cooper, said the truce brought by Trump's 20-point ceasefire plan marked a \"historic opportunity for peace.\"",
      "\"Hamas should seize it by fully standing down,\" he said.",
      "Trump's warning on Thursday followed comments earlier in the week in which he appeared to downplay the violence in Gaza, saying Hamas had taken out \"a couple of gangs that were very bad,\" before adding, \"that didn't bother me much.\"",
      "The flashes of violence this week came as the U.S. and Israel continued to call for Hamas\u2019 disarmament, a key stipulation of Trump\u2019s plan and a longstanding sticking point in talks for a lasting truce.",
      "The Israeli military was accused of repeatedly opening fire on Palestinians this week amid the truce. The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged one incident Tuesday in which it said troops opened fire on people who came near forces stationed along the withdrawal line agreed under the first phase of Trump\u2019s plan, which it said was a violation of the agreement.",
      "Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit based in Brussels, said there was still a lack of clarity around how the disarmament of Hamas might actually play out.",
      "\"None of this has been spelled out \u2014 what kind of weapons, under what conditions ... none of it. None of it is on paper,\" he said. \"It is a kind of aspirational endpoint without many signposts about how to get there.\"",
      "What is clear, Hanna said in an interview on Wednesday, is that \u201cHamas is not gone.\u201d",
      "\"I mean, lots of people have said this for a long time, that Israel would not be able to eliminate or destroy Hamas, and they haven\u2019t,\" Hanna said.",
      "\"They\u2019ve probably eliminated Hamas as an actual threat to Israeli security, but in terms of Hamas in the Strip, they are still there and seemingly exercising some coherent control,\" he said, noting that some of the violence appeared to be \"tied up with clan criminality,\" including clans with \"links to Israel.\"",
      "Members of a number of clans in the enclave have clashed with Hamas over the past two years, including the Abu Shabab clan, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, whom Hamas has accused of collaborating with Israel. The Doghmosh clan, one of the biggest and most powerful in Gaza, has also been at odds with Hamas.",
      "Reuters reported that Hamas fighters had clashed with members of Doghmosh on Sunday and Monday, citing security sources. NBC News was not immediately able to verify that reporting.",
      "\"There are well-known clans and personalities,\" Hanna said. \"Anybody at this point who is trying to operate independently outside of Hamas authority in the places where it is present is probably going to have trouble.\"",
      "In a statement released on Tuesday following a gathering of Palestinian tribes and clans in the Gaza Strip, some clans warned that protection would be withdrawn from any members \u201cproven to be involved in any violation that threatens our societal security and civil peace.\u201d",
      "They urged groups to \u201cfully adhere to this decision\u201d to keep the peace and to \u201chand over perpetrators and violators to the competent authorities,\u201d in an apparent reference to Hamas.",
      "\"I think it was a stupid strategy for Israel to try to rely on some of these clans,\" Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of Realign for Palestine, a project of the Atlantic Council, said. \"Hamas made a name for themselves early on by basically breaking a lot of these clans and by having the ability to say we\u2019re bringing law and order.\"",
      "The gang violence in Gaza comes as peace efforts have also been complicated by Hamas' failure to return many of the 28 bodies of hostages killed in captivity.",
      "Hamas said Wednesday that the remaining bodies required \u201csignificant efforts and specialized equipment to search for and retrieve.\u201d",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz told senior Israel Defense Forces commanders to prepare a military plan to defeat Hamas if the militant group refuses to implement the U.S.-brokered peace plan, according to Katz\u2019s spokesperson."

      "Trump's comments came after a phone call with Putin and a day before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to visit the White House.",
      "Trump said he and Putin \"agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week,\" though the location has not been determined. The U.S. delegation will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, after which Trump and Putin will meet, he said.",
      "\"President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this 'inglorious' War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end,\" Trump wrote.",

      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, shared Trump\u2019s post on X, calling the meeting \u201cpositive\u201d and \"important for the world.\u201d",
      "In a subsequent post, he accused \u201cwarmongers\u201d from the United Kingdom and the European Union of trying \u201cvery very hard to derail peace prospects,\u201d without elaborating on the claim. \u201cBut dialogue and peace and the US-Russia cooperation will prevail,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Trump and Putin met in Alaska in August for an initial round of talks on ending the war, but that summit ultimately did not result in any movement toward peace. The leaders spent nearly three hours in the highly anticipated meeting, which saw Trump give Putin a red-carpet welcome \u2014 drawing fire from Trump's critics.",
      "Zelenskyy is set to visit the White House on Friday as Trump weighs whether to approve Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine. The long-range missiles could be used strike deep inside Russia, and if the U.S. supplied the weapons, it would mark a new level of support from the administration for Ukraine.",
      "Trump spoke with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine days after Israel and Hamas agreed to his peace proposal to end the war in Gaza, leading to a ceasefire and the release of all living hostages held in the territory and Palestinian prisoners from the Middle Eastern country.",
      "Trump said in his Truth Social post that he believed \"that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine.\"",
      "During his campaign, Trump vowed to quickly end the war in Ukraine, going so far as to say he could do so within 24 hours of taking office. As the months dragged on without a deal, Trump downplayed his previous predictions and his rhetoric toward Putin shifted, saying Putin had \"let me down.\"",
      "Trump's stance on any concessions from Ukraine has also taken a dramatic turn. While he previously said the two countries might need to engage in the \"swapping of territories,\" which Zelenskyy has adamantly opposed, last month Trump said on Truth Social that Ukraine \"with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.\""

      "The president of Madagascar has been ousted in a military coup after a weekslong uprising by Gen Z protesters whose outrage is being felt in countries around the world \u2014 and expressed through a common, anime-inspired symbol.",
      "The military in the Indian Ocean nation took power Tuesday right after lawmakers voted to impeach President Andry Rajoelina, who said Monday night in a speech from an undisclosed location that he had fled the country in fear for his life after an elite military unit joined the protesters.",
      "It\u2019s the second government Gen Z protesters have toppled in just over a month, after the prime minister of Nepal resigned last month in the face of protests set off by outrage over a social media ban.",
      "Young people angered by economic hardship, official corruption and perceived injustice have been central players in a recent wave of anti-government protests around the world, including in Indonesia, the Philippines, East Timor, Peru and Morocco.",
      "Despite being scattered across oceans and continents, the protests are connected by the frequent appearance of the same emblem: a pirate flag from a globally popular Japanese anime series.",
      "The flag, which features a grinning Jolly Roger skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat, is from the manga series \u201cOne Piece,\u201d whose protagonists, the Straw Hat Pirates, rebel against an unjust world and defy corrupt powers.",
      "Young protesters in Madagascar and elsewhere are reimagining the manga characters\u2019 fight against injustice as their own, anime experts say.",
      "They are likely to identify with anime protagonists \u201cwho are often depicted as minorities, who are marginalized, ignored and misunderstood by their societies,\u201d said Katsuya Izumi, a senior lecturer in language and culture studies at Trinity College in Connecticut.",
      "Frustrated by chronic power and water shortages, young people in Madagascar, an island nation off southeastern Africa, first took to the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, on Sept. 25. The protests were mobilized largely by Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group that is powered by social media.",
      "The group\u2019s official logo on its social media accounts is the \u201cOne Piece\u201d symbol, customized for Madagascar by replacing the straw hat with the satroka bucket hat traditionally worn by the Betsileo ethnic group.",
      "As in the protests in Nepal, Indonesia and elsewhere, the focus of the movement in Madagascar \u2014 a former French colony of about 30 million people that is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2014 broadened from a lack of basic necessities to anger over inequality, corruption and widespread political impunity.",
      "Soon, young protesters in Madagascar, where the median age is 19, were demanding the resignation of Rajoelina, 51, who came to power in a military-backed coup in 2009.",
      "\u201cWe just can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d To Ranaivoharijao, 26, a member of Gen Z Madagascar\u2019s communications team, said in an interview this month.",
      "\u201cThe president is building a cable car in the capital, while most of the population is suffering from malnutrition, lack of clean water and power outages,\u201d he said via messaging app.",
      "Madagascar authorities responded to the protests with force, with witnesses reporting widespread use of tear gas, rubber bullets and even firearms.",
      "According to the United Nations, at least 22 people have been killed in the Madagascar protests, a figure the government has disputed.",
      "Local protesters say they have been inspired by youth-driven movements against ruling elites in Nepal and elsewhere.",
      "The protests\u2019 global spread has been aided by the pirate flag from \u201cOne Piece,\u201d whose popularity has made its ideas about resistance accessible across languages and cultures.",
      "According to Guinness World Records, the \u201cOne Piece\u201d series, which was started in 1997 by Japanese manga author Eiichiro Oda, holds the record for most published copies of the same single-author comic book series, at more than half a billion.",
      "It has been translated into 40 languages and turned into animated series, feature films, a card game, video games and a Netflix live-action version, creating a \u201cshared subcultural language,\u201d said Rayna Denison, a professor of film and digital arts at the University of Bristol in Britain.",
      "The series\u2019 main protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy, is a \u201csymbol of freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cThis makes the use of his Jolly Roger an emphatic endorsement of values.\u201d",
      "Those values may be challenged under Madagascar\u2019s new military government, which has suspended the constitution and says a referendum will be held in two years."

      "A prominent doctor who had become a voice for besieged Palestinians in Gaza and was detained by Israeli forces in December has had his detention without charge extended, his family and legal representatives said Thursday.",
      "The family and supporters of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, had hoped he would be released under a ceasefire deal, along with dozens of medical workers who had been detained during Israel\u2019s offensive in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "According to an X post by Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, a legal group based in Gaza, an Israeli court \u201crubberstamped\u201d the extension of Abu Safiya\u2019s detention for another six months in a closed-door hearing.",
      "In a separate statement on Abu Safiya\u2019s own account, his family also said his administrative detention had been extended. Israel has not commented on the case.",
      "\u201cThere has been one shock after another, and the size of the pain is indescribable,\u201d Abu Safiya\u2019s son Elias Abu Safiya told NBC News  over WhatsApp on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can sleep while my father is worried, how I can eat while my father is hungry, and how I can live my normal life.\u201d",
      "Abu Safiya\u2019s family and supporters had hoped and expected he would be among the around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees Israel agreed to exchange for 48 hostages held by Hamas on Monday as part of a ceasefire deal.",
      "The Israeli military initially denied Abu Safiya was in its custody, but in a statement in January, it said without providing evidence he had been involved in \u201cterrorist activities\u201d and held \u201ca rank\u201d in Hamas that made Kamal Adwan Hospital a stronghold during the war.",
      "Abu Safiya\u2019s son and colleagues, including the Chicago-based nonprofit MedGlobal, which has partnered with local care workers in Gaza for years and arranges volunteer medical missions to the enclave, have rejected these allegations. Abu Safiya was the lead physician in Gaza for MedGlobal before his detention.",
      "Prior to his detention in December 2024, Abu Safiya had warned that Israeli strikes were putting patients, medics and sheltering civilians at risk, calling for the world to intervene to \u201cprotect the health care system.\u201d He refused to leave the side of his patients, even as tanks and bulldozers encircled his hospital.",
      "Abu Safiya was last seen in Gaza in December walking from Kamal Adwan Hospital toward Israeli tanks. Video verified by NBC News showed Abu Safiya, a lone figure in a white doctor\u2019s coat, moving through a rubble-strewn street surrounded by bombed-out buildings. The footage was believed to capture the moments before he was detained by Israeli soldiers.",
      "After detention orders in Abu Safiya\u2019s case were previously upheld by an Israeli court in March, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights maintained his innocence, saying in a news release that he was \u201csolely performing medical and administration duties at Kamal Adwan Hospital.\u201d",
      "Al Mezan says Abu Safiya reported enduring torture and inhumane living conditions to a lawyer who was previously able to visit him at Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli Prison Service told NBC News it does not provide details regarding the \u201cidentity, conditions, or legal status of prisoners and detainees.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has responded to those allegations by saying it acts in accordance with both the country\u2019s and international law and \u201cprotects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the case, the Israeli military referred NBC News to the Israeli Ministry of Justice. In a statement, the ministry said it was not responsible for determining the identity of those who are released.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "At least 115 medical workers remained in Israeli custody, as well as the remains of four who died while in Israeli custody, it said in the news release on Monday.",
      "More than 9,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli prisons, according to data published by HaMoked, an Israeli human rights organization.",
      "Many of them are being held under \u201cadministrative detention,\u201d according to the organization \u2014 a practice in which Israeli authorities hold people without trial or other usual legal proceedings, often based on alleged secret evidence they often do not share with detainees, their families or legal representatives.

      "The two men were treated only yards apart. Lakin died, but his killer survived.",
      "\u201cI think I would have jumped on him and done something but he had police standing there,\u201d Avni said. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, you know, you\u2019ll go to jail for life, and you\u2019ve got responsibilities.\u201d",
      "Recounting the cruel irony of his father\u2019s killing still brings tears to Avni\u2019s eyes. His father had been a peace-loving school principal who advocated for racially integrated education, had marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and participated in the anti-segregation \u201cFreedom Riders\u201d movement during the 1960s.",
      "The family moved to Israel when Avni was 15 years old.",
      "\u201cHe was a big believer in coexistence. I wish everybody could be like that, but they\u2019re not,\u201d Avni said of his father. \u201cIt was an innocent world view.\u201d",

      "The figures do not include a suspected bear attack involving a 60-year-old hot spring worker who went missing on Thursday after he went to clean an outdoor bath. Investigators found human blood and what appeared to be bear fur at the scene of the suspected attack in Iwate Prefecture.",
      "A body was found nearby on Friday, and hunters accompanying a search and rescue team shot and killed a bear in the area.",

      "Experts believe that a combination of a growing bear population in Japan and people moving to cities from rural areas, leaving behind more habitat for bears, have both played a major role in the increasing number of incidents. Climate change has also been cited as a factor because of its effect on food supply and hibernation patterns.",

      "Dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, the wrestlers known as rikishi, have been exploring the city in between rigorous training for what is just the second event of this type to be held outside Japan in 1,500 years.",
      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",

      "\u201cBeing a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Hoshoryu said. \u201cMy uncle was a yokozuna \u2014 and I\u2019m happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m even happier,\u201d he added.",
      "Stopping to pose for pictures with traditional souvenirs, the pair were among a group of sumo wrestlers who visited most of London's touristic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Westminster with its iconic Big Ben.",
      "But that didn't stop them from their rigorous training routine and their equally rigorous eating regime.",

      "But in a break from their traditional diet, some of the wrestlers were pictured enjoying London's street food and feeding each other hot dogs as they explored the city.",
      "While the tournament in London was completely sold out, back home Sumo has faced a series of scandals, including allegations of bullying, assault and sexism at stables where the wrestlers train. Allegations of illegal betting and links to organized crime have also cast a shadow over the image of Japan's national sport.",
      "But in London, Wednesday saw the first day of the five-day exhibition tournament \u2014 the first of its kind since one was hosted at the same venue some 34 years ago.",
      "The wrestlers, who weigh a combined six tons, slapped, gripped and lifted each other, as spectators reveled at the sight of the centuries-old Japanese sport.",
      "Around eleven tons of clay were brought into the hall to build the dohyo, the raised ring where the wrestlers compete, outlined with rice bales shaped and secured using beer bottles, according to Reuters.",
      "The two grand champions, Hoshoryu and Onosato, each secured victory in their bouts, closing the evening with weighty performances \u2014 literally."

But officials also have suggested that the strikes \u2014 and a ramped-up U.S. military presence in the region \u2014 are meant to pile pressure on the regime in Venezuela."

    "story": [
      "When it comes to the best foods for easing chronic constipation, are kiwis on your grocery list?",
      "New dietary guidelines from the British Dietetic Association, published Monday, say that kiwis \u2014 along with rye bread and certain supplements \u2014 can help improve constipation symptoms.",
      "The guidelines, the authors say, are the first evidence-based recommendations for treating constipation with diet, not medications.",
      "Chronic constipation affects around 16% of adults worldwide, and constipation is the reason for almost 2.5 million doctors visits in the U.S. per year, according to the American College of Gastroenterology.",
      "Eirini Dimidi, a lead author of the guidelines, said the existing guidance for managing chronic constipation is largely focused on pharmaceuticals.",
      "The few dietary recommendations out there \u2014 eat more fiber, drink more water \u2014 are ambiguous and often lack research to back them up.",
      "\u201cI remember looking at the guidelines and realizing that they are just really limited in the number of dietary recommendations they make,\u201d said Dimidi, a registered dietician and associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at King\u2019s College in London.",
      "To come up with the new guidelines, the authors analyzed clinical trials and evaluated each method\u2019s effectiveness for managing constipation. The recommendations were jointly published in the Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility.",
      "What is chronic constipation?",
      "Constipation \u2014 defined by fewer than three bowel movements a week \u2014 is considered chronic if it lasts for more than three months.",
      "Symptoms can vary from person to person, but common ones are hard or lumpy stool, stomachache and nausea. More serious symptoms of constipation include blood in stool, fever and vomiting.",
      "Constipation can be caused by diet, lifestyle, certain illnesses and injuries, and some medications. It\u2019s extremely common, affecting people of all ages, gender and race.",
      "\u201cI see chronic constipation across the spectrum,\u201d said Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cI see it in toddlers, I see it in school-age children, I see it in adults. So it\u2019s a common thing,\u201d she said.",
      "Chronic constipation can severely impact people\u2019s lives and limit their physical abilities, worsening their quality of life and work productivity.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re chronically constipated, you may not be able to even participate in physical activity, because you feel bloated, you\u2019re in pain, you\u2019re achy, it may affect your mood,\u201d said Anderson-Haynes, who also owns 360 Girls and Women, a nutrition and health practice based in Boston.",
      "How is chronic constipation treated?",
      "Dr. William Chey, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan and incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said most studies on treating chronic constipation have focused on fiber supplements, like psyllium, and medications, like bisacodyl, senna and amitiza.",
      "He added American guidelines \u201cfocus pretty heavily on medical therapies for chronic constipation.\u201d",
      "Traditional constipation treatments include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives.",
      "While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there\u2019s no guidance on a \u201chigh-fiber diet\u201d overall.",
      "\u201cWhen we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn\u2019t enough in constipation,\u201d Dimidi said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don\u2019t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.\u201d",
      "What are the new recommendations?",
      "Chey, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations \u201cprovide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they\u2019re waiting to see their primary care physician.\u201d",
      "He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist.",
      "The recommendations include:",
      "Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, B. lactis and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for at least four weeks.",

The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A jubilant Donald Trump celebrated a hard-won ceasefire Monday in the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, while inviting Middle East leaders to create a lasting peace that unlocks the region\u2019s potential for dramatic economic growth.",
      "As all 20 living hostages rejoined their families in Israel, Trump spoke to the nation's parliament in Jerusalem and marked a momentous breakthrough in a war that began just over two years ago.",
      "The U.S. president who wrung a peace deal from bitter combatants told the Knesset that \u201cthe long and painful nightmare is finally over.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not only the end of a war,\u201d said Trump, who had arrived in Israel in the morning. \u201cThis is the end of an age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God.",
      "\"It\u2019s the start of a grand concord and lasting harmony for Israel and all the nations of what will soon be a truly magnificent region.\u201d",
      "Making it so won\u2019t be easy. Old antagonisms could resurface at any point, jeopardizing the truce that Trump and his advisers brokered over the past few months.",
      "An accusation of bad faith came right away. Family members said Monday that Hamas had released the remains of only four of 28 deceased hostages, breaking a commitment. They called for an \u201cimmediate suspension\u201d of the ceasefire agreement until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Dueling statements from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also suggested they differed over something as fundamental as whether the fighting was truly over.",
      "Netanyahu, speaking on television Sunday, said, \u201cThe campaign is not over\u201d and that \u201csome of our enemies are trying to recover in order to attack us again.\u201d",
      "Asked about that on Air Force One en route to Israel, Trump told reporters: \u201cThe war is over. The war is over. The war is over, OK? You understand that?\u201d Lest there be any doubt, Trump reinforced the point during his remarks to the Knesset while Netanyahu sat and listened.",
      "\u201cNow you can be a little nicer, Bibi, because you\u2019re not at war anymore, Bibi,\u201d he said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname.",
      "After finishing his speech, Trump flew to Egypt to take part in a peace conference with the leaders of 20 nations, posing for pictures in front of a sign proclaiming, \u201cPeace in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Notably missing from the signing ceremony were the two parties who\u2019d been at war: Hamas and Israel. Trump had invited Netanyahu to the ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, but the Israeli leader chose not to attend. His office cited the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah as the reason. Without Netanyahu and a representative from Hamas, the day lacked what often turns out to be an iconic picture at such Middle East peace ceremonies: the U.S. president and the combatants linking arms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary moment and demonstration of will by an American president: a bid to end the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations, said in an interview. \u201cBut to do that you need to climb several very high mountains.\u201d",
      "Richard Goldberg, who served on the White House National Security Council in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote on X: \u201cToday is a celebration. Trump and Netanyahu delivered the opportunity for peace through strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cTomorrow is harder,\u201d he added. \u201cWords like demilitarizing, disarming and de-radicalizing are just words without action. Every step will be filled with pitfalls. Every step will be contested by forces that do not support the Trump vision for peace. By Iran. By the Muslim Brotherhood. By the U.N. By others.\u201d",
      "As for the future, the Trump administration appears to have less of a blueprint than an aspiration. Last month, Trump released a 20-point peace plan that starts with ending the war in Gaza and ends with forging a broader peace between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "The first part is specific; the latter, vague. The 19th point says that certain conditions that include reconstruction of Gaza and political reform must be met and then, once that happens, \u201cthe conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d The authors set no hard deadlines or timetables for deciding the Palestinians\u2019 fate.",
      "At home, Trump is enmeshed in a government shutdown with no end in sight. But presidents enjoy far more latitude when it comes to foreign policy, and Trump appears to be savoring his achievement overseas.",
      "A senior administration official traveling with Trump on the quick trip to Israel and Egypt said of the president\u2019s mood: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen him so proud.\u201d",
      "Another official, back in Washington, said: \u201cEveryone is taking great pride in it and wants to be part of it. And it\u2019s an acute reminder that we can do the hard things.\u201d",
      "Trump tapped two confidants to negotiate the deal: his son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House envoy Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer. Both watched in the Knesset as Trump delivered an hour-long speech, relishing the moment and riffing in ways that made members laugh and applaud in surprise.",
      "\u201cTrump! Trump! Trump,\u201d lawmakers chanted. Some wore his signature piece of campaign memorabilia, a red hat with a twist that read: \u201cTrump, the Peace President.\u201d",
      "Seizing on the good will, Trump made a personal plea to help a friend. Netanyahu is facing trial on corruption charges. Trump went off script to beseech Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon the prime minister.",
      "\u201cThis man is a good man right here. I have an idea. Mr. President, why don\u2019t you give him a pardon?\u201d Trump said.",
      "Now that the fighting has stopped and the hostages have been returned, Trump's interest could potentially wane. As the leader with the most leverage in the region, Trump needs to stay involved to make progress on his vision of a transformed Middle East, foreign policy analysts said.",
      "For Trump, there is at least one clear incentive to stay engaged.",
      "He lost out on the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize last week, and his supporters are already lobbying for him to get the award next year.",
      "\"You have to wonder whether he stays with this,\" Miller, the former negotiator, said. \"That will depend primarily on whether there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: the elusive Nobel, which he believes he deserves.\""
