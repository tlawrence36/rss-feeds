      "The cast of \u201cConclave\u201d has accepted congratulations from generations of big stars backstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As the cast of \"Conclave\" descended steps leading to backstage at the Shrine Auditorium, they got a fresh round of applause from staff and crew at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to go with the big ovation they'd gotten moments earlier from the ballroom crowd.",
      "The esteemed group of Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow had enough collective gravitas on their own, but Harrison Ford, who had just presented them the best ensemble award, the night's big prize, also walked among them.",
      "He was among the generations of stars, including the night's other big winners and nominees, to congratulate the elite performers from the papal potboiler as they made their way through the behind-the-scenes winners' obligations at the SAG Awards, with an Associated Press reporter in tow.",
      "A photographer asked the \u201cConclave\u201d winners to stop and pose, and shouted \u201cGet in there Mr. Ford!\u201d",
      "Ford, not wanting to horn in, walked backwards up the steps back on to the stage.",
      "SAG staffers tried to lead the group to their next stop, but they had to wait. \u201cI have to go get my purse!\u201d Rossellini said, and returned to the ballroom. Lithgow went back in too to get his wife.",
      "A gleeful Jamie Lee Curtis descended on the two before they left and gave congrats and kisses to each.",
      "Fiennes walked ahead alone for a moment, and happened on Ariana Grande, whose cast of \u201cWicked\u201d had been up against \u201cConclave\u201d for best ensemble.",
      "'Yay, congratulations!\" she told Fiennes. \u201cI was really happy for you guys I was screaming!\"",
      "She then introduced him to her date, Broadway's \u201cSpongebob SquarePants\u201d actor Ethan Slater.",
      "Next came a station, normally a bar, where the actual SAG statuettes are handed out. (The ones they accept on stage are just props.)",
      "Jane Fonda, the night's winner of the guild's Lifetime Achievement Award, walked up.",
      "\u201cAre you guys just hanging out at the bar?\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI'm waiting for you, Jane Fonda!\u201d Fiennes replied.",
      "Fiennes pulled her aside and quietly praised the call-to-arms political speech she made during the show.",
      "\u201cYou nailed it,\u201d he said, adding that she expressed \u201cwhat no one is saying.\u201d",
      "Rossellini reappeared, gave a big hug to Fonda, and introduced her to the fourth \u201cConclave\u201d cast member in attendance, Sergio Castellitto, who played the vaping Cardinal Tedesco in the film.",
      "\u201cHe was the conservative,\u201d Rossellini said.",
      "\u201cI was the villain!\u201d Castellitto added.",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, winner of best male actor for \u201cA Complete Unknown,\" then showed up to get his statue.",
      "\u201cWhere's Timoth\u00e9e?\u201d Fiennes shouted.",
      "\u201cHey Ralph, how's it going, I was hoping I'd see you guys!\u201d Chalamet said.",
      "The wins for \u201cConclave\u201d and Chalamet threw a wrench into expectations for the Oscars that are just a week away, with Chalamet, Fiennes and Rossellini all nominees. The presumed Oscar frontrunner, \u201cAnora,\u201d was shut out.",
      "Lithgow returned to the group, and when Chalamet saw him he shouted, \u201cHey John, not bad eh?\"",
      "A photographer asked Lithgow to pose with his award, and he held up fingers to indicate this was his third.",
      "\u201cI don't want to boast, but..,\u201d he said with a shrug to the AP reporter.",
      "The group moved along and signed show posters, then made their way to the area where winners pose for press photos.",
      "Actors always say awards are heavy when they get them, but by all accounts the SAG statue truly is. Kieran Culkin made the heft the subject of half his acceptance speech for best supporting male actor.",
      "While he waited for the photo session, the 62-year-old Fiennes did some presses with his award with each arm.",
      "The 79-year-old Lithgow held his over his head with one arm as the photos were snapped.",
      "His wife of more than 40 years, UCLA business professor Mary Yeager, found a bench nearby to sit down after the long night.",
      "The group then stood for virtual questions from reporters at a news conference, and made their way into the official after-party, where they got their statuettes engraved.",
      "Before leaving with Yeager, Lithgow posed with a group of firefighters who had taken on the recent Los Angeles wildfires and had been the evening's special guests, getting a standing ovation when they were introduced before the show.",
      "The firefighters spent much of the night getting similar photos.",
      "During the first break in the telecast, they headed straight past Ford and Jeff Goldblum, who were standing and chatting, to the table where Grande sat with the \u201cWicked\u201d cast, perhaps looking to impress their children with the photos.",
      "They later made their way to Ford, who wanted to talk with them for a while before taking a picture.",
      "With only actors as nominees, the SAG Awards crowd has a high famous-to-not famous ratio, and behind the scenes it's easy to see things like best female actor winner Demi Moore talking to best male actor nominee Adrien Brody as they walk toward the restrooms. Both are also up for Oscars.",
      "The SAG Awards are also a union meeting, and this group, who went on a historic strike in 2023, were asked through fliers at place settings, a video that played during a break, and a pre-telecast plea from their leader to support their striking colleagues who work on video games.",
      "Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, also spoke of the need for legislation putting strict limits on the use of artificial intelligence to create actors' performances.",
      "\u201cAs I look out at our guests I see some of the most deep-faked people in the world,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

    "summary": "The great Roberta Flack has died",
    "story": [
      "The great Roberta Flack has died",
      "NEW YORK -- In an era where popular music is fluid, it is easy to forget the listening world was not always so open. Unless, of course, Roberta Flack's career is closely examined.",
      "Flack, whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday. She leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, \u201cFirst Take,\u201d wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach.",
      "Flack will likely be remembered for her classics \u2014 \u201cThe First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\u201d and \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\u201d among them. As she should be. But her talents extend well beyond the familiar titles.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist, here.",
      "Picking one standout from \u201cFirst Take\u201d is a fool's errand, but listeners would be wise to spend time with Flack's cover of the Leonard Cohen classic \u201cHey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye,\u201d a strong case for a reimagination eclipsing the original. Her voice transforms Cohen's lament. It's almost impossible to believe this song, let alone the entire record, was recorded over a period of just 10 hours at Atlantic Studios in New York in February 1969. But it was.",
      "Also from \u201cFirst Take\" is \u201cAngelitos Negros,\" performed entirely in Spanish by Flack. It's a song based on a poem by the Venezuelan writer Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco titled \u201cP\u00edntame Angelitos Negros,\" with a title lifted from the 1948 Mexican film of the same name.",
      "The movie navigates interracial relationships when a white couple gives birth to a dark-skinned child. Beyond Flack's soaring vocal performance \u2014 delivered atop a robust string section and nylon-string guitars \u2014 the song serves as an anthem against racial discrimination and a stunning example of the singer's cross-boundary approach to music making.",
      "As the well-documented lore suggests, Roberta Flack's mainstream success story begins when her dreamy cover of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger, was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \u201cPlay Misty for Me.\"",
      "It quickly topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. But her relationship with the song, and her singular ability to bring it to such great heights, was almost kismet. Before recording the ballad, she had real familiarity with it, having taught it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "It is Flack's best-known hit and one of the great love songs of the 20th Century. Flack first heard Lori Lieberman\u2019s \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\u201d while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience feel in love with it, too, as they'd continue to for decades.",
      "Her voice is otherworldly in her recording \u2014 pinpointing a kind of neo-soul R&B that would dominate for years to come \u2014 and she was recognized for it. Flack became the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record with this one.",
      "The song would win again in the \u201890s, when hip-hop trio the Fugees\u2019 would offer their masterful take on Flack's cover and introduce much of the world to singer Lauryn Hill's gift.",
      "A standard for R&B and jazz musicians alike \u2014 no doubt due to the grandeur of Flack's version \u2014 \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d is her third career No. 1. It's a mediative seduction, Flack embodying each lyrical vignette in her delivery. \u201cStrollin\u2019 in the park / Watchin\u2019 winter turn to spring,\u201d she opens the song, \u201cWalkin\u2019 in the dark / Seein\u2019 lovers do their thing.\u201d",
      "A soulful collaboration with her close friend Donny Hathaway, \u201cThe Closer I Get to You,\" is a reflective romance, both big-voiced and bigger-hearted singers lifting each other up. But despite its splendor, the song's legacy is marred in tragedy: In 1979, Flack and Hathaway started work on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "The '80s brought soft rock detouring for Flack, another experimentation for the innovative performer. \u201cTonight, I Celebrate My Love,\" a duet with the R&B balladeer Peabo Bryson, is at the intersection of a few genres and simultaneously timeless \u2014 a feat for a song anchored in shimmery, synthetized production.",
      "In her later career, Flack continued to meet the current moment. A great example is \u201cSet the Night to Music,\u201d a glossy pop song with English singer Maxi Priest. It was released on her 1991 album of the same name, which also features a then-contemporary cover of Philadelphia soul group The Stylistics' 1970s R&B hit \u201cYou Make Me Feel Brand New.\""

      "The 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night should offer the final clue in an unusually unpredictable Oscar race.",
      "The other major awards \u2014 including the BAFTAs, the Producers Guild Awards, the Directors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes \u2014 have all had their say. But actors make up the largest piece of the film academy pie, so their picks often correspond strongly with Academy Award winners.",
      "After wins from the PGA and the DGA \u2014 and last night, the Independent Spirit Awards \u2014 Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d is seen as the favorite to win best picture in a week\u2019s time at the Oscars. But Edward Berger\u2019s \u201cConclave\u201d won last weekend at the BAFTAs, the latest wrench in an award season full of them. That\u2019s included the unlikely rise and precipitous fall of another top contender, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "So there are plenty of questions heading into the SAG Awards, hosted by Kristen Bell from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Can \u201cWicked\u201d make a late push and win the guild\u2019s top award, best ensemble? Can Adrien Brody hold off Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for best actor? Can Mikey Madison keep the momentum and win best actress over Demi Moore?",
      "The 31st SAG Awards will be streamed live by Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An official pre-show will start an hour earlier, also on Netflix. Last year\u2019s show, the first to air on the streaming platform, drew an audience of 1.8 million, roughly on par with earlier SAG ceremonies broadcast by TNT and TBS.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d comes in the leading film nominee, with five nods, while \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d heads the TV categories.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s hit musical hasn\u2019t yet had a major awards win, but the Screen Actors Guild has often favored populist contenders. Also up for best ensemble are \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "The best actor and best actress categories should be nail biters. While Brody (\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d) has won a string of awards, Chalamet (\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d) and Ralph Fiennes (\u201cConclave\u201d) could easily pull off the upset. Best actress could go to either Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) or Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d).",
      "In the supporting categories, Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d) and Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) are the favorites.",
      "In addition to the competitive categories, Jane Fonda will be given the SAG Life Achievement Award.",
      "The devastating wildfires that began in early January forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and instead issue a press release. The guild has launched a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected by the fires. Producers have said the show will honor those affected."

      "\u201cBrave New World,\u201d the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn\u2019t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%.",
      "While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023\u2019s \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which fell 78%, and 2023\u2019s \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\u201d which dropped 70%.",
      "The Anthony Mackie-led \u201cCaptain America\u201d installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore. \u201cBrave New World,\u201d which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre-\u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d aura of invincibility.",
      "Still, \u201cBrave New World\u201d has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March.",

      "As it did with \u201cLonglegs,\u201d Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held Los Angeles\u2019 Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make.",
      "Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Unbreakable Boy\u201d opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease.",

      "Speaking to The Associated Press on the red carpet at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, the 26-year-old actor, who is trans, said she felt \u201cit was a good, necessary point\u201d to share. Schafer, also a presenter at the award show, was nominated for best lead performance for \u201cCuckoo. \u201d",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office instituting a new and narrow federal government definition of the sexes. As part of the order, the federal government defines sex as only male or female and says that must be reflected on official documents, like passports. The State Department, responsible for passports, is no longer issuing passports with the \u201cX\u201d marker that\u2019s been available since 2021 and is not honoring requests to change gender markers between \u201cM\u201d and \u201cF.\u201d",
      "In an 8 \u00bd-minute video posted to TikTok on Friday, Schafer, who transitioned as a young teen, said the passport that was meant to carry her well into her 30s was stolen while she was filming in Spain. After receiving an emergency passport, she later had to apply for a new, permanent one in Los Angeles. Having had female gender markers on her license and passport since she was a teenager, Schafer marked \u201cfemale\u201d on her application \u2014 but received a passport that identified her as male, she said. In the video, she said she had not had her birth certificate amended.",
      "Schafer acknowledged the executive order in her TikTok video: \u201cBecause our president, you know, is a lot of talk, I was like, \u2018I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u2019 And, today, I saw it,\u201d Schafer said, holding up her new passport page with the \u201cM\u201d marker. She said she was making the video not to \u201cfearmonger or like create drama or receive consolation,\u201d but to note the reality of the situation.",
      "\u201cI wasn't even really looking for support, but I have an amazing community around me and it's one of the greatest blessings of my life and so I felt very supported throughout, before and then now,\u201d she told the AP on Saturday.",
      "The State Department said in response to a request for comment that it was implementing Trump\u2019s executive order but declined to comment on specific cases, citing privacy laws and restrictions.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really change anything about me or my transness. However, it does make my life a little harder,\u201d Schafer said in the video, saying she has to travel for the first time with the new passport next week.",
      "\u201cTrans people are beautiful. We are never going to stop existing. I'm never going to stop being trans. A letter and a passport can't change that,\u201d she concluded.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",

      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",

      "NEW YORK -- The idea for a new TV show came to Craig Sweeny as he was driving. The producer and screenwriter, thinking about how to put his own stamp on a medical series, had to pull over when a familiar figure popped into his mind: Sherlock Holmes.",
      "Why not combine a hospital procedural with the lore of Britain's greatest detective? It would have a medical mystery every week and also tell stories of Holmes' good friend, Dr. John Watson. It was a mashup of two popular draws, the TV equivalent of peanut butter and jelly.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of each their own show-worthy premise in a way. And we\u2019re blessed to have both. So they compete for space in a really interesting way,\u201d says Sweeny.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s something really pleasurable about the self-contained, 43-minute procedural that gives you a beginning, middle and end, a little bit of a mystery and the fun of watching something get figured out,\u201d says Jonathan Tolins, a playwright, TV writer and showrunner. \u201cI think that the audience is so familiar with it that it does reward you if you come up with a sort of fun twist on it.\u201d",
      "Tolins' own current take on the procedural is CBS' \u201cElsbeth,\u201d which takes the quirky character Elsbeth Tascioni from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and plops her down in a \u201cColumbo\u201d-style police procedural.",
      "Elsbeth, played by Carrie Preston, is a sleuth in bright colors and a bucket hat, blunt and unpredictable, playing off the guest star of the week. Tolins says the writers and camera crew try not to make her feel like the show's lead, even though she's the very title.",
      "\u201cI said early on that I think the show works best when it feels like a CBS police procedural with Elsbeth thrown into it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about always keeping her sort of out of the center of the frame in wide shots.\u201d",
      "Another elevated procedural with a quirky lead character is ABC\u2019s \u201cHigh Potential,\u201d a police show starring a genius \u2014 but this time, she\u2019s a single mom of three who has an IQ of 160 and is played by Kaitlin Olson.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a unicorn,\u201d says Todd Harthan, executive producer and showrunner. \u201cYou throw a unicorn into the bullpen with a bunch of detectives and they go, \u2018What are we supposed to do with this colorful creature with the horn coming out of her head?\u2019\u201d",
      "Supercharging procedurals comes as streaming increasingly offers subscribers a highly curated selection of unconventional, relatively short series with big names and high production values.",
      "\u201cI think that, inevitably, the innovations that streaming is doing bleed into what happens in network TV and challenge what we\u2019re doing to compete for eyeballs in a healthy way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "Procedurals are often referred to as the comfort food of TV, offering a predictable, solvable hour with a familiar cast. So strong is our attachment to the form that streaming services have also been stretching their form with shows like the also \u201cColumbo\u201d-like \u201cPoker Face\u201d on Peacock and Max's \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which takes a medical show like \u201cER\u201d and breaks it down into different hours of a hospital shift, like \u201c24.\u201d",
      "Harthan believes the gap between the streaming and network may be closing as networks offer writers a bit of a longer leash to try different things and streaming looks enviously at the broad audiences that networks pull.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always sort of learning and trying to glean certain things from different shows that are very different than the one you\u2019re working on day-to-day,\u201d Harthan says. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the growth of doing what we do for a living.\u201d",
      "Showrunners caution that mixing different elements into a show to raise the level can't be done willy-nilly. The creator of \u201cWatson\u201d notes that its hero was already a doctor in the world of Sherlock Holmes, so making him head of a clinic makes sense.",
      "\u201cIt is an exotic combo, but it\u2019s also very organic,\u201d says Sweeny. \u201cMechanically you don\u2019t have to force anything into place. Everything\u2019s already there.\u201d",
      "A few years ago, the term \u201cgourmet cheeseburger\u201d was given to streaming shows that were both premium and commercial \u2014 take \u201cBridgerton\u201d \u2014 and network TV may be going through their own gourmet cheeseburger phase.",
      "\u201cThe more the two converge, the better,\u201d says Robert King. He and his wife, Michelle King, are the prolific creators of shows on networks (\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cEvil\u201d and \u201cElsbeth\u201d) and streaming (\u201cHappy Face\u201d).",
      "\u201cWe love working in both and we don\u2019t start with, \u2018Oh, we must do a network show,\u2019 or, \u2018We must do a streaming show.\u2019 It's very much, \u2018This idea we have fits more comfortably either in network or in streaming,\u2019\u201d says Michelle King.",
      "Robert King considers one of the greatest TV hybrids to be \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which mixed a comic premise with violence and put it into a serialized format. It was a hit for HBO but was originally pitched to a network, Fox.",
      "\u201cI do think the hybrid goes back to \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 at least and I\u2019m sure beyond that,\u201d he says.",
      "Tolins, who leads the \u201cElsbeth\u201d writing room, recently got some nice feedback about his elevated procedural skills. CBS did a focus group about the new season's premiere episode, which starred \u2014 spoilers \u2014 Nathan Lane as the killer of an obnoxious operagoer.",
      "\u201cOne of the women who saw it afterwards kept saying, \u2018This is network? I\u2019m going to have to watch more network television,\u2019 which of course was very, very satisfying for all of us listening,\u201d Tolins says."

He\u2019s only partially healed from a hand injury that\u2019s rendered him dependent on pills and unable to aim a gun as well as he used to. Dolinski also seems to be in the throes of a full crisis: We meet him not on the job, or even in flashback to his pre-injury glory, but out clubbing. The next morning, Dolinski emerges in a bathrobe to gaze proudly upon the several much younger women who have spent the night.",
      "But a room full of scantily clothed model-types who seem to be there willingly is only a temporary balm for poor Dolinski. While he might still be a viable specimen for the 20-something party girls of London, his game does not hold the same appeal in the workplace. Soon he\u2019ll be getting the dreaded \u201cwe\u2019re going younger\u201d talk from his boss, and she\u2019s talking about him, not his love interests. This is a guy who is certain he\u2019s got a lot left to give in the assassin game, and not as a mentor to a \u201chitman prodigy,\u201d as Cooper Hoffman\u2019s character Wihlborg is described.",
      "Is a familiar conceit like the wise veteran and the cocksure newcomer tired or a classic? Well, it\u2019s all in the execution. And \u201cOld Guy,\u201d stylishly filmed though it may be, is not one of the better attempts, likely hampered by the script from Greg Johnson. Generational clashes should be easy enough comedic fodder for a screenwriter and two capable actors, but here it lands with a thud. One likes to drink! The other doesn\u2019t even like to be around alcohol! The more serious ethical questions about hitman etiquette are similarly inelegant. Take this gem from Wihlborg: \u201cWhere I come from one does what one needs to do to survive. That includes killing a kid.\u201d",
      "Hoffman, so perfect leading \u201cLicorice Pizza,\u201d is not served well by this script, which never quite justifies why he\u2019s such a prodigy at such a young age and doesn\u2019t give him or Waltz any room to play off one another in a natural way. Waltz also can\u2019t seem to choose a lane with Danny, an eccentric hedonist with a soul who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to kill kids on the job. He\u2019s also working with his normal accent which is all well and good until the movie very unnecessarily introduces his Irish mother.",
      "And because action movies of this variety need a woman, Lucy Liu, who deserves much, much better than this (they all do, but mostly her), goes along for the ride. Her character Anata is the glamorous manager of a Soho karaoke bar that might also be a front for a brothel, but that\u2019s never really explored. What is deemed important here is that she\u2019s Dolinski\u2019s longtime confidante, and tags along on their mission to Belfast for\u2026wait for it\u2026a date. It\u2019s a very strange little subplot in which Anata does go to this date only to be broken up with. The guy she\u2019s been seeing is not connected to the larger plot in any way, except as the narrative push to have her ultimately fall in Dolinski\u2019s arms.",

      "A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show last week",
      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers.",
      "Many content creators, journalists and digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand the government\u2019s powers to regulate digital media content.",
      "\u201cI think we are facing a threat that this particular incident might be a trigger point for obscenity laws,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy analyst and founder of the tech website MediaNama.",
      "In Allahbadia's case, observers say the controversy was blown out of proportion and could lead to a chilling effect on India\u2019s comedy scene.",
      "\"The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere is a very strong determining factor that decides whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,\u201d said Anurag Minus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi.",
      "This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced police crackdowns or their shows being cancelled.",
      "Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's rule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons.",
      "In 2021, comedian Vir Das faced police complaints for his \u201cI Come from Two Indias\u201d show, which was critical of India over its fight against COVID-19, crimes against women and crackdowns on comedians. During his show, Das described India as a country where people \u201cworship women during the day but gang rape them at night.\u201d",
      "That same year comedians Munawar Faruqui and Nalin Yadav were arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian state that\u2019s ruled by Modi\u2019s party. Faruqui was jailed for a month."

      "According to Grammy Award-winner Chandrika Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries",
      "(RNS) \u2014 The winner of the 2025 Grammy Award for best new age, ambient or chant album \u2014 a category once dominated by Enya \u2014 was an album titled \u201cTriveni,\u201d meaning \u201cthe confluence of three rivers\u201d in Sanskrit, an apt description for its weaving of Vedic chants, melodic flute and cello by India\u2019s Chandrika Tandon, South Africa\u2019s Wouter Kellerman and Japan\u2019s Eru Matsumoto.",

The world\u2019s largest gathering of humanity, with 400 million people attending this year, the Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years, with this year\u2019s celebration, the Maha Kumbh Mela, happening only every 144 years, when the sun, the moon and Jupiter align.",

      "Tandon was a prominent business mogul for more than half her life, the namesake of New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and sister to former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. Twenty-five years ago, however, Tandon faced what she describes as a \u201ccrisis of spirit.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew I had everything, and yet I felt like I had nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I died today, what is it that I want to have accomplished? Is it just more money, more climbing up the ladder, or was there something else that would just give me happiness and make each day complete?\u201d",
      "That something else, she found, was devotional music. Pulling from the mantras she once heard as a little girl in Chennai, Tandon found a new purpose in creating melodies and \u201cpraying into the notes\u201d as a form of meditation. \u201cMusic helped me find myself,\u201d said Tandon, the creator of six albums of her own.",
      "And according to Tandon, the Grammy win signifies a larger cultural moment, helping young people all over the world discover the \u201cextraordinary gems\u201d of the ancient Vedic traditions. \u201cInstead of a traditional Indian ornate piece of jewelry, I\u2019ve simply put them in a completely Western jewelry setting,\u201d said Tandon. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s more apparent, it\u2019s more discernible, more relatable. And suddenly there\u2019s this curiosity about, \u2018What is that? It makes me feel so good!\u2019\u201d",
      "According to Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries. The 21st is no different, they say, as they see a burgeoning space for the spiritually curious youth seeking a respite from the fast-paced internet culture they grew up in. Now, a new generation of kirtan artists is leading the charge on Hindu sacred music.",
      "Amid confusing times, says devotional musician Gaura Vani, Generations Z and X have found a way to articulate their complicated emotions and feelings through the call-and-response style of kirtans, the devotional songs commonly associated with the Hare Krishna faith.",
      "\u201cThis is almost a miraculous thing to say, but in this world of social media and phone addiction and all that, the kids in the Krishna community are doing the craziest thing: Without anyone telling them to, they will find a weekend where everyone\u2019s free, they will dress to the nines together, and find a temple or a space where they will do kirtans for, like, 10 hours straight,\u201d he told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It makes no sense in the modern world, but they\u2019re doing it.\u201d",
      "Vani, born into an American Hare Krishna family, just performed his first solo live concert at Mumbai\u2019s Royal Opera House in late January. Once the head of the successful early 2000s \u201cKrishna-conscious\u201d rock band As Kindred Spirits, Vani joined musicians from the East and the West for a fusion of world music, mantra, pop and rock. \u201cIt\u2019s all about spiritual stories and spiritual music from around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my jam.\u201d",
      "Some form of singing or chanting takes place in almost every Hindu tradition, says Vani, but the bhakti, or devotional, tradition practiced by members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, places an emphasis on music as a way to connect with the Divine, and \u201cas a way to create harmony, peace in the world, peace in oneself and to heal both spiritually and physically.\u201d",
      "The Maha Mantra, a repetition of the words \u201cHare,\u201d or praise, \u201cKrishna\u201d and \u201cRama,\u201d set to any melody the singer, or kirtaniya, chooses, is an ISKCON staple. This Sanskrit call-and-response, with the names of God sung alongside a harmonium and a mridanga, a type of drum, says Vani, can lead participants to a \u201cflow state\u201d where it may feel like \u201cmusic is kind of descending from the heavens and coming out through you.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to ecstasy I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d said Vani.",
      "Steeped in this tradition since birth, Vani and his wife, a trained Indian classical dancer, have now surrounded their three teenage children with song and dance. But as Vani has taught his kids, spiritual meaning is not limited to kirtans: \u201cIf you look for it, spiritual music is all around us, in all cultures,\u201d he said, from gospel to Sufi Zikr to praise music from South Africa. And, says Vani, it\u2019s in his daily playlist of Nora Jones, George Harrison, the Talking Heads and The Police. (The latter\u2019s song \u201cSpirits in the Material World\u201d is, he said, a personal family favorite.)",
      "Premanjali Dejager, a 24-year-old \u201cKrishna kid\u201d \u2014 a term of endearment for those raised in a Hare Krishna household \u2014 lives in New York\u2019s Bhakti Center ashram and doesn\u2019t go a day without chanting the Maha Mantra a few times. The kirtaniya, who grew up in Australia, says kirtans can feel like a \u201cspiritual dance party,\u201d where \u201cteenage angst\u201d and \u201cclub dance moves\u201d meet in a safe, nondestructive environment.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the midst of it, like, when someone is really singing from their heart and, like, really connecting, you feel that sense of connection in the room,\u201d Dejager, who grew up in Australia, told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s just contagious.\u201d",
      "Dejager has sung around the world with her guru Indradyumna Swami, known as the Travelling Monk, since graduating gurukul, or \u201cspiritual high school,\u201d in 2018. But, she said, she wasn\u2019t always so musically inclined. \u201cI was actually a really terrible singer,\u201d she said, recalling that she was removed from her primary school\u2019s singing group because she \u201cjust couldn\u2019t sing on key.\u201d",
      "Yet taking singing lessons in jazz and pop music grew Dejager\u2019s confidence, and she started posting devotional singing videos on social media, some of them \u201creally cringy.\u201d Today, she has more than 50,000 Instagram followers and her own virtual kirtan school, where she has, since 2021, taught other aspiring singers over Zoom that what\u2019s important is \u201cbeing real,\u201d or coming as you are to the devotional practice.",
      "\u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m feeling really sad or going through something difficult or having to make a difficult decision, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a prayer offering of like, \u2018Krishna, I need your help here. I need your guidance.\u2019 And sometimes it does happen where I\u2019m having to catch myself from like spacing out, and my mind goes everywhere. It is a practice of constantly trying to bring the mind back and just trying to bring my heart into the picture.\u201d",
      "Nikita Bhasin, a California native, considers herself more spiritual than religious. A certified yoga instructor since the age of 17, Bhasin was raised attending and singing devotionals at the Kali Mandir in Laguna Beach \u2014 a common story of being \u201cdragged along by my family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI left all the kirtan stuff behind because I was older and I didn\u2019t have to do what my parents told me to do,\u201d Bhasin, 27, told RNS.",
      "But Bhasin eventually found her way back to the music, when she learned yoga from an instructor who began practice with the same chants she heard as a child, but in a \u201cmore digestible\u201d 10-minute format rather than the three hours she spent at the temple. She took up the harmonium and now opens and closes each of her yoga classes in New York, barring if they are in a gym setting, with a Sanskrit chant, often to the theme of the asanas, or postures, such as repeating \u201cJai Ma,\u201d or hail Mother Earth, in a class about \u201cbalancing opposition.\u201d",
      "Many of her students have never chanted before, holding varying beliefs (or no beliefs) about God, some coming only for the physical asanas of yoga. Bhasin invites them to \u201cput their own spin\u201d on the ancient practice.",
      "\u201cA lot of these chants, you are chanting to something higher than yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of interpretations of that. There\u2019s thousands of lineages that think of God or divine as something different: Divine could be a hug from your friend, or it could be feeling like you\u2019re not on autopilot and are grateful and connecting with people in your life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting, because a lot of people tell me after class that they haven\u2019t sung since they were like 10 years old, and this is how they\u2019re coming back to their body and coming back to this childlike spirit of just letting go,\u201d she said."

      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\u201cWith my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\u201d Wilson said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\u201d",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.5 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007 concluded with 2021's \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in the more than 50-year history of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting a new James Bond film. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theatres around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \u201cWe are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Oscars are more international than ever",
    "story": [
      "The Oscars are more international than ever",
      "NEW YORK -- For many filmmakers, the Oscars are a pipe dream. But not because they think their movies aren\u2019t good enough.",
      "The Iranian director, Mohammad Rasoulof, for instance, knew his native country was more likely to jail him than submit his film for the Academy Awards. Iran, like some other countries including Russia, has an official government body that selects its Oscar submission. For a filmmaker like Rasoulof, who has brazenly tested his country\u2019s censorship restrictions, that made the Oscars out of the question.",
      "\u201cA lot of independent filmmakers in Iran think that we would never be able to make it to the Oscars,\u201d Rasoulof said in an interview through an interpreter. \u201cThe Oscars were never part of my imagination because I was always at war with the Iranian government.\u201d",
      "Unlike other categories at the Academy Awards, the initial selection for the best international film category is outsourced. Individual countries make their submission, one movie per country.",
      "Sometimes that\u2019s an easy call. When the category \u2014 then \u201cbest foreign language film\u201d \u2014 was established, it would have been hard to quibble with Italy\u2019s pick: Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Strada,\u201d the category\u2019s first winner in 1957.",
      "But, often, there\u2019s great debate about which movie a country ought to submit \u2014 especially when undemocratic governments do the selecting. Rasoulof\u2019s fellow Iranian New Wave director Jafar Panahi likewise had no hopes of Iran selecting his 2022 film \u201cNo Bears\u201d for the Oscars. At the time, Panahi was imprisoned by Iran, which didn\u2019t release him until he went on a hunger strike.",
      "Rasoulof\u2019s film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d \u2014 a movie shot clandestinely in Iran before its director and cast fled the country \u2014 ultimately was nominated for best international film. But on March 2, it will be at the Oscars representing Germany, the country Rasoulof made his home in after being sentenced to flogging and eight years in prison in Iran.",
      "\u201cThe film, to a large degree, is now a German film, both because of the distribution company and because of all the people who worked on it post-production, including myself,\u201d said Rasoulof. \u201cI\u2019m a person who\u2019s been ripped of his Iranian national identity.\u201d",
      "The Oscars are more international than ever. This year's lead nominee, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d is the most nominated non-English language film ever. It\u2019s a Mexico-set, Spanish-language film shot outside Paris \u2014 a reflection of how borderless film can be. (It's France's Oscar submission.) For the seventh year in a row, a foreign-language film has been nominated for best picture. And for the first time, in fact, there are two up for Hollywood\u2019s top prize: \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and the Brazilian drama \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "The historic 2020 win for \u201cParasite,\u201d the first non-English language best picture winner, wasn\u2019t just, as director Bong Joon Ho called it then, a victory over \u201cthe one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles.\u201d It was the sign of a tectonic shift in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. To diversify its membership, the academy has in recent years invited hundreds of overseas voters, tipping the Oscar scales. The Academy Awards have gone global.",
      "And yet the Academy Awards' marquee category for international cinema, best international film, has been continually criticized as unjust, outdated and subject to political interference. \u201cThe Oscars\u2019 international film category is broken,\u201d wrote film critic Alissa Wilkinson in 2020 for Vox. \u201cNothing short of a total overhaul of the category is order,\u201d wrote Variety critic Peter Debruge in 2022.",
      "The academy has sometimes tweaked the category, which was renamed in 2020. In 2006, the academy ruled that international submissions no longer needed to be in the language of its home country. Last year\u2019s winner, \u201cThe Zone of Interest,\u201d was a German-language film set at Auschwitz, but marked the United Kingdom's first best international film Oscar.",
      "To help guard the process from outside influence, the academy in 2023 specified that each country\u2019s selection committees must be at least 50% composed of \u201cfilmmakers, artists and craftspeople.\u201d But who those people are, and what their subjective sense of national identity might be, has often been questionable.",
      "This year, one of the most conspicuous absences from the Oscars is Payal Kapadia\u2019s \u201cAll We Imagine As Light,\u201d an Indian drama that numerous critics have named the best film of 2024. It was the first Indian film to play in competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 30 years.",
      "The Film Federation of Indian instead chose Kiran Rao\u2019s \u201cLaapataa Ladies,\u201d a glossier comedy from Jio Studios that the academy ultimately passed on. FFI president Ravi Kottarakara told the Hollywood Reporter India that the jury, which was all male, felt \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d was like \u201cwatching a European film taking place in India.\u201d",
      "Kapadia, speaking shortly after that decision, praised the choice of \u201cLaapataa Ladies\u201d while taking issue with the jury\u2019s metric.",
      "\u201cWhat is Indian? It\u2019s a very big continent that we have,\u201d said Kapadia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Indias. I\u2019m really happy with the film they chose. It\u2019s a really nice film. I liked it a lot. But I feel like these kind of statements, I don\u2019t know what purpose they serve. The committee that made the selection was 13 men. Is that very Indian?\"",
      "Rancor over the Greek selection process led 20 filmmakers to withdraw their submissions for this year\u2019s Oscars to protest the Greece Ministry of Culture's sudden replacement of selection committee members.",
      "Renos Haralambidis, one of the filmmakers who withdrew his film, told Balkan Investigative Reporting Network: \u201cI believe that the committee that will choose which film will be nominated for the Oscars should be independent of the state, because I believe the less the state in art, the better.\u201d",
      "The question for the academy is: Does it want this annual drama in the international film category? Should governments, autocratic or not, have any say in what films are in the running for one of the most sought-after Oscars?",
      "The film academy declined to comment for this article.",
      "These are issues the Oscars have long been aware of. Sometimes, the academy has even lent a hand to a country making its first submission. That was the case when Bhutan established a selection committee so it could nominated Pawo Choyning Dorji\u2019s 2019 film \u201cLunana: A Yak in the Classroom.\u201d It surprised pundits and received an Oscar nomination, Bhutan\u2019s first.",
      "What options does the academy have? It could make its own international film selection committee, like those that exist in other categories, and remove governments completely from the process. Some have advocated for expanding the category to 10 nominees, like best picture, and doing away with the one-nation, one-movie rule. Another option: Keep the current system but allow for several academy committee-chosen slots so that political dissidents aren't ruled out.",
      "Such changes would surely be welcome news to those who believed France last year should have submitted Justine Triet\u2019s best picture-nominated legal drama \u201cAnatomy of a Fall,\u201d or India ought to have backed the Telugu-language smash \u201cRRR.\u201d Both picked up Oscars in other categories.",
      "Regardless, it\u2019s clear that geopolitics have increasingly made the best international film award at the Oscars almost as quarrelsome as the rest of our global existence.",
      "For any peace in the category, you\u2019d have to look to the Latvian entry, \u201cFlow,\u201d an animated animal parable nominated for both best international film and best animated film. While it\u2019s nominated by Latvia, it contains no language, at all, just a few meows and some barking.",

      "A representative for the estate of The Notorious B.I.G. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Notorious B.I.G., one of the rap\u2019s greatest performers, was shot to death at age 24 in Los Angeles in 1997. The case remains unsolved. He was survived by his wife, the musician and actress Faith Evans, and his two children, Christopher Jordan Wallace and T\u2019yanna Dream Wallace.",
      "Wallace was a dedicated keeper of the legacy of her son, born Christopher Wallace. When he first emerged on the scene as one of rap's most distinctive talents with songs that expertly detailed street life in Brooklyn, she labeled his music \u201cnoise.\u201d",
      "Since his death, his gift took on a new meaning for her. She told AP in 2017, 20 years after his death, \u201cI remembered my son said, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to my music.\u2019 And I never listened to his music. I heard it on the radio and it sounded good, because it was clean. But I said, \u2018You know what, I have to. I have to listen to that music.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I did.\"",
      "\u201cI cried so much that day just listening to the music. I remember I sat, I stood. I rested my head on the stereo and I just cried like a baby. And that was therapy for me. And I said, \u2018Oh my God \u2014 that was a talented young man to put those words together.\u2019 He had a beautiful voice. I love his voice,\u201d she continued.",
      "Wallace launched the Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation following her son's death, an organization that provides educational resources for children. In 2003, she honored mothers of other musicians who died untimely deaths \u2014 Aaliyah, Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopes, Tupac Shakur, Jam Master Jay, Big Pun, Big L and Freaky Tah \u2014 at \u201cB.I.G. Night Out,\u201d a benefit for the foundation.",
      "\u201cIt is our way of saying, \u2018Keep your head up,\u201d\u2019 Wallace told AP at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s the foundation\u2019s way just to let these parents know that we love them.\u201d",
      "She also took legal action on behalf of her son. In 2004, she dropped a wrongful-death lawsuit against a former suspect in the rap star\u2019s slaying \u2014 Amir Muhammad, aka Harry Billups. The 2002 lawsuit also named the city of Los Angeles and Muhammad\u2019s former college roommate, David A. Mack, a Los Angeles policeman. It accused Mack of hiring Muhammad to shoot the hip-hop artist and police of failing to investigate properly after a fellow officer came under suspicion.",
      "In 2021, Wallace worked as an executive producer on the Netflix documentary \u201cBiggie: I Got a Story to Tell,\" and told AP about her role in the public eye.",
      "\u201cThey never knew me. The public never knew me. I was thrust into this environment, I should say, after he passed away, because I\u2019m a very private person. Extremely private,\" she said. \"What he was doing out there, maybe I should have known. But honestly, I didn\u2019t.

      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France.

    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn\u2019t allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral",
      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades, and said the lack of fluoride showed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d have a patient come in without cavities or anything else like that, and I\u2019d say, \u2019You didn\u2019t grow up here. Where did you grow up?' ... because everybody here has lots of cavities!\u201d he said.",

      "That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far \u2014 and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth.",
      "The talks in Colombia known as COP16 yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature \u2014 say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants \u2014 to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters.",
      "But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done.",
      "The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework.",
      "\u201cMontreal was about the \u2018what\u2019 \u2014 what are we all working towards together?\u201d said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. \u201cCali was supposed to focus on the \u2018how\u2019 \u2014 putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,\u201d said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks \u201cAnd so now we\u2019re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.\u201d",
      "The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Qu\u00e9bec, Spain, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Participants will discuss establishing a \u201cglobal financing instrument for biodiversity\u201d intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money.",
      "Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really about how do we collect the money and how do we get it distributed fairly, get it to the ground where it\u2019s needed most, so that that\u2019s really the core issue,\u201d said Kruger.",
      "Oscar Soria, chief executive of The Common Initiative, a think tank specializing in global economic and environmental policy, was pessimistic about raising a great deal more money.",
      "\u201cWe are completely off track in terms of achieving that money,\u201d Soria said. Key sources of biodiversity finance are shrinking or disappearing, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat was supposed to be a good Colombian telenovela in which people will actually bring the right resources, and the happy ending of bringing their money, could actually end up being a tragic Italian opera, where no one actually agrees to anything and everyone loses,\u201d Soria said.",
      "Susana Muhamad, Colombia's former environment minister and the COP16 president, said she's hopeful of \u201ca good message from Rome.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat message is that still, even with a very fragmented geopolitical landscape, with a world increasingly in conflict, we can still get an agreement on some fundamental issues,\" Muhamad said in a statement. \"And one of the most important is the need to protect life in this crisis of climate change and biodiversity.\u201d",
      "Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to an October report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London.",

      "Chandler said deforestation in the Amazon has far-reaching impacts across South America, just as it does in the Congo Basin and other major biodiverse regions worldwide.",

      "Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for \u201ca medical purpose involving another individual\u201d and he intentionally targeted the workers there.",

      "A court battle is set to resume over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding",
      "BOSTON -- A court battle is set to resume Friday over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding that many scientists say will endanger patients and delay new lifesaving discoveries.",
      "A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily blocked the cuts from taking effect earlier this month in response to separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide.",
      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries. Now U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, must decide whether to extend the temporary restraining order blocking those cuts.",
      "The states and research groups say such a move is illegal, pointing to bipartisan congressional action during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term to prohibit it.",
      "\u201cYet here we are again,\u201d attorneys argued in a court motion, saying the NIH is \u201cin open defiance\u201d of what Congress decreed.",
      "In its own written arguments, the Trump administration said NIH has authority to alter the terms after awarding grants and that Kelley\u2019s courtroom isn\u2019t the proper venue to arbitrate claims of breach of contract.",
      "States and researchers \u201chave failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury,\u201d according to the administration motion.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded more than 60,000 grants last year totaling about $35 billion. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \u201cindirect\u201d costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \u201coverhead\u201d but universities and hospitals argue they\u2019re far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Different projects require different resources. Labs that handle dangerous viruses, for example, require more expensive safety precautions than a simpler experiment. So currently each grant\u2019s amount of indirect costs is negotiated with NIH, some of them small while others reaching 50% or more of the total grant.",
      "If the new policy stands, indirect costs would be capped at 15% immediately, for already awarded grants and new ones. NIH calculated that would save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "A motion filed earlier this week cited a long list of examples of immediate harm in blue states and red states. They included the possibility of ending some clinical trials of treatments at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, that could leave \u201ca population of patients with no viable alternative.\"",
      "Officials at Johns Hopkins University were more blunt, saying the cut would end or require significantly scaling back research projects potentially including some of the 600 NIH-funded studies open to Hopkins patients.",
      "\u201cThe care, treatments and medical breakthroughs provided to them and their families are not \u2018overhead,\u2019\u201d university president Ron Daniels and Hopkins Medicine CEO Theodore DeWeese wrote to employees.",
      "Attorneys also argued the cuts would harm state economies. The University of Florida would need to cut \u201ccritical research staffing\u201d by about 45 people, while construction of a new research facility in Detroit expected to create nearly 500 new jobs could be paused or even abandoned, they wrote.",
      "\u201cImplementing this 15% cap will mean the abrupt loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that are already committed to employing tens of thousands of researchers and other workers, putting a halt to countless lifesaving health research and cutting-edge technology initiatives,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

    "story": [
      "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Florence Makumene held a plastic container of HIV medication and wondered if it would be her last as fears swelled of a return to a time decades ago when millions across sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS.",
      "As a young adult in Zimbabwe, Makumene watched loved ones succumb to a diagnosis of HIV that was viewed back then as a death sentence. But the 53-year-old didn\u2019t have to suffer the same fate when she tested positive in 2016. A community group funded by the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, ensured she enrolled in lifesaving treatment.",
      "\u201cPeople around me, including my own children, had written me off and were preparing to bury me, but I bounced back stronger,\u201d Makumene said.",
      "PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives and helping change the course of AIDS globally since being introduced in 2003. But the 90-day freeze on foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump effectively halted one of the world\u2019s most successful responses to a disease, although his administration subsequently promised waivers to keep lifesaving treatment going. A judge has ordered the administration to lift the freeze.",
      "In Africa, thousands of U.S.-funded health workers have been laid off and clinics have closed, restricting access to HIV testing and treatment. African health officials and experts have pleaded for PEPFAR to resume, fearing services that have become a key part of the health care system will be stripped in a way that sets countries back decades.",
      "\u201cPeople are finding doors closed. They are desperate,\u201d said Simon Bwanya of the Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV.",
      "Globally, AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 69% since the peak in 2004 and new HIV infections have been reduced by 60% since 1995, according to the United Nations AIDS program. Many experts see PEPFAR, which was introduced by Republican President George W. Bush, as a key part of that turnaround, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the most severely affected region.",
      "\u201cPEPFAR is the most efficient deployment of health resources I have seen,\u201d said professor Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, who has worked in the HIV sector in South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, for more than 20 years. \u201cI challenge anyone to tell me how we could have used the money better.\u201d",
      "PEPFAR\u2019s focus is Africa and the vast majority of lives have been saved there, largely through a program that helps get medication that keeps HIV in check to millions of people. Now their ability to keep taking that medication is in peril.",
      "The nongovernmental organization that helps Makumene has been closed for weeks, as has almost every PEPFAR-funded NGO across Africa while their fates are decided in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe are like orphans; we have no one to turn to,\u201d said Makumene, who has a small stockpile of medication. \u201cI fear we might be going back to the old days when being HIV (positive) was equated with death.\u201d",
      "She is one of some 20 million people worldwide who receive antiretroviral medications, or ARVs, with PEPFAR help. The drugs keep HIV from spreading in the body. Stopping them lets the virus start multiplying again and could lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.",
      "\u201cHIV is a simple disease,\u201d Venter said. \u201cYou stop your ARVs, you get AIDS.\u201d",
      "Without the drugs, HIV can rise again to detectable levels in a person's blood, increasing the chance of its spread.",
      "United Nations AIDS program Executive Director Winnie Byanyima told The Associated Press in an interview that the funding freeze could bring a surge in AIDS and has caused \u201cpanic, fear and confusion\u201d in many African countries.",
      "PEPFAR funds thousands of NGOs but also directly supports countries\u2019 public health systems \u2014 in many cases, by paying the salaries for tens of thousands of health workers who are part of the national HIV programs.",
      "In South Africa, PEPFAR pays for 15,000 HIV-specialist health workers in government hospitals and clinics. They represent just 5% of the total number of health workers in South Africa\u2019s HIV response program but are crucial components: doctors and nurses providing ARVs, social workers and counselors, along with community-based workers reaching people far from hospitals and clinics. Removing them breaks the system.",
      "\u201cCritical health care infrastructure is being dismantled, clinics forced to close, frontline workers without support, all while lives hang in the balance,\u201d said Sibongile Tshabalala, chairperson of the Treatment Action Campaign, one of a coalition of HIV advocacy groups that have come together since the funding freeze.",
      "The coalition said basic HIV services, including testing and treatment, were \u201ccrumbling\u201d in one of the country\u2019s main hospitals in Johannesburg.",
      "The South African government said it is looking at plans to avert a crisis by finding money to keep the health workers in place. Other African countries face even bigger problems.",
      "In Kenya, more than 40,000 workers face being laid off after the aid freeze, officials said. In Lesotho, a small, poor nation in southern Africa, 1,500 health workers \u2014 about 7% of the country's entire health staff \u2014 have already been dismissed. Lesotho's Health Ministry has asked final-year medical students and recent graduates to volunteer at local health centers to stand in for them.",
      "On Jan. 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced waivers to keep lifesaving treatment and other parts of PEPFAR going. Rubio has said he is a \u201csupporter of PEPFAR\u201d \u2014 though he has some questions about it \u2014 and the Trump administration wants to see it continue.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily lift the foreign funding freeze and rejected the argument that the administration was offering waivers to allow some funding to keep flowing. The judge cited testimony that no such waiver system yet existed.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides much of PEPFAR's funding, and aid groups say they know of no payments getting through for that or any program.",
      "Experts and health activists have also criticized the content of the waivers published by the Trump administration, which restrict access to treatment for some.",
      "As well as ARVs, PEPFAR funds pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a newer preventive medication.

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:48:30 -0500",
    "summary": "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was &ldquo;no pain, no gain.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d",
      "If you ever turned on the TV in the 2000s after midnight, you might have seen an informercial for P90X.",
      "The exercise program promised shredded abs and bulging biceps for anyone who pushed themselves to their limits for 90 days of 90-minute workouts. So it may come as a surprise that its creator, Tony Horton, now preaches the benefits of rest and warns against overtraining.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d said Horton, who had spent the \u201990s training celebrities. \u201cBack then it was all about warm-ups and cool-downs, and telling them to eat better and get off the hooch.\u201d",
      "His evolution reflects a broader shift in the exercise industry away from a \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d mentality that once dominated but often led to injury. Instead, the current buzzword in fitness is \u201crecovery.\u201d",
      "Horton \u2014 who at 66 still exudes a boyish exuberance \u2014 noted that P90X did include recovery days with stretching and low-impact movement such as yoga. But these days, he prioritizes mindfulness as much as exercise, and the time between workouts is filled with plenty of good sleep, plunges in frigid water baths, using foam rollers on tight muscles, relaxing in a sauna, and other activities in the name of recovery.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the recovery and the rest part right, then you\u2019re never going to be able to be consistent with the fitness end of things,\u201d Horton said.",
      "Before Horton, Jane Fonda had pushed home exercisers to \u201cfeel the burn,\u201d while bodybuilders lifted weights to the point of muscle failure. Now, the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, two of the largest organizations certifying personal trainers, emphasize recovery methods.",
      "NASM\u2019s \u201cFitness and Wellness\u201d certification includes training in \u201cholistic health and wellness including physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.\u201d",
      "The industry has learned from research that shows the benefit of proper rest, said Stan Kravchenko, founder of the OneFit personal training platform. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscle tissue, and studies show that well-rested people perform better and are less likely to get injured.",
      "But rest is only part of recovery. Kravchenko said personal trainers used to focus only on specific exercises a client could do during their workout. Now, they\u2019re more like life coaches who also give exercise advice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more about your lifestyle, how you eat, how you sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you stressed? What do you do for living? Are you working from a desk? So it\u2019s taking a little bit more like a broad approach.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d motto is great for athletes who can handle intense workouts and are looking to get stronger, but not everyone needs to push themselves that hard, Horton said. It depends on the goal.",
      "Michael Zourdos, chair of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, said lifting weights \u201cuntil failure\u201d may build bigger muscles, but isn\u2019t needed to increase strength. \u201cThere is a difference between training for health and training for elite performance benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "To realize the health benefits of a workout, it\u2019s still necessary to push yourself, Horton said: \u201cIn the muscles, the lungs, your heart, there\u2019s gotta be a certain amount of strain.\u201d",
      "There is a big difference, however, between discomfort and acute pain. If discomfort crosses into sharp pain in joints, tendons or muscles, stop that movement.",
      "People\u2019s needs vary depending on their goals and bodies. But Kravchencko offered a few general guidelines:",
      "For lifting weights, he recommends allowing 48 hours of recovery time per muscle group, and doing a maximum of 10 sets per muscle group per week. During the workout, he said, it\u2019s best to rest for two to three minutes between sets, as opposed to old advice to wait only a minute before exercising the same muscles.",
      "In between workouts, it\u2019s not necessary to stay still.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to do walking, jogging, very light yoga, stretching, pilates, core exercises,\u201d Kravchencko said. \u201cThat\u2019s all fine, because it\u2019s not specifically targeting the areas you\u2019ve targeted before.\u201d",
      "Horton and Kravchencko both mentioned a recovery practice not typically associated with weightlifting \u2014 meditation. Taking a few quiet minutes every morning helps you deal with the physical and emotional stress of life that can get in the way of wanting to exercise, they said.",
      "Horton recommends establishing a mindfulness routine even before formalizing an exercise plan because it will lay the groundwork to be consistent.",
      "\u201cWhat is your strategy to get to get healthy and to get fit and to stay that way?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with letting the pendulum swing the other way.\u201d",

    "title": "Is spending all day on your feet at work an occupational hazard?",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:56:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker&rsquo;s body",
    "story": [
      "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker\u2019s body",
      "NEW YORK -- While traveling in Europe, Margaux Lantelme noticed something different about the store cashiers: they did their work sitting down. It was a stark contrast to Chicago, where Lantelme works the register at REI and cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.",
      "For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She's still waiting for final approval.",
      "\u201cNot having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,\u201d Lantelme said. \u201cI personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.\u201d",
      "Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.",
      "Being on one's feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.",
      "The association recommends trying \u201cfatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,\u201d said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.",
      "Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.",
      "Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. \u201cIt takes a really hard toll on the knees,\u201d she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn\u2019t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.",
      "She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she'd been on her feet for five hours without a break.",
      "Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ortiz said.",
      "Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. \"Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,\" company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. \"This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.\u201d",
      "Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan's Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.",
      "\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been at the job, I\u2019ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we\u2019re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,\u201d bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. \u201cBeing able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I\u2019m doing things on the computer while I\u2019m at the registers.\u201d",
      "Spiegel\u2019s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it\u2019s hard for him to predict what days he\u2019ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.",
      "\u201cThere have been days that I\u2019ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it\u2019s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller\u2019s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president.",
      "During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. \u201cThe employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d",
      "In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Women were seen as the \u201cmothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,\u201d Boris added. \u201cAlmost every state had laws, but they weren\u2019t enforced.\u201d",
      "Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women's movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.",
      "Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. \u201cThe English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,\" Boris said.",
      "In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.",
      "Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with \u201cright to sit\u201d laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn\u2019t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.",

    "story": [
      "Vatican officials said that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery",
      "LONDON -- Vatican officials said late Tuesday that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a mix of infections in his respiratory tract.",
      "On Wednesday, the Vatican said Pope Francis \u201chad a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d saying he was in good spirits. Here\u2019s a look at what a pneumonia diagnosis can mean and potential treatments doctors might be trying:",
      "Pope Francis was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemilli hospital in \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after his bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, or a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms were growing in his respiratory tract.",
      "Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest scan showed he had developed pneumonia in both lungs, requiring additional medication.",
      "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in the lung, known as the bronchial tubes, become inflamed, leading to coughing and mucus production. That infection can sometimes spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that's typically caused by an infection.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in anyone can be serious, but for someone of the pope\u2019s age, it\u2019s particularly worrying.",
      "\u201cOne of the risk factors for more serious infection, like older age, meaning anyone over 65,\u201d said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Even though the pope lost part of his right lung decades ago, McCormack said that shouldn\u2019t necessarily compromise his recovery, adding that she would be more concerned about any possible signs of weakness in His Holiness.",
      "\u201cBeing a more frail older person can increase your risk of having complications,\u201d she said, noting that having to use a wheelchair could be considered a sign of frailty. The pope has relied on a wheelchair for more than two years.",
      "It appears, however, that the pope is not bed-bound. He has been able to get out of bed and his heart function is good, according to a Vatican official.",
      "Beyond antibiotic drug therapy, there are multiple treatments available, including supplemental oxygen and therapies to support the lungs and body while it\u2019s trying to recover.",
      "Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospital in Britain, said steroids and antibiotics would be the core elements of the pope\u2019s care, alongside nursing care and chest physiotherapy.",
      "Physiotherapy can help patients clear the fluids building up in their lungs, particularly if they aren\u2019t very mobile themselves.",
      "McCormack of Johns Hopkins said that severe cases of pneumonia were typically treated for about one to two weeks but that recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "Mainly, they\u2019ll be hoping that the pope\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t deteriorate further.",
      "\u201cWhile we give antibiotics and other therapies, we\u2019re waiting for the body to respond,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cIf he just stays as he is while he\u2019s fighting off the infection and has a gradual recovery, that lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign.\u201d",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, said that antibiotics typically need the lungs to be working to recover from infections, including pneumonia, but the ability of lungs to recover diminishes with age.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone has pneumonia, there\u2019s a good chance we can treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is also one of the leading causes of death. And so there are also situations where, despite our best efforts, we cannot clear the infection.\u201d",

      "A Philippine village in the densely populated capital region has launched a battle against dengue by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive.",
      "The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection.",
      "At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected.",
      "A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal de-clogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle.",
      "\u201cThere was an alarm,\u201d Cernal told The Associated Press. \u201cI found a way.\"",
      "Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said.",
      "Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases.",
      "As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents).",
      "\u201cThis is a big help,\u201d Labag said, smiling. \u201cI can buy coffee.\u201d",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical.",
      "Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes.",
      "Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it\u2019s crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said.",
      "Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours."

      "New York is suing several large electronic cigarette distributors for allegedly selling vaping flavors that can appeal to children",
      "New York on Thursday sued some of the country\u2019s biggest distributors of electronic cigarettes, accusing the companies of violating state laws that prohibit the sale of vaping flavors and designs that appeal to children.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James announced the lawsuit targeting middlemen that distribute fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and Elf Bar to hundreds of convenience stories and gas stations across the state. The approach differs from past litigation by New York and other states, which targeted vaping manufacturers, such as Juul Labs.",
      "Widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend, Juul has paid more than $1 billion to settle dozens of state and local lawsuits and investigations into its early marketing practices, which included launch parties and product giveaways. The company stopped selling flavors like mango and mint in 2019 and is no longer popular with teens.",
      "Instead, Chinese-made disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar have become the top choice among high school and middle school students. None of the products are approved by federal health regulators but they continue shipping into the U.S., often mislabeled as batteries, cell phones or other products.",
      "The state\u2019s nearly 200-page legal complaint points to \u201cwidespread evidence of illegal conduct, including documents showing illegal shipments of flavored vapes to New York.\u201d The filing also includes photos of brightly colored e-cigarettes that resemble soft drinks and candy and come in flavors like \u201cfruity bears freeze,\u201d \u201ccotton candy,\u201d and \u201cstrawberry cereal donut milk.\u201d",
      "New York banned all vaping flavors other than tobacco in 2020.",
      "\u201cFor too long, these companies have disregarded our laws in order to profit off of our young people, but we will not risk the health and safety of our kids,\u201d James said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the companies, as well as a permanent ban on their sales of flavored vapes in New York.",
      "In 2022 litigation, the co-founder of Buffalo-based Demand Vape told a federal judge that his company had sold more than $132 million worth of Elf Bar e-cigarettes in the past year. The company that makes Elf Bar is based in Shenzhen, China, and sells flavors including \u201cstrawberry mango\u201d and \u201clemon mint.\u201d",
      "Despite the continued availability of disposable e-cigarettes, the vaping rate among U.S. teens has fallen to a 10-year low of under 6%, according to federal figures released last year. Government health officials attribute the drop to more aggressive U.S. enforcement, including hundreds of warning letters sent to retail stores selling unauthorized vaping products.",

      "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.",
      "Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID\u2019s funding means Nyumbani\u2019s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s order seeks to review almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.",
      "For children at Nyumbani Children's Home, it's a life and death situation.",
      "As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers\u2019 faces.",
      "The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It's a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy \u2014 who has been looking after children here for 28 years \u2014 is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.",
      "\u201cWhen we started caring for them, they didn\u2019t look like they had life in them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\"",
      "When Nyumbani, which means \u201cHome\u201d in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.",
      "The 2003 inception of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR\u2019s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.",
      "\u201cUSAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,\u201d said Palakudy. \u201cWe put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.\u201d",
      "Over the last two decades, the U.S government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.",
      "USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.",
      "Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.",
      "According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.",
      "Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.",
      "The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.",
      "With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.",
      "\u201cThe future is uncertain,\u201d said Wamboye. \u201cThe Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.\u201d",
      "According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.",
      "One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. \u201cI had a very weak immune system,\" she said. \"This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.\u201d",
      "Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,\u201d she said.",
      "On average, the children's home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.",
      "Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it\u2019s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 09:33:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials",
    "story": [
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials",
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the U.S. program that helps low-income families pay for nutritious food has been tried before \u2014 but it may soon get a boost from new Trump administration officials.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed health and human services secretary, and Brooke Rollins, the new agriculture secretary, have both signaled that they favor stripping such treats from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "Kennedy has been most vocal, calling for the government to stop allowing the nearly $113 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans to use benefits to pay for \u201c soda or processed foods.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe one place that I would say that we need to really change policy is the SNAP program and food stamps and in school lunches,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week. \u201cThere, the federal government in many cases is paying for it. And we shouldn't be subsidizing people to eat poison.\u201d",
      "In one of her first interviews after being confirmed, Rollins said she looked forward to working with Kennedy on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhen a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children who perhaps need something more nutritious?\u201d Rollins said. \u201cThese are all massive questions we're going to be asking and working on in the coming months and years.\u201d",
      "But removing certain foods from SNAP \u2014 known for years as food stamps \u2014 isn't as simple as it sounds.",
      "The program is run by the USDA, not HHS, and is administered through individual states. It is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used for \u201cany food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law \u2014 or for states to get waivers that would let them restrict purchases, said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group. Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for bottled water, soda, chips, ice cream, decorated cakes and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "\u201cNone of those requests have ever been approved under either Republican or Democratic presidents,\u201d Bergh said.",
      "In the past, Agriculture Department officials rejected the waivers, saying in a 2007 paper that no clear standards exist to define foods \u201cas good or bad, or healthy or not healthy.\u201d In addition, the agency said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly. And they might not change recipients' food purchases or reduce conditions such as obesity.",
      "Anti-hunger advocates point to research that shows SNAP recipients are no more likely than other low-income Americans to buy sugary drinks or snack foods. And they say that limiting food choices undermines the autonomy and dignity of people who receive, on average, about $187 per month \u2014 or about $6.16 per day, according to latest figures.",
      "\u201cThis is just another way to cut benefits,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cIt's like, how do we restrict people more? How do we stigmatize them more?\u201d",
      "Bills are pending in Congress and in several states to restrict SNAP benefits from paying for soda, candy and other items.",
      "Rep. Josh Breechan, an Oklahoma Republican, sponsored the Healthy SNAP Act.",
      "\u201cIf someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Don\u2019t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.\u2019\u201d",
      "One SNAP recipient said she uses her monthly $291 benefit to buy necessities such as meat, oil, milk and coffee. Martina Santos, 66, of New York City, supplements those foods with fresh vegetables and fruits from a pantry run by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, where she's also a volunteer. Because she has diabetes and other health conditions, she said she understands the importance of using the benefits only for nutritious options.",
      "\u201cFor me, SNAP is to be used toward healthy food to get people to avoid all the disease they\u2019re having around right now: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d Santos said.",
      "In Kansas and elsewhere, bills that would ban soft drinks and candy highlight some of the challenges of such changes.",
      "Several pending bills seek to keep SNAP from paying for soft drinks, but they would continue to allow drinks containing milk, milk alternatives like soy or almond milk, or drinks with more than 50% vegetable or fruit juice. Candy is characterized as any unrefrigerated, flourless preparation of \u201csugar, honey or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops or pieces.\u201d",
      "By that definition, Kit Kat and Twix bars, which contain flour, wouldn't be banned. And juices that contain high amounts of sugar, but are more than half fruit juice by volume, would be allowed.",
      "Such conundrums have stymied changes to the SNAP program for decades. But this moment could be different, said Dr. Anand Parekh, chief medical officer of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.",
      "The momentum behind Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement could spur a new focus on solutions to poor diets that account for leading risk factors for early disease and death.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about the SNAP program, we have to remind people that the \u2018N\u2019 stands for nutrition,\u201d Parekh said. \u201cIt's about time that both parties can come together and see what are the innovations here to improve diet quality and nutrition.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An unusual series of military exercises by Chinese warships in the sea between Australia and New Zealand has prompted reproval from leaders in both countries about the amount of warning given",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Leaders in Australia and New Zealand say China should have given them more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live fire exercises in the seas between the two countries, forcing flights to divert on short notice.",
      "The drills by three naval ships happened in international waters beneath a busy commercial flight path over the Tasman Sea on Friday and Saturday, and at least once involved live fire.",
      "There's no suggestion China broke any laws, but analysts say the episode highlights escalating regional tensions over China's influence.",
      "The Tasman Sea spans 1,200 miles (2,000 km) between Australia and New Zealand, the largest Western powers in the South Pacific Ocean. Australia\u2019s government said Thursday that three Chinese warships were sailing unusually close to its shores on an undeclared mission.",
      "The Chinese military task group were in Australia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, the area beyond its territorial waters where a nation has exclusive economic rights. That was \u201cnot unprecedented, but unusual,\u201d Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said.",
      "But on Friday, commercial flights between Australia and New Zealand hurriedly diverted after the Chinese vessels warned pilots they were flying above a live firing exercise.",
      "Live fire from the warships hasn\u2019t been confirmed during Friday\u2019s drills, but firing was spotted by a New Zealand navy ship tracking the vessels on Saturday.",
      "Political leaders from both countries emphasized that China didn\u2019t breach international law, but said the warships should have given more notice before conducting live fire exercises.",
      "The activities also raised eyebrows because they happened further south than usual.",
      "The live fire activities happened on \u201ca couple of hours\u2019 notice\u201d rather than the expected 12 to 24 hours, New Zealand\u2019s Defense Minister Judith Collins told Radio New Zealand on Monday. China was not required by law to give that much advance warning, but after planes scrambled to divert, Collins said officials were \u201cseeking assurance from the Chinese embassy\u201d about future activities.",
      "She said she did not know what the Chinese military planned for the vessels in the coming days. Leaders said there was no danger to either country and stopped short of criticizing China for undertaking the activities.",
      "China is the biggest export partner for both Australia and New Zealand, and the episode follows a period of improved ties between Beijing and Canberra as a Chinese trade freeze on many Australia goods has gradually thawed.",
      "But the latest developments could force the Australian government to rethink its celebration of success on China said Michael Shoebridge, a former Australian defense and security official and director of the think tank Strategic Analysis Australia.",
      "\u201cIf the Australian Prime Minister admits that this stabilization of the Australia-China relationship has done nothing to stop China\u2019s growing aggression towards our military in the wider region, it undercuts their signature foreign policy achievement,\" he said.",
      "Chinese officials vehemently rejected the suggestion that the military didn\u2019t warn of their activities. China\u2019s Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said Sunday that the vessels \u201crepeatedly issued safety notices in advance.\u201d",
      "Australian leaders had \u201cmade unreasonable accusations against China and deliberately hyped it up,\u201d Wu said.",
      "Shoebridge said China's annoyance about Australia's growing military ties in Asia might be one reason for the maneuvers. Bolstered security ties with Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam, all three of which have territorial disputes with China, have increased Australia\u2019s presence in the region's waters.",
      "Beijing is seeking to isolate those countries at a time of flux in global relations and ratcheting tension between China and Taiwan, the analyst said.",
      "But many also suggested the drills were a demonstration of the Chinese navy\u2019s growing size and capabilities in a region where Beijing is ambitious for a larger presence.",
      "China has keenly sought security deals with small island nations throughout the South Pacific, raising anxiety in Wellington and Canberra about the prospect of fierce territorial contest in their backyards. That's provoked backlash from Pacific leaders, who resent scrutiny of their diplomacy by Australia and New Zealand.",
      "\u201cAnyone who thought there wasn\u2019t a downside to building a military relationship with China now knows that isn\u2019t true,\u201d said Shoebridge. \u201cThe last thing anyone in the South Pacific should want is the Chinese military bringing the tension and aggression they\u2019ve brought to Southeast Asia and North Asia to our local neighborhood.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 08:18:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Germany faces its second change of leader in less than four years after the head of the center-right opposition won Sunday&rsquo;s election",
    "story": [
      "Germany faces its second change of leader in less than four years after the head of the center-right opposition won Sunday\u2019s election",
      "BERLIN -- Germany faces its second change of leader in fewer than four years after the head of the center-right opposition, Friedrich Merz, won Sunday's election, which saw a surge for a far-right party and a stinging defeat for outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",
      "After the collapse of Scholz's three-party government in November, it's now up to Merz to restore stability to the European Union's most populous country and traditional political heavyweight, which also has the continent's biggest economy.",
      "Merz has one realistic option to form a government: a coalition with Scholz's Social Democrats. His Union bloc and its center-left rival have a combined 328 seats in the 630-seat parliament.",
      "He says he hopes to do the deal by Easter. That's a challenging timeframe: The possible partners will have to reconcile contrasting proposals for revitalizing the economy, which has shrunk for the past two years, and for curbing irregular migration \u2014 an issue that Merz pushed hard during the campaign. That will likely require diplomacy and a readiness to compromise that often weren't evident in recent weeks.",
      "It's still a much easier task than it might have been. For hours on Sunday night, it looked likely that Merz would need to add a second center-left partner, the environmentalist Greens, to put together a parliamentary majority.",
      "The Union and Social Democrats were post-World War II Germany's heavyweights. But their support has been eroding for at least two decades as the political landscape has become more fragmented. Their combined showing Sunday was their weakest since the postwar federal republic was founded in 1949.",
      "The Social Democrats had their worst postwar showing with just 16.4% of the vote. The Union had its second-worst with 28.5%. This is only the second time that the winning party polled less than 30%; the first was in 2021.",
      "The far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, emerged as the strongest party across the country's formerly communist and less prosperous east. That cemented its primacy in a region that has long been its stronghold, and where it won its first state election last year.",
      "Other parties were stronger in only a few eastern constituencies outside Berlin. In western Germany, which accounts for most of the country's population, AfD trailed Merz's Union and sometimes other parties too but still polled strongly on its way to 20.8% of the nationwide vote, the highest postwar score for a far-right party.",
      "While AfD made the biggest gains, the Left Party made the most unexpected. The party appeared headed for electoral oblivion at the start of the campaign but pulled off a resounding comeback to take 8.8% of the vote.",
      "The Left Party appealed to young voters with very liberal positions on social and migration issues and a tax-the-rich policy, backed up by a savvy social media campaign.",
      "It benefited from polarization during the campaign after a motion that Merz put to parliament calling for many more migrants to be turned back at the border passed thanks to votes from AfD. Merz's conservatives have long refused to work with the Left Party, so there was no prospect of it putting him in the chancellery.",
      "Merz has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion. He wrote on social network X Monday that \u201cmore than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.\u201d He added that \"for a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "Germany became Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier after the United States under Scholz. Merz has at times criticized the outgoing government for doing too little, notably calling for Germany to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv. Scholz refused to do that.",
      "Merz, like Scholz, has been tightlipped so far on whether Germany might contribute to a possible peacekeeping force, suggesting that the discussion is premature.",
      "Scholz pulled off a narrow come-from-behind victory in 2021 after presenting himself as the safest pair of hands available.",
      "But his government's agenda was quickly upended by the Ukraine war and the ensuing energy and inflation crises. His coalition became notorious over time for infighting and poor communication. Scholz has suggested recently that he maybe should have ended it sooner than he did.",
      "Scholz sought another unlikely comeback. But too many voters, and even some in his own party, had cooled on the unpopular chancellor."

      "A report says a fleet of Chinese fishing vessels used North Korean crews in violation of U.N. bans and many were apparently subjected to abuses including being trapped at sea for years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A fleet of Chinese fishing vessels used North Korean crews between 2019 and 2024 in violation of U.N. bans, and many people were apparently subjected to abuses including being trapped at sea for years, a report said Monday.",
      "The Environmental Justice Foundation, a London-based group specializing in environmental and human rights issues, said it identified the presence of North Koreans on 12 Chinese tuna long-liners operating in the southwest Indian Ocean. The report was mostly based on interviews with 19 Indonesians and Filipinos who worked alongside them.",
      "\u201cThe testimony received from Indonesian and Filipino crew members suggests that concerted efforts were made to hide the presence of North Koreans on these vessels, and that those North Koreans on board were forced to work for as many as 10 years at sea \u2014 in some instances without ever stepping foot on land,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThis would constitute forced labor of a magnitude that surpasses much of that witnessed in a global fishing industry already replete with abuse,\u201d it added.",
      "The group said the North Koreans were passed from vessel to vessel to prevent them from returning to land. It cited unidentified Asian crew members as saying their North Korean shipmates were not allowed to use mobile phones or leave vessels during port visits.",
      "The group said it wasn\u2019t able to estimate the number of North Koreans aboard the Chinese vessels because of the transfers.",
      "The use of North Korean crew would be a breach of 2017 U.N. Security Council resolutions that required member states not to issue work permits to North Koreans and repatriate all remaining North Korean workers from their territories by the end of 2019.",
      "The sanctions were adopted after North Korea conducted nuclear and long-range missile tests in violation of earlier council resolutions.",
      "The report said the use of North Korean crew also appears to have bypassed legal frameworks in the U.S. and the European Union designed to prevent goods produced by North Koreans from entering their supply chains.",
      "Along with Russia, China is suspected of not fully enforcing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and has vetoed U.S.-led efforts to toughen U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its banned weapons tests.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry did not comment immediately.",
      "The EJF said it\u2019s the first time North Korean labor has been publicly documented on a distant-water fishing vessel.",
      "Before the 2019 U.N. deadline, tens of thousands of North Koreans were reported to be working abroad, mostly at factories and restaurants in China and logging camps and construction sites in Russia, to bring in much-needed foreign currency.",
      "North Korean workers abroad were in general under the constant surveillance of their country\u2019s security agents, toiled more than 12 hours a day and took home a fraction of their salaries, with the rest going to their government, according to defectors and experts.",
      "Despite the U.N. ban, South Korean officials and experts believe a large number of North Korean workers remain engaged in economic activities around the world and transmit money that is used in the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programs."

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel denied entry to European Parliament member Rima Hassan on Monday after accusing her of promoting boycotts of the country.",
      "Interior Minister Moshe Arbel said French politician Hassan has \u201cconsistently worked to promote boycotts against Israel in addition to numerous public statements both on social media and in media interviews.\u201d",
      "Hassan, 32, who was born in Aleppo, Syria, and is a member of The Left group in the European Parliament, traveled by air to Israel with four other lawmakers as part of an EU-Palestine delegation, according to her office, which said it was unaware of the decision to bar her entry to Israel. On arrival, she was denied entry into Israel and was forced to wait for a return flight to Europe.",
      "Israeli legislators passed a law this month that prohibits entry to the country to people who have denied Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack or expressed support for the international prosecution of Israeli soldiers.",
      "The law, which affects non-citizens and non-residents of Israel, builds on previous legislation that denied entry to anyone calling for a boycott of Israel. The law also bans the entry of Holocaust deniers.",
      "The original law was seen by opponents as an attempt by Israel to silence critics and it was used on multiple occasions to bar entry to activists who support the Palestinian-led boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, known as BDS.",
      "Supporters portray BDS as nonviolent activism based on a similar campaign against apartheid South Africa. Israel views the movement as an attack on its very legitimacy and accuses some of its organizers of antisemitism, allegations they deny.",
      "On Friday, Hassan and The Left group called for the immediate suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement \u2013 a pact that underpins their relations \u2013 given the International Court of Justice investigation into crimes committed against Palestinians in Gaza.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected Somali pirates have fled a Yemeni fishing boat they seized off the Horn of Africa and operated for five days, authorites said Monday.",
      "In a statement, a European naval force known as EUNAVFOR Atalanta said the pirates' initial Feb. 17 attack targeted a dhow, a traditional ship that plies the waters of the Mideast, off the town of Eyl in Somalia.",
      "The vessel, called the Saytuun-2, was under their control until Saturday, EUNAVFOR said. The pirates had ladders and weapons, suggesting they possibly sought to hijack other vessels while using the fishing boat as a so-called mothership.",
      "\u201cThe fishing vessel was vacated by the alleged pirates after they stole some of the crew\u2019s belongings,\u201d the naval force said. It added that the Saytuun-2's crew now were safe and free.",
      "The Feb. 17 attack came just days after another pirate attack on another Yemeni fishing boat which ultimately ended with the pirates fleeing and the mariners on board being recovered unhurt.",
      "Piracy off the Somali coast peaked in 2011 when 237 attacks were reported. Somali piracy in the region at the time cost the world\u2019s economy some $7 billion \u2014 with $160 million paid out in ransoms, according to the Oceans Beyond Piracy monitoring group.",
      "The threat was diminished by increased international naval patrols, a strengthening central government in Mogadishu, Somalia\u2019s capital, and other efforts.",
      "However, Somali pirate attacks have resumed at a greater pace over the last year, in part due to the insecurity caused by Yemen's Houthi rebels launching their attacks in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "In 2024, there were seven reported incidents off Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau."

      "The late leader of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group who was killed in an Israeli airstrike days after he took the post was laid to rest in his southern hometown",
      "BEIRUT -- The late leader of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group who was killed in an Israeli airstrike days after he took the post was laid to rest in his southern hometown Monday, a day after his cousin and predecessor was buried in Beirut.",
      "Hashem Safieddine, who was about 60, was killed in early October in a series of Israeli airstrikes in a southern suburb of Beirut at the height of the Israel-Hezbollah war. He was killed days after his cousin and predecessor Hassan Nasrallah was killed in Israeli airstrikes south of Beirut.",
      "Following Nasrallah\u2019s death on Sept. 27, Safieddine was secretly named Hezbollah\u2019s secretary-general but was killed just days later. The two men were buried at a secret location as they were both killed during the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war and their bodies exhumed for their funerals and reburial.",
      "Thousands of people marched behind Safieddine\u2019s coffin that was draped with Hezbollah\u2019s yellow flag in the southern village of Deir Qanoun An-Nahr while his black turban was placed on top.",
      "On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people attended the funeral of Nasrallah and Safieddine in Beirut in a show of strength by the Iran-backed group that suffered major losses during its war with Israel. Four Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude twice during the funeral in Beirut on Sunday, once when the coffins were brought into the stadium, where the funeral was held, and a second time when Hezbollah\u2019s current leader Naim Kassem was giving a speech.",
      "Nasrallah was buried in a Beirut suburb Sunday evening, while Safieddine\u2019s body was taken to his hometown in south Lebanon for Monday\u2019s funeral.",
      "Nasrallah and Safieddine were founding members of Hezbollah and enjoyed wide influence among Iran-backed Yemeni, Iraqi and Palestinian groups.",
      "A familiar face in Lebanon, Safieddine was a member of Hezbollah's decision-making Shura Council and its Jihad Council, which acts as its military command. He also headed its Executive Council, which runs schools and social programs.",
      "Safieddine was close to Iran. His son, Rida, is married to Zeinab Soleimani, the daughter of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2020.",
      "Safieddine\u2019s brother, Abdallah, is Hezbollah\u2019s point man in Tehran, a crucial role in the organization given that Iran is its main backer, providing it with weapons and money.",
      "During the Israel-Hezbollah war that broke out a day after the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel killed some of Hezbollah\u2019s top political and military chiefs. The war, that left more than 4,000 dead in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, ended on Nov. 27 when a U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect.",
      "Last week, Israel withdrew its troops from much of south Lebanon but kept five posts inside the country in what the Lebanese government considers a violation of the ceasefire. As part of the deal, Hezbollah should now have an armed presence along the border with Israel."

      "Friedrich Merz is on course to become post-World War II Germany\u2019s 10th chancellor, the culmination of a yearslong political career that was once sidelined by his party\u2019s iconic leader",
      "BERLIN -- Friedrich Merz, on course to become post-World War II Germany's 10th chancellor after the country's election, has vowed to prioritize European unity and the continent's security as it grapples with the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "Pulling a divided Europe together won't be easy when many leaders are too preoccupied by domestic issues to devote much energy to answers to the continent's most pressing problems. But expectations will be high for Merz to help fill a leadership vacuum and craft a united response to recent U.S. policy shifts that have strained the transatlantic alliance.",
      "\u201cAll the signals we are getting from the USA indicate that interest in Europe is clearly waning and that the willingness to get involved in Europe is decreasing,\" Merz told reporters at a press conference on Monday.",
      "\"Nevertheless, I hope that we can convince the Americans that it is in our mutual interest that we continue to have good trans-Atlantic relations.\u201d",
      "Merz's task will be complicated by the need to form a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He has repeatedly pledged not to work with the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party despite their second-place finish.",
      "The 69-year-old conservative leader heads the center-right Union bloc, which won Germany's national election with 28.5% of the votes.",
      "\u201cI am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us,\" he told supporters after his victory Sunday night. \u201cThe world out there isn\u2019t waiting for us, and it isn\u2019t waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations.\"",
      "The top job has been late in coming for Merz, a lawyer by profession, who saw his ascent derailed by former Chancellor Angela Merkel in the early 2000s and even turned his back on active politics for several years. Despite his political experience, he is heading to the chancellery without previously having served in government.",
      "Merkel has described Merz as a brilliant speaker and complimented his desire for leadership, though she acknowledged this was a problem in their relationship.",
      "\u201cWe are almost the same age ... We grew up completely differently, which was more of an opportunity than an obstacle,\" she wrote in her memoir \"Freedom.\"",
      "\"But there was one problem, right from the start: We both wanted to be the boss,\u201d she said.",
      "Merkel moved to consolidate her grip on Germany's center-right after the Union narrowly lost a national election in 2002. She pushed Merz aside as leader of its parliamentary group, taking the job herself in addition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union party she already held. She went on to lead Germany from 2005 to 2021.",
      "Merz turned his back on active politics for several years after leaving the parliament in 2009.",
      "He practiced law and headed the supervisory board of investment manager BlackRock\u2019s German branch. During that break, he often travelled for business to the United States and China, though he never lived outside Germany.",
      "\u201cFriedrich Merz is perhaps the most international chancellor Germany has had since the war \u2014 if he becomes chancellor,\u201d said Volker Resing, who wrote the recently published biography \u201cFriedrich Merz: His Path to Power.\u201d",
      "Merz \u201crelies on personal initiative, on the freedom of the individual, on creativity and motivation. And only secondarily on the state,\" Resing said.",
      "Merz launched his political comeback after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018 and announced that she wouldn't seek a fifth term of chancellor. However, he was narrowly defeated by centrist candidates more in Merkel's mold in party leadership votes in 2018 and early 2021.",
      "Merz persisted and was elected party leader in the third attempt, after the center-right's defeat by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany's 2021 election. Merz cemented his power by also becoming the leader of the Union's parliamentary group.",
      "According to Resing, Merz's \u201cway of doing politics\u201d is not to avoid confrontation at all costs. Instead, he maintains a perspective that \u201ca certain amount of provocation can set off a real debate and perhaps a real development in motion.\u201d",
      "During the election campaign, Merz has vowed to make Germany's ailing economy strong again and curb irregular migration.",
      "With President Donald Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Merz, who has long supported a strong transatlantic relationship, said after his victory that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the United States and Russia.",
      "\u201cI have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\u201d he told supporters. \"We are under such massive pressure ... my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\u201d",
      "Merz will be under pressure to help solve some of Europe\u2019s most urgent problems, according to Wolfgang Merkel, a political analyst from the WBZ Berlin Social Science Center, but \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t expect to hear one voice out of Brussels.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe interests are so different within the European Union, including the political majorities, that we shouldn\u2019t expect a resounding common EU policy,\u201d he said and added that it will likely \u201cbe the usual game of muddling through.\"",
      "Merz put toughening Germany's immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign after a migrant killed two people in a knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg last month.",
      "He brought a nonbinding motion before the parliament, calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. The motion was narrowly approved thanks to votes from the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party.",
      "That prompted his opponents to accuse Merz of breaking a taboo in allegedly working with the AfD, and a public rebuke from Merkel. Critics pointed to the episode as an illustration of what they say is Merz\u2019s tendency to impulsiveness.",
      "Since then, hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest against both Merz' motion and also the rise of the far right.",
      "Merz has insisted he did nothing wrong and never worked with AfD, and also repeatedly vowed to \u201cnever\u201d work with the party if he becomes chancellor.",
      "Merz represents his rural region in Germany\u2019s parliament \u2014 an area where people are \u201crather down-to-earth, perhaps a little reserved,\u201d Resing said. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped him: rural life.\u201d",
      "As a politician, Merz has always championed conservative values and stressed the importance of family.",
      "He met his wife Charlotte, who is now a judge, while he was studying law. The couple has three adult children.",
      "Merz joined the CDU in 1972 and was elected to the European Parliament in 1989. He first joined the German parliament in 1994.",
      "A pilot openly passionate about his hobby, Merz sometimes flies his own small plane from his home in the Sauerland region in western Germany to Berlin early on Monday mornings.",
      "He has stuck to flying, despite the long hours imposed by his job as opposition leader and occasional criticism that he is indulging in a rich man's hobby.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk to him about flying, his eyes light up,\u201d Resing said. \"He says that when you\u2019re above the clouds, that\u2019s freedom.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The first phase of the ceasefire that paused 15 months of brutal warfare between Israel and Hamas militants is set to end on Saturday",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire that paused 15 months of brutal warfare between Israel and Hamas militants is set to end on Saturday \u2014 and it's unclear what comes next.",
      "The two sides were supposed to start negotiating a second phase weeks ago in which Hamas would release all the remaining hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the war, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.",
      "But those negotiations have not begun \u2014 there have only been preparatory talks \u2014 and the first phase has been jolted by one dispute after another.",
      "Hamas has freed all 25 living hostages included in the first six-week phase ending on March 1 in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It has also released the bodies of four captives and is expected to turn over four more, though it's unclear if that will happen Thursday as planned.",
      "That leaves it with more than 60 captives, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Israel has meanwhile delayed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners who were supposed to be freed last weekend over the treatment of the captives, who were paraded before crowds.",
      "Israel is reportedly seeking an extension of the first phase to secure the freedom of more captives. But Hamas says it won't negotiate anything until the prisoners whose release was delayed are freed.",
      "Negotiations over Phase 2 will be even more contentious.",
      "The second phase was always going to be the most difficult because it would likely force Israel to choose between its two main war goals \u2014 the safe return of the hostages and the annihilation of their captors.",
      "Hamas, though weakened, remains in power with no internal challengers. In exchange for the remaining living hostages \u2014 its main bargaining chip \u2014 it is demanding a lasting ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. A third phase would see the exchange of remains and the start of Gaza's daunting reconstruction process, which is expected to take years and cost billions of dollars.",
      "Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, is returning to the region this week. In an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, he said he will aim for an extension of Phase 1 to buy time for negotiating the second phase.",
      "But Egypt, which has served as a key mediator, has refused to discuss an extension of Phase 1 until negotiations over Phase 2 begin, according to two Egyptian officials who were not authorized to brief reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "One official familiar with the negotiations said the mere launch of Phase 2 talks would keep the truce intact, according to the language of the deal. That would mean a continued halt in fighting and aid flowing into Gaza, though there would be no further hostage releases beyond what has already been negotiated, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss closed diplomatic contacts.",
      "Hamas has previously said it is open to a short extension to complete talks on Phase 2, but that was before Israel held up the release of the prisoners.",
      "One of the Egyptian officials said Egypt is also demanding Israel complete its withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor, on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, before moving on to the next phase. The agreement calls for that withdrawal to begin this weekend and be completed within eight days.",
      "Netanyahu has not publicly stated what he will do this weekend. He is under heavy pressure from hard-line coalition partners to resume the war against Hamas. But after images showed freed hostages returning home in poor condition, he also faces heavy public pressure to bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "Witkoff said Netanyahu is committed to bringing back all the hostages but has set a \u201cred line\u201d that Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah.",
      "Hamas has said it is willing to hand over control of Gaza to other Palestinians.",
      "But the militant group, which does not accept Israel's existence, would still be deeply entrenched in Gaza. And it says it won't lay down its arms unless Israel ends its occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war that Palestinians want for a future state.",
      "Hamas has also dismissed Israel's suggestion that its Gaza leadership go into exile.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire has yet to be completed and has only deepened the bitter mistrust on both sides.",
      "Israelis were shocked to see the captives \u2014 some of whom were emaciated \u2014 paraded before crowds upon their release, with some forced to smile, wave, deliver statements and, in one case, kiss a masked militant on the head. After returning to Israel, hostages said they were held under harsh conditions.",
      "Last Thursday, Hamas displayed coffins holding what it said were the remains of Shiri Bibas and her two small children, who it said were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel said a forensic investigation showed the two children were killed by their captors. The third body turned out to be someone else. Hamas then released another body that was confirmed to be the mother.",
      "On Saturday, Hamas filmed two hostages who were forced to watch the release of others, turning to a camera and begging to be released, in yet another public spectacle that infuriated Israel. That appears to have prompted Israel to postpone the release of the prisoners.",
      "Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire by killing dozens of people who the army said had approached its forces or entered unauthorized areas. It also accused Israel of dragging its feet on the entry of mobile homes and equipment for clearing rubble, which entered late last week, and of beating and abusing Palestinian prisoners prior to their release.",
      "Israel has also launched a major military operation in the occupied West Bank that has displaced some 40,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations. Israel says it is cracking down on militants who threaten its citizens, while Palestinians see it as trying to further cement its decades-long rule.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump took credit for the ceasefire, which Witkoff helped push across the finish line after a year of negotiations led by the Biden administration, Egypt and Qatar.",
      "But Trump has since sent mixed signals about the deal.",
      "Earlier this month, he set a firm deadline for Hamas to release all the hostages, warning \u201call hell is going to break out\u201d if it didn't. But he said it was ultimately up to Israel, and the deadline came and went.",
      "Trump sowed further confusion by proposing that Gaza's population of some 2 million Palestinians be relocated to other countries and for the U.S. to take over the territory and develop it. Netanyahu welcomed the idea, which was universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, including close U.S. allies. Human rights groups said it could violate international law.",
      "Trump stood by the plan in a Fox News interview over the weekend but said he's \u201cnot forcing it.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- Provisional results confirmed that mainstream conservatives led by Friedrich Merz won Germany\u2019s national election, while a far-right party surged to become the nation\u2019s second-largest.",
      "Merz, who\u2019s promising to unite Europe in the face of challenges from both Russia and the United States, is expected to become the country\u2019s next leader. He'll likely partner with the center left Social Democrats, who suffered a stinging defeat after their coalition collapsed. But the results were seen a rebuke for mainstream parties as the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany notched its best results ever.",
      "The campaign was dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe\u2019s biggest economy and pressure to curb migration, something that caused friction after Merz pushed hard in recent weeks for a tougher approach. It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe\u2019s alliance with the United States.",
      "The results released by the electoral authority showed Merz\u2019s Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.",
      "Merz said on election night that he hopes to form a government by Easter at the latest. He has ruled out a coalition with the far-right AfD, which is now the country\u2019s second-largest party.",
      "For the time being, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose Social Democratic party suffered a stinging defeat, will stay on as head of a caretaker government.",
      "Merz\u2019s conservatives won 208 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, while the AfD won 152. The three parties in the former governing coalition lost seats, with the SDP falling to 120 seats and the Greens to 85. The pro-business Free Democrats, which triggered early elections by pulling out of the coalition, failed to reach the 5% of the vote required to win seats.",
      "The Left party got 64 seats, while the left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance came in just under the 5% hurdle.",
      "The AfD was jubilant on Sunday night, with leaders vowing to become the country\u2019s main party in the next election as its appeal expands. The anti-immigrant, far-right party has established itself as a significant political force in the 12 years since it was founded, but it hasn\u2019t yet been part of any state or national government.",
      "That\u2019s the result of what is often called a \u201cfirewall\u201d against Alternative for Germany. Other parties say they won\u2019t work with the AfD, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected right-wing extremism, something that AfD objects to strongly. Its branches in three eastern states are designated \u201cproven right-wing extremist\u201d groups, which is particularly sensitive in view of Germany\u2019s Nazi past.",
      "The election took place seven months earlier than originally planned after Scholz\u2019s unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There was widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates.",
      "Merz said Sunday night that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the U.S. and Russia. Both U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Trump ally Elon Musk openly supported the AfD.",
      "\u201cI have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\u201d he told supporters. \u201cTake a look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "He added that \u201cthe interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. So we are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\u201d",
      "Germany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It has been Ukraine\u2019s second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S, and will be central to shaping the continent\u2019s response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration\u2019s confrontational foreign and trade policy.",

      "DAMASCUS -- A long-awaited national dialogue conference intended to help chart Syria\u2019s political future after the fall of former President Bashar Assad is set to begin Monday.",
      "The main session will be held on Tuesday, with participants holding workshops to discuss transitional justice, the structure of a new constitution, reforming and building institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society and the country\u2019s economy.",
      "The outcome of the national dialogue will be nonbinding recommendations to the country\u2019s new leaders.",
      "Plans for the conference \u2014 which had been promised by the country\u2019s new authorities in the immediate aftermath of Assad\u2019s fall in a lightning rebel offensive in December \u2014 had been in flux up until the last minute. The date of the conference was announced on Sunday, one day before it was to start.",
      "Two days before that announcement, Hassan al-Daghim, spokesperson for the committee organizing the national dialogue, had said the date of the conference had not been set and the timing was \u201cup for discussion by the citizens.\u201d He also said the number of participants had not been determined yet and might range from 400 to 1,000.",
      "It was not clear Monday what the final number would be or how the invited participants had been selected.",
      "The committee said Sunday that it had held more than 30 meetings across Syria\u2019s provinces in which some 4,000 people participated in the runup to the conference \u201cto ensure the representation of various components of Syrian society,\u201d state-run news agency SANA reported.",
      "It said participants had repeatedly called for a temporary constitutional declaration, an economic plan, the restructuring of government sectors, involving citizens in the management of institutions, and enhancing security and stability.",
      "After Assad was toppled, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its \u201csalvation government\u201d that had ruled in northwestern Syria.",
      "They said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria\u2019s interim president after a meeting of most of the country\u2019s former rebel factions. The groups agreed to dissolve the country\u2019s constitution, the former national army, security service and official political parties.",
      "The armed groups present at the meetings also agreed to dissolve themselves and for their members to be absorbed into the new national army and security forces. Notably absent was the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which holds sway in northeastern Syria and which has not been invited to participate in the national dialogue."

      "SALE, Morocco -- Moroccan authorities this month arrested a dozen people they said were planning attacks on behalf of the Islamic State in the Sahel, a region south of the Sahara Desert, officials said Monday.",
      "The discovery of the terrorist cell and what authorities called an \u201cimminent dangerous terrorist plot\u201d reflect the expanding ambitions of extremist groups in the region.",
      "Authorities did not provide details of the plot or motivations of those arrested, but released photographs and videos showing officers raiding terrorist cells throughout the country.",
      "The images showed weapons stockpiles found during police raids, Islamic State flags drawn on walls, and thousands of dollars of cash.",
      "\u201cMorocco remains a major target in the agenda of all terrorist organizations operating in the Sahel,\u201d Habboub Cherkaoui, the head of Morocco\u2019s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations, said at a news conference.",
      "Militant groups have been expanding their presence in the Sahel, capitalizing on instability in countries including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Since French troops began withdrawing almost two years ago, the Islamic State in the Sahel has launched deadly campaigns and taken control of lucrative transit routes.",
      "Groups like Islamic State in the Sahel have found support in impoverished communities that feel neglected by their governments. Their growth has destabilized and in several cases contributed to the overthrow of elected leaders. It has alarmed neighboring states \u2014 including in North Africa and coastal west Africa \u2014 and worried western powers concerned about militant groups using their regional bases to orchestrate violence elsewhere.",
      "Authorities said the Morocco-based cell called itself \"the Lions of the Caliphate in the Maghreb\u201d and took direction from Islamic State in the Sahel commanders. More than a year of tracking done by Morocco\u2019s General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance showed Islamic State in the Sahel commanders worked to recruit, arm and direct sympathizers to carry out attacks in Morocco.",
      "The weapons found include materials to make explosives including nail bombs, dynamite and gas cylinders as well as knives, rifles and hand guns whose serial numbers had been scratched off.",
      "Investigators said the 12 men arrested ranged from 18 to 40 years old and were apprehended in nine different cities, including Casablanca, Fez and Tangier. The majority were unmarried and had not finished high school. They have not yet been charged under Morocco's anti-terrorism laws.",
      "Based on materials gathered in raids last week, authorities were able to locate a cache of weapons in the desert near Morocco\u2019s border with Algeria, including firearms and ammunition wrapped in newspapers printed in Mali in late January.",
      "Authorities said the suspects arrested this month had maintained ties to Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, a militant leader born in the Morocco-controlled Western Sahara who was killed by French forces in 2021. In the years since, they took direction from the Libyan commander Abderrahmane Sahraoui, who oversees the group's operations outside the Sahel.",
      "Episodes of violence would be particularly damaging in Morocco, where the economy relies heavily on tourism. More than 17 million people visited the North African Kingdom last year and the tourism industry makes up more than 7% of its GDP.",
      "Morocco is the only in North Africa not to have experienced a major terrorist attack for more than a decade. But its security services regularly underscore that the threat remains and claim attacks are regularly foiled when terrorist cells are dismantled. They have in recent years dismantled 40 such cells, including one as recently as January.",
      "Cherkaoui said the operation revealed that Islamic State in the Sahel Sahel aimed to expand and establish operations in Morocco or recruit Moroccans to fight abroad, including most recently in Somalia. He said the groups \u201cdo not hide their desire to target Morocco through propaganda platforms\u201d and said Morocco\u2019s aggressive counterterrorism posture made it a target.",
      "Morocco has worked to present itself as a regional leader in combatting violent extremism, forging deeper ties with new governments throughout the Sahel, including Mali, with which signed a joint military cooperation agreement last month.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine on Monday marked the bleakest anniversary yet of its war against the Russia invasion, with the country's forces under severe pressure on the battlefield and the Trump administration apparently embracing the Kremlin in a reversal of U.S. policy.",
      "The three-year milestone drew more than a dozen Western leaders to Kyiv for commemorative events in a conspicuous show of support. They warned of the war\u2019s wider implications for global security and vowed to keep providing billions of dollars in support for Ukraine as uncertainty deepens over the U.S. commitment to help. Washington did not send any senior official to the occasion.",
      "The fourth year of fighting could be pivotal as Trump uses his return to office to press for a peace deal.",
      "World security is at stake in talks over how the war ends, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned.",
      "\u201cThe autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there\u2019s any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,\u201d she said.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau echoed that sentiment. Canadians, he said, \u201cbelieve deeply that it\u2019s not just about Ukraine. It\u2019s about the rules and the values and the principles of sovereignty, of independence, territorial integrity that protects every country in the world. All of us rely on those rules to be able to build peace and security.\"",
      "Some observers say Russian success in Ukraine could embolden China\u2019s ambitions. Just as Moscow claims that Ukraine is rightfully Russian territory, China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own. North Korea and Iran have also aided Russia's war effort.",
      "In a cascade of unwelcome developments for Kyiv, Trump has in recent days called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator, suggested Ukraine is to blame for the war and ended Putin\u2019s three-year diplomatic isolation by the United States. U.S. officials have also indicated to Ukraine that its hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably won\u2019t get back the land that Russia\u2019s army occupies, which amounts to nearly 20% of the country.",
      "Meanwhile, Putin\u2019s troops are making steady progress on the battlefield while Ukraine is grappling with shortages of troops and weapons.",
      "The guests in Kyiv and the leaders appearing by video had similar messages: Ukraine and its European partners must be consulted in any peace negotiations, Putin\u2019s ambitions must be thwarted, and Europe must take on more of the burden for its own defense.",
      "The shift in Washington's policy has set off alarm bells in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal. They are mulling how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The changes have also placed strain on transatlantic relations.",

The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list.",

      "Britain, too, imposed new sanctions, targeting 107 businesses and individuals in what it says is its biggest package targeting Russia\u2019s war machine since the early days of the conflict in 2022.",
      "The measures take aim at Russia\u2019s military supply chains, including companies in several countries \u2014 notably China \u2014 that Britain says are supplying machine tools, electronics and dual-use goods for Russia\u2019s military.",

      "\u201cRussia does not hold all the cards in this war,\" he said.",

      "It wasn\u2019t too long ago that many colleges weren\u2019t even selling alcoholic beverages at sporting events on campus",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Missy Vraney and Kristin Westphal didn't go to Marquette. Neither did any of their relatives. Yet their family tradition of attending Golden Eagles basketball games spans generations.",
      "\u201cWhenever our uncle couldn\u2019t go, our dad would take one of us and just kind of alternate,\u201d Vraney recalls.",
      "They\u2019re still supporting the school regularly \u2014 just in beer money rather than tuition fees. It happens every time they buy a Marquette Golden Ale before heading to the Fiserv Forum stands.",
      "This marks the first season since Marquette entered a partnership with Milwaukee-based Third Space Brewing to sell Marquette Golden Ale \u2014 the school\u2019s officially licensed and co-branded craft beer \u2014 at Golden Eagles sporting events as well as in Third Space outlets and area groceries. As part of the deal, 15% of the revenues go back to Marquette.",
      "\u201cPeople are extremely excited about it,\u201d said Andy Gehl, the co-founder and president of Third Space Brewing. \u201cPeople love drinking beer with their favorite school, their favorite sports team\u2019s logo on it. That\u2019s No. 1. Also, they want to support businesses that support their university, and vice versa.\u201d",
      "This has become the latest fund-raising trend for college athletics.",
      "Learfield, which manages sports sponsorships for over 160 universities and licensing agreements for nearly 800 colleges, says that 93 of its schools had licensing deals for alcoholic beverages for the first six months of the current fiscal year. That\u2019s a 57.6% rise from fiscal year 2023, when 59 schools had deals for their own signature alcoholic beverage.",
      "The number of Learfield schools with licensing deals specifically with craft beers has more than doubled in that time \u2013 from 16 in 2023 to 36 this year.",
      "Cory Moss, Learfield\u2019s president of brand management and marketing, acknowledges he would have been surprised by this kind of growth four or five years ago. Then he started noticing more interest from the schools themselves and from various local craft breweries wanting to establish partnerships.",
      "\u201cWhen schools got really behind it and the craft industry really started to take it seriously, that\u2019s when it really started to grow,\u201d Moss said. \u201cAnd that growth hasn\u2019t been surprising.\u201d",
      "It represents a major change in the college sports landscape, considering how many schools weren\u2019t even selling alcoholic beverages at their athletic events not so long ago. The Southeastern Conference didn\u2019t permit the sales of beer and wine at sporting events until 2019.",
      "That policy change spurred Tennessee and other SEC programs to start getting local breweries to launch signature beers that could be sold at their games as well as in stores or tap rooms off campus. Tennessee partnered with Knoxville-based Yee-Haw Brewing Company last summer to make Vol Lager the exclusive craft beer of the Tennessee Volunteers.",
      "\u201cI think for the distributors and even the companies to get a return on their investment in terms of the sponsorship, being able to sell it within the venues is a big deal because when our fans can see it \u2014 100,000 people walking into Neyland Stadium \u2014 they might grow fan affinity to buy it at the grocery store also,\u201d said Alicia Longworth, Tennessee\u2019s deputy athletics director/chief marketing officer. \u201cWith the timing, it was good for the business and it was good for us.\u201d",
      "Longworth said Tennessee sold 16 different types of beer throughout Neyland Stadium last fall and Vol Lager always ranked in the top four.",
      "Gehl said over 3,000 \u201ccase equivalents\u201d (including cases of the canned beer or the equivalent of a case in draft beer) of Third Space Brewing were sold in the first three months since its partnership with Marquette began. Third Space is now selling sweatshirts with both the Third Space and Marquette logos as well as glasses that resemble the Marquette Golden Ale can.",
      "Other schools have enjoyed similar success with their signature beers. Learfield said college-licensed alcoholic beverages had $7.5 million in total sales during the 2024 fiscal year.",
      "Some universities with signature beers have proceeds go directly to the schools. Others have it go through collectives. For instance, Cincy Reigns \u2014 a collective benefiting Cincinnati athletics, established a partnership with Cincinnati brewery Rhinegeist to sell Cincy Light at Bearcats games and around the area.",
      "\u201cSome of the early feedback I received was there were bars and restaurants that said fans were showing up in gear just to drink Cincy Light at the bar,\u201d said Brian Fox, who chairs the Cincy Reigns board of directors. \u201cI think there was a TGI Friday's in one of the suburban areas, that said people were showing up \u2014 they weren\u2019t getting a table for dinner, they just knew they had Cincy Light on tap, so they showed up in fan gear, University of Cincinnati athletics gear just to try Cincy Light.\u201d",
      "Moss noted that these type of partnerships require plenty of input from both the school and the brewery, noting that you can\u2019t make a successful product just by slapping a school logo on a beer can.",
      "These schools generally try to find breweries with local ties. Yee-Haw, the company that partnered with Tennessee, was founded by Tennessee law school graduate Joe Baker. Third Space, which makes Marquette Golden Ale, has its brewery less than 1 \u00bd miles from Marquette\u2019s campus.",
      "But the most important factor in the success of these beers is obvious.",
      "Joe Dobrogowski of Germantown, Wisconsin, made that point clear as he enjoyed a Marquette Golden Ale before a recent game.",
      "\u201cIf it didn\u2019t taste good, I wouldn\u2019t force myself to drink,\u201d the Marquette season-ticket holder said. \u201cThat\u2019s first and foremost. I think it\u2019s just a bonus that some of it goes back to the school.\u201d",

      "Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, carried a pistol and zip ties into the intensive care unit at UPMC Memorial Hospital in southern Pennsylvania's York County and took staff members hostage Saturday before he was killed in a shootout with police, officials said. The attack also left a doctor, nurse, custodian and two other officers wounded.",

      "\u201cIt tends to be someone who\u2019s mad at somebody,\u201d Sem said. \u201cIt might be a domestic violence situation or employees, ex-employees. There\u2019s all kinds of variables.\u201d",

      "MANDAN, N.D. -- A Texas pipeline company's lawsuit accusing Greenpeace of defamation, disruptions and attacks during protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline goes to trial in North Dakota on Monday, in a case the environmental advocacy organization says threatens free speech rights and its very future.",
      "The lawsuit stems from the protests in 2016 and 2017 over the oil pipeline's planned Missouri River crossing, upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe has long argued that the pipeline threatens its water supply. Of the thousands of people who protested the project, hundreds were arrested.",
      "Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access allege trespass, nuisance, defamation and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International and its American branch, Greenpeace USA. The lawsuit also names the group's funding arm, Greenpeace Fund Inc.",

      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer alleges Greenpeace tried to delay construction of the pipeline, defamed the companies behind it, and coordinated trespassing, vandalism and violence by pipeline protesters. The lawsuit seeks millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The Dakota Access Pipeline was completed and has been transporting oil since June 2017.",
      "Greenpeace International said it shouldn't be named in the lawsuit because it is distinct from the two U.S.-based Greenpeace entities, operates outside the U.S., and its employees were never in North Dakota or involved with the protests.",
      "Greenpeace USA said the plaintiffs have failed to back up their claims in the years since the protests.",
      "Earlier in February, a judge denied motions by Greenpeace to throw out or limit parts of the case.",
      "Representatives of the environmental organization founded over 50 years ago said the company just wants to silence oil industry critics.",
      "\u201cThis trial is a critical test of the future of the First Amendment, both freedom of speech and peaceful protest, under the Trump administration and beyond,\u201d Greenpeace USA Interim Executive Director Sushma Raman told reporters. \u201cA bad ruling in this case could put our rights and freedoms in jeopardy for all of us, whether we are journalists, protesters or anyone who wants to engage in public debate.\u201d",
      "Greenpeace USA helped support \u201cnonviolent, direct-action training\u201d on safety and de-escalation at the protests, Senior Legal Adviser Deepa Padmanabha said.",

      "Earlier in February, Greenpeace International filed an anti-intimidation suit in the District Court of Amsterdam against Energy Transfer, saying the company acted wrongfully and should pay costs and damages resulting from its \u201cmeritless\" litigation.",
      "An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the lawsuit is about Greenpeace not following the law.",
      "\u201cIt is not about free speech as they are trying to claim. We support the rights of all Americans to express their opinions and lawfully protest. However, when it is not done in accordance with our laws, we have a legal system to deal with that,\u201d Energy Transfer spokeswoman Vicki Granado said in a statement.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The IRS will lay off roughly 7,000 workers in Washington and around the country beginning Thursday, a person familiar with the plans told The Associated Press.",
      "The layoffs affect probationary employees with roughly one year or less of service at the agency and largely include workers in compliance departments, according to the person, who was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday. Compliance work includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code, filing their returns and paying their taxes, among other duties.",
      "The layoffs are part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. They come despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer filing deadline.",
      "It's unclear how the layoffs may affect tax collection services this year. As the nation's revenue collector, the IRS was tasked during the Biden administration with targeting high-wealth tax evaders for an additional stream of income to the U.S., which is $36 trillion in debt. By the end of 2024, the IRS collected over $1.3 billion in back taxes from rich tax dodgers.",
      "The IRS has roughly 90,000 employees total across the United States, according to the latest IRS data. Racial minorities make up 56% of the IRS workforce, and women represent 65%.",
      "In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. In a letter sent earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts.",

      "The La Guajira region in northern Colombia, home to the Indigenous Wayuu community, holds vast potential for renewable energy, especially wind power, but projects have faced resistance",
      "CABO DE LA VELA, Colombia -- Giant wind turbines tower over a cemetery sacred to Zoyla Velasquez and her Indigenous Wayuu community, native to the La Guajira region in northern Colombia.",
      "This arid, wind-swept region, dotted with cacti and roaming herds of goats, holds immense potential to position Colombia as a wind and solar energy leader. However, resistance from the Wayuu community has stalled many proposed projects by multinational companies and the government. The Wayuu have concerns about the environmental and cultural impacts and the lack of prior consultation in what's one of the nation\u2019s poorest regions. Now, these companies are also eyeing the region\u2019s offshore wind farm prospects.",
      "\u201cThis cemetery is sacred to us, the Wayuu,\u201d 64-year-old Velasquez said in Spanish, though she is more comfortable speaking in her native Wayuunaiki. Wayuu leaders say what is threatened isn\u2019t the cemetery itself but the spirituality of the territory. \u201cIt is here that the bones of our ancestors rest. That's what matters most to us.\u201d",
      "The region could generate approximately 15 gigawatts of wind energy, according to Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which could power up to an estimated 37.5 million homes annually. It's part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The Wayuu say this isn\u2019t happening.",
      "Construction started on the La Guajira 1 wind farm \u2014 which looms over the cemetery near Cabo de la Vela \u2014 in 2020 after a mix of legal processes, government backing, and controversial negotiations and unsatisfactory prior consultation. It faced significant opposition from the Wayuu and has been producing electricity since 2022, but is not yet hooked up to the interconnected system.",
      "\u201cWayuu spirituality is the fundamental base of our life and existence,\u201d said An\u00edbal Mercado, a \u201cPalabrero,\u201d head of the regional Wayuu council. He wasn't part of the consultations due to his staunch opposition. \u201cIf something disturbs the peacefulness of our dead, they\u2019re affecting spiritual peace and tranquility. And as long as (the turbines) are there, there is going to be direct violation, anxiety and impact.\u201d",

They also have a traditional governance system and laws based on their cultural and spiritual practices.",
      "Critics warn that the government\u2019s push to expedite approvals for other developments could escalate tensions.",
      "\u201cLa Guajira has been very sought after by these companies,\u201d Samuel Lanao, head of Corpoguajira, La Guajira\u2019s environment authority told The Associated Press in Riohacha, the region's capital. \u201cWhen a foreign company enters these territories with the intention of exploiting renewable energies, there is always going to be a clash.\"",
      "Colombia's government has committed to respecting Indigenous rights through legal frameworks like the 1991 Constitution, which recognizes Indigenous autonomy, and international agreements that ensure their right to prior consultation and participation in decisions that affect them. The 2016 Peace Agreement also touched on Indigenous communities\u2019 rights, land restitution, and participation in political processes.",
      "Social issues have begun to spook companies, with 57 planned projects stalled, according to Indepaz, a Bogot\u00e1-based development organization with extensive research on the matter. While some projects are Colombian, the majority involve international companies from Brazil, Europe, U.S. and Canada.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear they\u2019re worried. There\u2019s been a slowdown in the progress of these energy transition projects precisely because of that conflict,\u201d Lanao said. \u201cI believe that the national government plays an important role in achieving a community-company agreement.\u201d",
      "Colombia\u2019s environment ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its lifespan, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine what this energy transition means to us,\u201d Lanao said. \u201cThis renewable energy sector comes to supply the income that the coal exploitation gives us today in La Guajira.\u201d",
      "Developing wind projects in Guajira is key to guaranteeing a reliable supply of electricity in Colombia, says Margarita Nieves, founder of Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network and La Guajira native.",
      "Nieves added for La Guajira, it represents an opportunity to have a new industry that will generate employment, position it as a center for the production of goods and services for the wind energy sector, and contribute to meeting the electricity demand of its inhabitants.",
      "But the issue is also causing internal friction within the Wayuu community which stems from differing views on economic benefits, with some supporting development for financial gain.",
      "The AP spoke to several Wayuu families living near wind turbines who do not oppose the companies operating there, as they have received financial assistance and housing.",
      "Others are not convinced.",
      "\u201cAn old saying goes that if you\u2019ve never owned a chicken, manure looks like an egg to you,\u201d Mercado, the Palabrero, said when asked about those in the community who accept help from the companies, which is much less than what he'd consider fair compensation.",
      "\u201cThere are many communities that have never had anything. In the midst of so much need, so much crisis, so much hunger, any little penny that they are being offered now seems like a miracle cure and the greatest wealth in the world to them,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies are now carrying out studies for offshore wind farms, which is also enraging the Wayuu, especially traditional fishers, known as Apalanchii.",
      "Lanao, of the environmental authority, says just because the project is in the sea, it does not mean the communities do not have influence.",
      "The Apalanchii use traditional fishing techniques, with nets, hooks and sometimes spearfishing. It is not only a means of sustenance but also a culturally important activity which they say ties them to their ancestors and the land.",
      "\u201cWe are really worried about the offshore wind farms,\u201d said fisherman Aaron Laguna Ipuana, 57, during an early morning fishing trip in Cabo de la Vela with his crew. \u201cThey're going to displace us and the sea is everything to us. It sustains us.\"",
      "Mercado says the government needs to do more to ensure Wayuu people are involved.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that these projects continue and that the government is letting them go ahead, without even coming to say what is going to happen and what is in the interest of the Wayuu people,\" said Mercado.",
      "\u201cThe Wayuu defend their territory with blood and death, if necessary,\u201d he said.",
      "At the cemetery, Velasquez, dressed in a traditional Wayuu robe and headscarf, gently strokes and observes the graves alongside her sister and young niece. In the background, the turbine blades continue to turn.",
      "\u201cThe nobility of a Wayuu is used by companies,\u201d Velazquez says. \u201cMay they do something good for us ... the way we want it.\u201d",

      "Their mission was to advance AI for humanity's benefit.",
      "More than a decade later, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or Ai2, isn't nearly as well-known as the ChatGPT maker but is still pursuing the \u201chigh-impact\u201d AI sought by Allen, who died in 2018. One of its latest AI models, Tulu 3 405B, rivals OpenAI and China's DeepSeek on several benchmarks. But unlike OpenAI, it says it's developing AI systems that are \u201ctruly open\u201d for others to build upon.",
      "The institute's CEO Ali Farhadi has been running Ai2 since 2023 after a stint at Apple. He spoke with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Our mission is to do AI innovation and AI breakthroughs to solve some of the biggest working problems facing humanity today. The biggest threat to AI innovation is the closed nature of the practice. We have been pushing very, very strongly towards openness. If you think about open-source software, the core essence was, \u2018I should be able to understand what you did. I should be able to change it. I should be able to fork from it. I should be able to use part of it, half of it, all of it. And once I build my thing, I put it out there and you should be able to do the same.\u2019",
      "It is a really heated topic at the moment. To us, open-source means that you understand what you did. Open weights models (such as Meta's) are great because people could just grab those weights and follow the rest, but they aren't open source. Open source is when you actually have access to every part of the puzzle.",
      "If I want to postulate, some of these training data have a little bit of questionable material in them. But also the training data for these models are the actual IP. The data is probably the most sacred part. Many think there\u2019s a lot of value in it. In my opinion, rightfully so. Data plays a significant role in improving your model, changing the behavior of your model. It\u2019s tedious, it\u2019s challenging. Many companies spend a lot of dollars, a lot of investments, in that domain and they don\u2019t like to share it.",
      "As it matures, I think AI is getting ready to be taken seriously for crucial problem domains such as science discovery. A good part of some disciplines involves a complicated search for a solution -- for a gene structure, a cell structure or specific configurations of elements. Many of those problems can be formulated computationally. There's only so much you can do by just downloading a model from the web that was trained on text data and fine tuning it. Our hope is to empower scientists to be able to actually train their own model."

      "WASHINGTON -- The heads of four major labor unions on Wednesday called on President Donald Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other \u201cstrong penalties\u201d against China for its increasing dominance in that sphere.",
      "The presidents of the United Steelworkers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers argue that China's efforts have hurt American workers and national security.",
      "In the letter obtained by The Associated Press, they urged Trump to \u201cimpose tough penalties against vessels built according to the plans, policies, and actions of the Chinese Communist Party and to adopt complementary policies that rebuild America's shipbuilding capacity and workforce.\u201d",
      "Last year under President Joe Biden, the unions filed a petition seeking to address China\u2019s shipbuilding under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, hoping to start a process by which tariffs and other measures could be enacted.",
      "The letter notes China manufactured more than 1,000 ocean-going vessels in 2023, while the United States made fewer than 10 ships. It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",

      "Car companies are always introducing compelling new models, making it harder to decide if you should get a new car, truck or SUV now or wait to see what else might be available within the year",
      "Ready to buy a new car? Well, you might want to wait because there are some cool and compelling models coming soon to a showroom near you. They range from a retro-themed performance sedan with a traditional gasoline engine to a rugged off-road SUV powered by electricity. There\u2019s even a pickup truck that offers a gas engine and electric propulsion simultaneously, which could be a game changer. Edmunds\u2019 editors highlight what they think will be the most interesting vehicles for car shoppers coming out later this year.",
      "Maybe you\u2019ve seen the Charger Daytona R/T, Dodge\u2019s new electric performance coupe that draws design inspiration from the classic 1969 Charger. But what if you don\u2019t want an EV? And what if you need four doors? Good news is on the horizon, and it takes the form of the 2026 Charger Sixpack four-door sedan equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder gas engine.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cHurricane,\u201d the engine makes 420 horsepower in standard-output specification, more than the 5.7-liter V8 available in the old Charger. We also expect Dodge will follow it up later with a high-output engine making 550 horsepower.",
      "The Honda Prelude was a showcase of Honda design and engineering in the 1980s and 1990s. But after the 2001 model year, it disappeared from the automaker\u2019s lineup. A quarter of a century later, it\u2019s finally coming back.",
      "The all-new 2026 Honda Prelude will be a hybrid. We expect Honda will use the hybrid powertrain that it uses in the hybrid versions of the CR-V and Civic. Honda hasn\u2019t said how much power it will make or what kind of fuel economy you can expect. However, the Prelude will come with a Honda S+ Shift feature that the company says will make the it more fun to drive than your typical hybrid.",
      "With few exceptions, most electric SUVs are best driven on the pavement instead of off-road. Jeep plans to change that with the upcoming 2026 Recon, a bold and boxy EV with promising trail-rated off-roading capability and a similar open-air driving experience to a Wrangler.",
      "Jeep recently featured the Recon in a commercial starring Harrison Ford. Beyond that, however, the company has provided few details. We don\u2019t know how much range the Recon will have or how much it will cost. But we do know it will come with all-terrain tires, skid plates, a power-opening top, and removable windows and doors. And with trail guide maps embedded into the infotainment system and electronic locking axles, the Jeep Recon should be ready to rock on the path less traveled.",
      "Boasting one of the most appropriate vehicle names in history, the Ram Ramcharger is a full-size pickup truck equipped with electric motors and a battery pack. So far, that\u2019s just like a Ford F-150 Lightning. The trick is that it also has a gasoline-fueled V6 engine to eliminate the problem of range anxiety.",
      "Ram\u2019s range-extending powertrain solution sounds complex, but there is a simple explanation of how it works. When the battery is out of charge, the gas engine serves as a backup generator, allowing the Ramcharger to travel an estimated 690 miles before requiring electricity or gasoline to continue the journey. In theory, you can drive the Ramcharger without ever visiting an EV charging station, or you can skip traditional gas stations altogether.",
      "Better yet, there aren\u2019t any downsides when it comes to capability. Ram says the Ramcharger can tow up to 14,000 pounds and zoom to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds.",
      "Current Rivian trucks and SUVs are expensive, but the upcoming R2 SUV addresses that with a target price of $45,000. Smaller than the existing R1S but equipped with the same rugged, high-tech good looks, the Rivian R2 holds five people and travels more than 300 miles on a full battery. It comes with all-wheel drive and a healthy 9.8 inches of maximum ground clearance to help you out when going off-road.",
      "With rear vent windows and back glass that powers down into the tailgate, the Rivian R2 will give the Jeep Recon some competition. Just remember the R2\u2019s doors don\u2019t come off like the Recon\u2019s. As for timing, it should be available in the first half of 2026.",
      "We like these five upcoming models for their nostalgic appeal, technological innovation, or promise of fun no matter where you\u2019re going or what you\u2019re doing. At least one of them, the Jeep Recon, delivers all three of those traits.",

      "Lau relies on water and electricity to operate his thriving export business in Malaysia\u2019s Johor province, where he raises a kaleidoscope of tropical fish in rows of aquariums, including albino fish with red spots that can fetch up to $10,000 from collectors. His contingency plans in the event of an outage involve an intricate system of purifying wastewater through friendly bacteria and an alarm system to quickly switch to backup power.",
      "But these measures can\u2019t compete with the gigantic, power-guzzling and thirsty data centers being built in Johor. The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, according to a report published in April.",
      "Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, according to researchers at Malaysia\u2019s Kenanga Investment Bank. This is more than half of Malaysia\u2019s entire renewable capacity in 2023.",
      "Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in September that the country was \u201cconfident of a surplus of energy\u201d to fuel large projects and keep exporting.",
      "But Lau doesn't fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. Even without data centers, Malaysia is susceptible to power interruptions because of storms, including one that lasted 30 minutes last year and killed 300,000 fish, costing Lau over $1 million. He worries that data centers would result in longer outages.",
      "To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm.",
      "\u201cBig data center is coming and there is shortage of power,\" he said. \"It\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.",
      "But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers' transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the American nonprofit Good Jobs First.",
      "Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to \u201cdigital colonialism.\u201d She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.",
      "\u201cThey are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn\u2019t even leave (behind) taxes,\u201d she said.",
      "Indeed, only a small portion of Malaysia's data center capacity is actually for Malaysian users. Through a network of submarine cables that fans out into the world, they service East Asia, China and Europe. And the data centers themselves are run by foreign companies like America\u2019s Equinix and Microsoft as well as Chinese competitor GDS Holdings that works with tech giants like Alibaba.",
      "These data centers are also on the front lines of AI competition between the U.S. and China. Shortly before he left office, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed new rules that would limit exports of advanced AI chips made by U.S. companies like Nvidia, part of a strategy to deprive China and other U.S. adversaries from gaining access to AI technology through data centers in places likes Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Although it\u2019s unclear if the Trump administration will retain the policy, which hasn\u2019t yet taken effect, GDS Holdings saw its stock drop more than 18% on the day of the announcement.",
      "For now, artificial intelligence is driving the hunger for even more data centers, with tech companies seeking out bigger \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 sites worldwide as a part of a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d said Rangu Salgame, chairman and CEO of Singapore\u2019s Princeton Digital Group, which is building a 170-megawatt site in Johor. Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields \u2014 about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider Stream Data Centers.",
      "That\u2019s costly to build in rich nations like the U.S., which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield. This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline.",
      "Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity \u2014 still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin \u2014 but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,\u201d Salgame said.",
      "Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country\u2019s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended.",
      "In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion \u2014 three times the investments for 2023 \u2014 in the first 10 months of 2024, according to research by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm Baxtel. That's the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational.",
      "The data centers that are running look anonymous from the outside. But they can be identified by the tell-tale signs of barbed wire fences, CCTV cameras and patrolling security guards. Elsewhere, a thicket of cranes and workers operating construction machinery is transforming the landscape in the sleepy province.",
      "Salgame said that he hoped data centers could accelerate clean energy growth and experts like Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute agreed that this could happen, but warned that the sheer volume of unforeseen, future demand complicates the transition.",
      "\u201cAdd data centers on top of that, it just becomes much more challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Tropical Malaysia is warmer than the countries that were initially preferred by data centers, including Ireland, and would require more water and power for cooling, said Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company studying the unintended consequences of digital trends. He said that these companies are moving to new countries after their promises of economic growth were found to be \u201cempty.\" And while new solar or wind farms can be built faster than other forms of energy, data centers need a lot of electricity from the get-go.",
      "\u201cThese big tech companies are trying to distract you from the really simple math,\u201d he said.",
      "Malaysia acknowledges that the energy demand from data centers is \u201csubstantial\u201d but believes that Johor\u2019s rise as a \u201cdata center powerhouse\u201d will make it a \u201ckey player in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital ecosystem,\u201d said Malaysian Investment, Trade and Industry minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz in an email. He added that Malaysia was writing efficiency guidelines for data centers and has a policy to let them buy clean energy directly from producers.",
      "But concerns are rising among residents about potential water shortages in the future \u2014 echoing the concerns of other developing countries like Chile. Malaysia, like much of Southeast Asia, is at risk of extreme weather including drought, according to a 2022 U.N. climate change report. Francis Hutchinson, an analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said that Johor has faced recent disruptions and new stressors, like a growing population and water parks to boost tourism, could exacerbate the crisis.",
      "\u201cWater, more than power, is a potential issue,\u201d he said.",

      "South Africa\u2019s budget announcement by the finance minister has been abruptly canceled and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The South African government's annual presentation of its budget was abruptly canceled Wednesday and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition.",
      "The finance minister's budget speech normally takes place in February. Parliament Speaker Thoko Didiza said it was the first time that the presentation had been canceled over such a disagreement in the 31 years of South Africa\u2019s democracy after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.",
      "South Africa has a 10-party coalition in government after the long-ruling African National Congress, or ANC, lost its majority in an election last year for the first time since apartheid ended. That means it cannot pass the budget without support from other parties in Parliament.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the country\u2019s second biggest party, said the budget postponement was over a 2% increase in value-added tax proposed by the ANC. The DA said in a statement that the tax increase \u201cwould have broken the back of our economy.\u201d",
      "The budget delay came just over a week after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa to be cut over a contentious land law. The move by Trump was expected to put pressure on South Africa\u2019s government to find funds to plug gaps, especially in the public health service. South Africa was already impacted by Trump\u2019s 90-day global freeze on U.S. aid.",
      "Africa\u2019s most advanced economy has barely grown in recent years. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana told reporters that the government was facing fiscal challenges.",
      "\u201cDo we borrow more, and what are the implications of that?\u201d Godongwana said. \u201cDo we continue cutting expenditure? What are the implications of that? Do we raise tax and what are the implications of that?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is general agreement that in the current environment, we need to find ways of funding our priorities.\u201d",
      "The opposition Umkhonto we Sizwe Party said the government\u2019s failure to propose a budget was proof that \u201cthis country has no leadership.\"",
      "Most recently the ANC and the DA disagreed over the passing of the Land Expropriation Act, which empowers the government to seize private land for public benefit.",
      "The parties have also fallen out over an education bill, which would give the government more control over white minority language schools.",
      "The Black Business Council, which advocates for Black-owned businesses' inclusion in the country's economy, has cautioned that the budget postponement might cause uncertainty among investors.",
      "\u201cWe are busy dealing with the Trump issue, and we are working on sending envoys to the world to say (South Africa) is intact, but when you have something like this that you can control, and you just basically throw your arms in the air, it doesn\u2019t bode very well for South Africa and for the government,\" said the council's CEO Kganki Matabane.",

      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, also eased this week. The average rate fell to 6.04% from 6.09% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.29%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Rising home prices and elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase.",

      "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but this year appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but 2025 appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Still, shares tumbled nearly 9% before the opening bell Thursday and it pulled other big retailers down with it. The retail sector is the biggest decliner in premarket trading and Target slid 2%.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation. Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart\u2019s online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\u201cWe have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\u201d said CEO Doug McMillon. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we\u2019re in great shape with inventory.\u201d",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart\u2019s sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",
      "Analysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.",
      "For Walmart\u2019s U.S. division, comparable store sales \u2014 which include online and stores open for the past 12 months \u2014 rose 4.6% in the U.S., a bit lower than the 5.3% in the previous quarter. The retailer had a 4.2% jump in the U.S. in the second quarter and 3.8% in the first quarter.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 16% in the latest quarter, notably slower than the 27% increase in the third quarter.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That\u2019s also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",

      "\u201cFeels nice to qualify,\u201d New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner said.",
      "\u201cThe way we pulled things back with the ball was amazing. (It\u2019s) hard to take middle-overs wickets in ODIs and Bracewell was amazing. He\u2019s a quality bowler now, (and) the way he can change his pace on these wickets is outstanding.\u201d",
      "Fast bowlers Taskin Ahmed and Nahid Rana jolted New Zealand to 15-2 when Will Young, who made a century against Pakistan, went for a duck and Kane Williamson fell for rare consecutive single-digit scores in ODIs, 5 after 1.",
      "Taskin clean-bowled Young with a nip-backer into the right-hander and Williamson edged the tall Rana, whom New Zealand batters were facing for the first time in an international.",
      "But Ravindra combined with Devon Conway to revive the chase. They shared 57 in 12 overs before Pakistan's third pace bowler, Mustafizur Rahman, got Conway to chop on on 30.",
      "Tom Latham (55) then joined Ravindra and they shared a match-winning 129-run stand.",
      "The left-handers thwarted the pace of Nahid and were equally good against the spin of Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Rishad Hossain.",
      "Ravindra, who batted at No. 4 in place of Daryl Mitchell, got a lucky escape on 93 when Miraz couldn\u2019t hold onto a sharp low catch at point. He completed his fourth ODI century off 95 balls with 11 fours and a six.",
      "Ravindra was dropped again after his century by Mahmudullah at mid-on, and the batter finally holed out in the deep to give Rishad his only wicket.",
      "Latham was run out for 55, his third consecutive half-century, when New Zealand was just 23 runs shy of the target.",
      "Bracewell finished off the game with a cover-driven boundary off Rishad, with Glenn Phillips unbeaten on 21.",
      "\u201cI was hoping not to get the pad on to bat,\" Bracewell said, \"but it\u2019s always nice to go out there and finish the game.\"",
      "Bracewell squeezed Bangladesh after its promising start in his unchanged 10-over spell. The off-spinner bowled 43 dot balls and conceded just one six and a boundary.",
      "Shanto struggled to up the ante in his 110-ball knock, especially against Bracewell.",
      "When Santner introduced him inside the powerplay, Bracewell struck off his second ball. Tanzid Hasan tried to play across the line on 24 in a 45-run opening stand with Shanto, and Williamson made a diving catch.",
      "Bracewell dried up the runs and strangled the middle order with his deceptive pace, dismissing Towhid Hridoy (7), Mushfiqur Rahim (2) and Mahmudullah (4). Hridoy, who scored a century against India in the first match, was brilliantly snapped up by Williamson over his shoulder when he ran backwards from cover.",
      "\u201cAwesome to contribute to a win,\" Bracewell said. \u201cThe breeze across was like the conditions at home. \u2026 I\u2019m geared up to bowl 10 overs in every game, even at Eden Park, but sometimes you don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Shanto was caught by Bracewell after he top-edged O\u2019Rourke.",
      "Jaker Ali (45) and Rishad Hossain (26) counterattacked against the pace, but New Zealand allowed them only 64 runs in the last 10 overs.",
      "\u201cI thought we started well with the bat,\u201d Shanto said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good wicket, we just needed two big partnerships, but it was a disappointing (total) after 10 overs.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, South Africa and Australia, which won their opening Group B games, face each other at the same venue.",

      "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- New York Mets starter Sean Manaea is expected to begin the season on the injured list because of a right oblique strain.",
      "Manaea said Monday that had been dealing with the issue since getting to spring training.",
      "\u201cDidn't really get worse, it just kind of plateaued,\u201d Manaea said. \u201cThe worst part is it just never got any better over the last couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "The left-hander, the Mets' top starter last season who then got a $75 million, three-year contract, said he had been throwing and pitching but that \u201crecovery hasn't really been the greatest in between.\u201d He had an MRI over the weekend.",
      "Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said Manaea wouldn't throw again until he was free of symptoms, and he indicated that could take two to three weeks.",
      "\u201cThe good news is ... the tendon is not involved, the rib cage is not involved. So it\u2019s just straight muscle,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cHe's going to be shut down for a couple of weeks. So, and then we reassess after that, and we\u2019ve got to build him back up again. So, safe to say that he\u2019s probably going to start the season on the IL.\u201d",
      "Mendoza also told reporters at camp on Monday that infielder Nick Madrigal fractured his left (non-throwing) shoulder when he got hurt in a spring training game the previous day.",
      "The 27-year-old Madrigal, who is fighting for a roster spot, was playing shortstop Sunday when he charged a grounder up the middle and fired to first base before falling to the grass. An MRI revealed the extent of the injury, and he having more testing done Monday.",
      "With Manaea now sidelined, the Mets are without two of their expected starters. Frankie Montas is out because of a strained back.",
      "Montas, who signed a two-year, $34 million free-agent contract in December, was shut down last week for what the Mets said would be six to eight weeks. He is not expected back before May.",
      "If all goes well for Manaea, he could be return in April.",
      "That leaves the Mets with a projected rotation of Kodai Senga, David Peterson, former All-Star closer Clay Holmes, Paul Blackburn and Griffin Canning.",
      "Manaea went 12-6 with a 3.47 ERA in 32 starts during his Mets debut last season.",
      "His new, three-year contract came after he declined his player option for 2025, passing up the final $13.5 million of a $28 million, two-year deal he initially signed with the Mets. The 33-year-old was a free agent for the third consecutive offseason and had turned down a $21.05 million qualifying offer from the team.",
      "Manaea struck out 184 batters and walked 63 in a career-high 181 2/3 innings last year. He lowered his arm slot in midseason to emulate another nasty left-hander, NL Cy Young Award winner Chris Sale of the Atlanta Braves, and became New York\u2019s most effective starter down the stretch, with a 6-2 record and 3.09 ERA in his final 12 regular-season games.",
      "During the playoffs, Manaea went 2-1 with a 4.74 ERA and 19 strikeouts in four starts covering 19 innings as the Mets made a surprise run to the National League Championship Series.",
      "A nine-year major league veteran, Manaea is 77-62 with a 4.00 ERA in 198 starts and 30 relief appearances with Oakland (2016-21), San Diego (2022), San Francisco (2023) and the Mets. He pitched a no-hitter for the A\u2019s against Boston in April 2018.",

      "The hopes of many NFL teams will start taking shape this week as the league\u2019s annual scouting combine begins in Indianapolis",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The hopes of many NFL teams will start taking shape this week as the league's annual scouting combine begins in Indianapolis.",
      "As usual, there will be plenty to debate.",
      "There doesn't appear to be a clear-cut No. 1 overall pick or a top quarterback yet. Scouts are still trying to determine whether Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter would be more productive as a shutdown cornerback, a playmaking receiver or both.",
      "But the combine gives each team more insight into how the 329 prospects will be evaluated heading into the draft that will be held from April 24-26 in Green Bay.",
      "Here's a look at what could lead the discussions between players arriving in town Tuesday and the conclusion of workouts Monday.",
      "Hunter could be the most intriguing draft prospect in combine history because of his versatility. Some consider him both the draft's best cornerback and best receiver.",
      "While he's scheduled to work out Friday with defensive backs, organizers invited him to spend an extra night and work out Saturday with the receivers, making him the first true two-way player in combine history.",
      "Could he follow the lead of other top prospects and skip the on-field drills? Sure. Or he might choose to create the biggest buzz of the week by working out at both spots. The first indication could come Thursday when he's expected to meet with reporters.",
      "The two former Pac-12 rivals will share the big stage again this week \u2014 even if neither actually participates in Saturday's on-field drills as they try to be the first quarterback selected in April.",
      "They took very different journeys to Indy.",
      "Ward had one scholarship offer coming out of high school and parlayed a successful career at FCS school Incarnate Word into a starting job at Washington State. He even declared for last year's draft before re-entering the transfer portal and landing at Miami, where his decision paid off handsomely.",
      "Ward broke the NCAA's career record with 158 TD passes split between his FCS and FBS stints, led Miami to the cusp of a playoff berth and wound up a Heisman finalist.",
      "Sanders, the son of Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders seemed primed to be in this mix for years. He's accurate, mobile, possesses a strong arm and is outgoing.",
      "He's also outspoken though scouts may have bigger concerns about the influence Sanders' father could play in his pro career, and he's not expected to work out until Colorado's pro day next month.",
      "The former Georgia star could be the top edge rusher in this year's draft class, perhaps supplanting Penn State rusher Abdul Carter, should everything fall into place.",
      "First, though, Walker must answer questions about where he fits best into an NFL defense.",
      "His productivity and overall skills are unquestioned. But in college, he was listed at 6-foot-2, 245 pounds, making some wonder whether he's a better pass rusher or a better traditional linebacker. This week's numbers could help settle a debate that could linger into draft day.",
      "Jeanty looks like a virtual lock to be the top running back chosen after producing the second-highest single-season rushing total in FBS history. He has the combination of power and breakaway speed teams typically covet.",
      "The question is how high will he go?",
      "Many teams have opted to wait for running backs to slide, and they undervalued the position in free agency, too. But last year's big free agent acquisitions \u2014 Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Josh Jacobs \u2014 all had big seasons and it could change this year's decisions.",
      "Johnson didn't have the final college season he envisioned after winning a national championship primarily because a bruised shoulder and a turf toe limited him to eight games.",
      "When healthy, Johnson is among the best at his position.",
      "Teams will likely spend extra time making sure he's ready to start on time. If so, Johnson should be a top-15 pick and could move into the top 10 with a good time in the 40.",

      "\u201cSuch an extraordinary number of skating icons have really never been put together like this \u2014 like past champions and current champions and even hopefuls all supporting the cause,\u201d 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano, who is emceeing the event, told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday. \u201cIt says so much about our figure skating community and how tight knit we are and the support that we have for each other.\u201d",
      "Twenty-eight members of the figure skating community were among the 67 people killed when an Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines flight and crashed into the Potomac River on Jan. 29.",
      "Monumental Sports & Entertainment, U.S. Figure Skating, DC Fire & EMS Foundation and the Greater Washington Community Foundation are putting on the tribute, a two-hour show that Boitano said could be five hours long given how many stars of the sport are set to take part.",
      "\u201cEverybody \u2014 everybody \u2014 wants to be involved in this,\u201d Boitano said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of sadness and mourning. This is a show about hope and inspiration and supporting families in need. I think it will be an inspiring evening to definitely support the people who have lost loved ones \u2014 but at the same time with the skating community rebuild from this void that we have now.\u201d",
      "Two-time U.S. champion Amber Glenn, 2024 world champion Ilia Malinin, and some of the most recognizable members of the sport, including Johnny Weir, Kristi Yamaguchi and Scott Hamilton, were already committed to the event, which will air live on the Peacock streaming service and locally in the Washington area on Monumental Sports Network, with NBC showing an encore performance March 30.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 08:26:27 -0500",
    "summary": "No. 13 N",
    "story": [
      "No. 13 N",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Sonia Citron was down to the final frantic seconds, her top-ranked Notre Dame team down three and on the verge of its first loss since November. There was just enough time to launch a contested 3-pointer over N.C. State's Aziaha James.",
      "The ball dropped cleanly through, sending Citron's jubilant teammates to mob her while leaving James walking in fists-clenched disbelief.",
      "Yet James later had her own highlight-reel response, a transition layup in which she smoothly took the ball around her back to change hands and avoid a strip attempt by Olivia Miles during the 13th-ranked Wolfpack's clinching run in the second overtime.",
      "Big shots. High-level guard play. A packed house and a national spotlight beyond. The Wolfpack's 104-95 victory in the double-OT classic Sunday had it all in what turned out to be the latest showcase moment for the sport, down to former NBA great Magic Johnson weighing in on social media in real time about a game that seemingly didn't want to end.",
      "\u201cThat means there's more eyes on our game,\u201d Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey said, referencing ESPN's \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d show being at Reynolds Coliseum.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the viewership was where it needed to be. ... We were just excited to have the opportunity to play, No. 1. But again, just bringing a lot of attention to the women's game, to the ACC, is always something that's a positive.\u201d",
      "The late-season stakes were already compelling enough for the game. The top-ranked Fighting Irish (24-3, 15-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) had won 19 straight games to reach No. 1 for the first time under Ivey, and a win would allow them to clinch the league's regular-season title outright.",
      "Then there was N.C. State (22-5, 14-2), aiming to keep alive its chances of at least sharing that regular-season title while also chasing its first win against a No. 1-ranked team at home since 1978.",
      "The buzz had already built coming into Sunday. Wolfpack fans had lined up hours before doors opened at the venerable campus arena. Seven WNBA teams had scouts on hand for a game featuring Notre Dame's backcourt of Hannah Hidalgo and Olivia Miles battling the N.C. State backcourt featuring Saniya Rivers \u2014 a versatile guard with length \u2014 and a gifted, explosive scorer in James.",
      "The Irish and Wolfpack went on to provide a captivating show, a reminder that there\u2019s talented players and teams eager to take the baton from last year\u2019s stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese that had been at the forefront of the sport\u2019s rapid rise in popularity.",
      "Beyond Rivers and James (20 points), N.C. State\u2019s Zoe Brooks went for a career-high 33 points while repeatedly challenging Hidalgo (26 points). And as the game wore on on its way through 21 ties and 21 lead changes, it began to feel bigger than merely a single game on the league's regular-season schedule.",
      "By the end, Wolfpack players were mobbing each other on the court to celebrate a draining-but-thrilling win. And it wasn't long before they took that party to the campus Memorial Belltower to celebrate with fans \u2014 the site where N.C. State marked the unexpected double Final Four by its men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams last spring.",
      "\u201cStarting from this morning, I was honestly getting really emotional this morning when I found out that the students were camping out at like 10 p.m. last night,\u201d said Rivers, who came within an assist of a triple-double. \u201cYou think back and it's just like: people usually don't even like women's basketball. But it's just evolving ever since a year or two ago, and everybody is starting to get more involved.\u201d",
      "Wolfpack coach Wes Moore said the team had come by to pass out doughnuts to fans waiting in line beforehand.",
      "\u201cI mean, it was a lot of fun,\u201d Moore said. \"That's what I told our players: \u2018You worked hard to put yourself in this position. Now enjoy it.\u2019 ... And it was everything you could hope.\u201d",
      "And that included getting a couple of big-time shots, too.",
      "The first came from Citron, who had 21 of her 23 points after halftime along with that OT-forcing 3 that had Johnson to excitedly posting on X: \u201cWow wow wow.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt actually didn't work out exactly as planned, but I knew the ball in my hand and i had to shoot it,\u201d Citron said, adding that she \u201cwasn't open how I was supposed to be.\u201d",
      "It didn't matter, just like Miles' running-back attempt to stop James' jaw-dropping score in the second OT.",
      "Sporting a bandage over her right eyebrow from earlier in the game, James smoothly took the ball around her body, handing it from her left hand to her right as Miles ran by, and then back to her left for the finish without breaking stride.",
      "The layup sent Wolfpack fans into a shocked roar. Johnson was just as impressed, calling it \u201cunbelievable\u201d in his post on X.",
      "\u201cThis has been the best women's college basketball game this season!\u201d he added.",
      "It was hard to argue otherwise.",

      "BORMIO, Italy -- Emily Harrop wasn\u2019t fast enough going downhill on skis to get near the podium in Alpine skiing.",
      "But she\u2019s proving tough to beat going uphill.",
      "The French athlete has earned the moniker \u201cqueen of ski mountaineering\u201d after making the switch at the age of 20 and will be the favorite to win gold when the sport makes its Olympic debut at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Games.",
      "Harrop has won all four World Cup sprint races this season, the last of which came Saturday at an Olympic test event in Bormio, the venue for next year\u2019s ski mountaineering \u2014 or skimo \u2014 events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to come here a year before to test it out, it was really exciting for all of us,\u201d Harrop said after her victory. \u201cI think everyone had in their minds this year the test event, so I\u2019m really glad to have gotten to the end of this day with a big confidence boost with this win.\u201d",
      "Harrop, who grew up in France to English parents, followed her win up with a second-place finish in Sunday\u2019s mixed relay, alongside Thibault Anselmet.",
      "The 27-year-old Harrop is a four-time world champion in relay and team events and has also won the overall and sprint World Cup titles in each of the past three seasons.",
      "Ski mountaineering makes athletes first go up the mountain, before coming back down.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you combine cross-country skiing with Alpine skiing. You kind of sprint up a mountain with your skis on, and then ski down a mini Alpine course,\u201d said Cameron Smith of the United States.",
      "In sprint races, the ascent is mostly made on specialized skis covered with so-called climbing skins \u2014 which improve traction against the snow \u2014 and partly made on foot in ski boots. Once the competitors reach the top of the course, they switch to downhill skiing to descend down the mountain again.",
      "At the Olympics, 18 male and 18 female athletes will compete in individual sprint races and a mixed relay.",
      "A sprint race normally only lasts about three minutes \u2014 a much shorter version of other ski mountaineering events such as vertical (uphill only) and individual races, which can last well over an hour but are not part of the Olympic program.",
      "That means athletes have had to change their training routine to focus more on the action-packed Olympic formats.",
      "\u201cMy training changed a lot because the races are short and we are doing a lot of gym, a lot of short intervals,\" said Oriol Cardona Coll of Spain, who won the men\u2019s sprint as well as the mixed relay with Ana Alonso Rodriguez. \"We changed a lot the preparation and it worked.\u201d",
      "The course in Bormio will be at the foot of the iconic Stelvio slope, which will also host the men\u2019s Alpine skiing events.",
      "And, as one athlete summed it up, the setup involves a bit of everything: an ascent on skins from the start, followed by steps climbed on foot while carrying skis on the back, then another short ascent before taking off the skins and skiing 70 meters downhill, through raised banks and steep curves.",
      "The mixed relay differs slightly in that there is another descent halfway through the longer course, which is raced twice \u2014 in alternating order \u2014 by each member of the team.",
      "While the races are fast, the transitions where athletes have to take their skis or skins on and off means they have to be mentally focused as well as physically prepared.",
      "\u201cI tell people we just practice taking our skis on and off a lot,\u201d said American Jessie Young, who finished 10th in the relay together with Smith.",
      "While the sprint is explosive and fun to watch, there are some that say it is not true ski mountaineering.",
      "\u201cI think the sprint is a really fun, really fast, spectator friendly event. It\u2019s very different, it\u2019s almost a different sport than some of the long ones,\u201d U.S. racer David Sinclair said.",
      "Many athletes in Bormio agreed that it differs greatly from the sport\u2019s traditional epic Alpine climbing, but they feel it will serve as a good introduction to ski mountaineering.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like saying the 100 meters isn\u2019t a real race. It\u2019s true that when someone goes out running, they don\u2019t only do 100 meters normally, but I think it\u2019s the most followed event in the Summer Olympics,\u201d Italy\u2019s Nicol\u00f2 Ernesto Canclini said. \u201cThen there had to be this compromise for skimo to get into the Olympics. \u2026 Hopefully in the future there will be the more classic races too.\"",
      "When asked whether he prefers the sprint or the longer races, Canclini said: \u201cMy favorite is when I\u2019m without a race number and I just go up into the mountains and stop at a rifugio (mountain lodge) for a nice beer, that\u2019s the best ski mountaineering for me.\u201d",
      "For Canclini, next year\u2019s Olympics will be even more special as the races will be held on home snow.",
      "Canclini, a two-time world champion, grew up in Bormio and lives about 300 meters from the slope.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great emotion to be racing at home,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a youngster I was an Alpine skier, so having seen all the greats race here on this slope, I dreamed of also racing here. Then I changed sport, and in the end I still got to race here.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s a great satisfaction and feeling.\u201d",
      "Canclini\u2019s grandparents, parents and other family and friends were at the bottom the slope to cheer him on at the weekend.",
      "Unfortunately, Canclini tripped during his ascent on foot in the qualifiers, losing about three seconds at the top as his skis became trapped in the strap holding them to his back. He failed to make it to the quarterfinals by less than a second.",
      "\u201cEveryone said to me, \u2018better that it happened this year than next\u2019,\u201d Canclini said with a laugh. \u201cBut it would have been even better if it hadn\u2019t happened at all.\u201d",

      "Boxing is the pride of Jamestown, which is based around the fishing industry and also known for being home to many boxing stars. But like most sports in Ghana, boxing has often been seen as for men only, and women are discouraged from taking part.",
      "But Quartey persisted.",
      "And last year, at age 27, she became Ghana\u2019s first female world boxing champion and the first woman to travel the world as a member of the West African nation's national team.",

      "But when last November Quartey defeated British boxer Sangeeta Birdi in Jamestown\u2019s main boxing area, winning the WIBF World Super Bantamweight title, crowds of friends and supporters from the neighborhood celebrated wildly, seemingly forgetting about the prejudice against female boxers.",
      "Ghanaian media pronounced her win \u201chistory,\u201d but Quartey is quick to point out that she is by no means the first female boxer in Ghana.",
      "\u201cThere were women in boxing before I ventured into boxing,\u201d she said. But they weren\u2019t allowed to travel outside the country, she added.",

      "In Ghana, she said, \u201cfemale boxers do not receive much support and it is difficult to keep training.\"",

      "\u201cEven for the male boxers, when they fight with non-Africans, it\u2019s very difficult for them to win, because they have a lot more facilities and equipment than we do,\u201d she said.",

      "Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter is creating a distinctly different atmosphere as this year's NFL scouting combine begins",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Travis Hunter will arrive at the NFL's annual scouting combine listed as a cornerback.",
      "By the end of this week, he could be so much more.",
      "Hunter's emergence as potentially the top defensive back and the top receiver in this year's draft class has created an unprecedented situation with workouts about to begin.",
      "Many will be watching to see if he opts to work with the defensive backs, the receivers, neither or perhaps both at the invitation of NFL Football Scouting president Jeff Foster.",
      "\u201cTo my knowledge he\u2019s the first guy who has ever done that,\u201d Foster told The Associated Press. \u201cBut we have to assign him to a group and the defensive backs come first. We made him the offer to stay overnight and work with the receivers, so we are projecting him as a defensive back and a wide receiver. But we had to assign him to a group, logistically.\u201d",
      "The Heisman Trophy winner's answer could come before the scheduled workouts for Friday and Saturday. He's expected to speak with reporters Thursday.",
      "Doing double duty in Indianapolis usually comes with a different kind of significance on Memorial Day weekend when a race car driver tries to complete both the Indianapolis 500 and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 in North Carolina on the same day.",
      "This time, though, it could happen on the football field.",
      "Hunter could choose to follow the trend of top-rated draft picks opting out of some or all of the work on the field, waiting instead until Colorado's pro day to give NFL scouts some tangible measure of the talent he possesses in the only town that's hosted the combine.",
      "If he does try both, though, it seems unlikely Hunter would be asked to repeat some of the drills, such as the 40-yard dash or bench press, twice. But the buzz of the first true two-way star coming to town certainly has people such as Foster contemplating options.",
      "\u201cWe'd give him that option, we could make one for him right here,\u201d Foster said when asked whether Hunter would receive a T-shirt representing both positions. \u201cIf he wants to work out as a receiver and wants a receiver's jersey, I\u2019ll do it myself if I have to.\"",
      "The truth is Foster has a whole team ready to take care of such requests. His job is to create the best environment for each of the 329 combine invitees to perform. So each year Foster sprinkles in some new wrinkles.",
      "Previous changes have included revised schedules, new workout routines and the addition of lounges for rest and recovery.",
      "This year, organizers are bringing part of the Lucas Oil Stadium turf draft prospects will use to the players' performance center. It's intended to help players get acclimated to the stadium's newest turf.",
      "\u201cOnly one other stadium has it, so a lot of these players have never been on it,\u201d Foster said. \u201cSo we're taking one of the end zones and putting that in the performance center so they can work on their starts (for the 40-yard dash). We tried to create an exact replica for the surface and the start lines.\u201d",
      "Some players and agents choose not to work out because they claim Lucas Oil Stadium is a \u201cslow track\u201d though former Texas receiver Xavier Worthy had no trouble setting a combine record last year with his 4.21-second 40. That showing helped convince the Kansas City Chiefs to use a first-round pick on Worthy.",
      "Hunter\u2019s college coach, Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders, is already advising teams not to select Hunter unless they intend to use him as a two-way player. Sanders famously split his time between Major League Baseball and the NFL.",
      "So what will Hunter do? Stay tuned.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said yes or no, but it's not something we ask the players because we want them to train right up till they get here,\u201d Foster said, acknowledging he's also seen plans change after players come to town. \u201cBut he's has earned opportunity to do both here and I'm sure fans would like to see it, too.\u201d",

      "AYIA NAPA, Cyprus -- A first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea, officials said Monday.",
      "The small, autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, hailed as the \u201cfuture of underwater surveillance\u201d will be equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to give scientists at the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute a clear picture on the effectiveness of their intricate artificial reefs designed and built using 3D printing.",
      "Made of an environmentally friendly cement mixture, the artificial reefs will be embedded with a docking station at which the AUVs can recharge and transmit collected data including video, said CMMI CEO Zakarias Siokouros.",
      "The advantage of the AUVs lies in their ability to loiter underwater for as long as a month at a time and provide a continuous flow of data while \u201cprotecting\u201d the reefs by alerting scientists to any disturbance in protected waters from illegal fishing and encroaching boats. Scientists would, in turn, notify local authorities.",
      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

      "Ambitious plans for futuristic cities have sputtered or are unfinished, including one proposed by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet in Toronto; \u201cNeom\u201d in Saudi Arabia; a project near San Francisco, spearheaded by a former Goldman Sachs trader, and Masdar City next to Abu Dhabi\u2019s airport.",

      "Apple has released a sleeker and more expensive version of its lowest priced iPhone in an attempt to widen the audience for a bundle of artificial intelligence technology that the company has been hoping will revive demand for its most profitable product lineup.",
      "The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that\u2019s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone\u2019s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.",
      "Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.",
      "All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,\u201d said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.",
      "Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven\u2019t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn\u2019t even available in some parts of the world.",
      "The delays in making the iPhone\u2019s AI \u2014 dubbed \u201cApple Intelligence\u2019\" \u2014 more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.",
      "Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn\u2019t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.",
      "Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.",
      "Apple's shares edged up during Wednesday's late mornng trading to nearly $245, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The Agriculture Department is scrambling to rehire several workers who were involved in the government's response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has devastated egg and poultry farms over the past three years.",
      "The workers were among the thousands of federal employees eliminated on the recommendations of billionaire Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency, which is working to carry out Trump\u2019s promise to streamline and reshape the federal government.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon said the administration should be more careful in how it carries out the cuts.",
      "\u201cWhile President Trump is fulfilling his promise to shed light on waste, fraud, and abuse in government, DOGE needs to measure twice and cut once. Downsizing decisions must be narrowly tailored to preserve critical missions,\u201d said Bacon, who represents a swing district in Nebraska.",
      "The bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus since the outbreak began in 2022. Most of the birds killed were egg-laying chickens, so that has driven egg prices up to a record high of $4.95 per dozen on average. The federal government has spent nearly $2 billion on the response, including nearly $1.2 billion in payments to farmers to compensate them for their lost birds.",
      "A USDA spokesperson said the department \u201ccontinues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\u201d and several key jobs like veterinarians, animal health technicians and other emergency response personnel involved in the effort were protected from the cuts. But some employees of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were eliminated.",
      "\u201cAlthough several APHIS positions supporting HPAI were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters,\u201d the department spokesperson said.",
      "Politico and NBC News reported that the jobs that were eliminated were part of an office that helps oversee the national network of labs USDA relies on to confirm cases of bird flu and other animal diseases. It wasn't immediately clear how many workers the department might be trying to rehire and whether any of them worked at the main USDA lab in Ames, Iowa.",
      "\u201cAt a time when producers are already grappling with the bird flu, the public is facing high prices, and all Americans are on edge about what broader spread of this virus could mean, the last thing the administration should have done was to eliminate these positions,\" Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. \"USDA must rehire these crucial personnel immediately.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said this week that the USDA might change its approach to the bird flu outbreak, so that maybe entire flocks wouldn't have to be slaughtered when the disease is found, but they have yet to offer many details of their plan.",

    "summary": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A bill to ban the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- The prospect of banning the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king, but some of the proposal's staunchest opposition has come from ranchers and farming groups who say they can compete without the government\u2019s help.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 one of the largest pork producers in the country \u2014 is behind the push to ban cultivated meat, saying he wants to protect ranchers and meat producers. The Republican governor signed an executive order last August to keep state agencies and contractors from procuring lab-created meat, even though it could be years before such products are on store shelves.",
      "A number of ranchers and meat industry groups are pushing back on the governor's plan.",
      "Dan Morgan is a fourth-generation cattle rancher from central Nebraska who supplies high-end beef to all 50 states and six countries. He welcomes companies seeking to produce lab-grown meat to \u201cjump into the pool\u201d and try to compete with his Waygu beef. Stifling competition in a free market should be anathema in a Republican-dominated state like Nebraska, he said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,\u201d he said, adding that the government should be limited to regulating the new product's labels and inspecting its facilities to ensure food safety.",
      "\u201cAfter that, it's up to the consumer to make the decision about what they buy and eat.\u201d",
      "Nebraska is among about a dozen states that have introduced measures to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of lab-grown products, according to . Two states \u2014 Florida and Alabama \u2014 have already enacted such bans.",
      "The target of the bills is \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d or \u201ccell-cultured\u201d meat, which is grown from the cells of animals in bioreactor steel tanks. The cells are bathed for weeks in nutrients, prompting them to grow and divide, turning them into skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissues.",
      "The push to ban cultivated meat comes well before the innovation could be considered an industry. While more than two dozen companies are working to develop such meat products, only two \u2014 Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California \u2014 have been approved by the federal government to sell cultivated chicken in the U.S. Even then, none of the companies are close to mass producing and selling the products on store shelves.",
      "In recent weeks, supporters of the Nebraska bill have shifted their arguments from industry protection to questions of safety surrounding cell-cultured meat. That includes its sponsor, state Sen. Barry DeKay, a Nebraska rancher, and Sherry Vinton, the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Both testified in support of the bill at a committee hearing earlier this week, calling cultured meat \u201csynthetic food\u201d and voicing concern about possible health implications from eating it.",
      "But it's been no secret that the push for a ban is rooted in shielding Nebraska's traditional meat industry. Nebraska tops all other states for beef production and beef exports, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.",
      "Pillen named the ban among his top priorities during his State of the State address last month.",
      "\u201cThe backers of these products are cut from the same cloth as the anti-farmer activists who want to put our agriculture producers out of business, and we need to recognize them as such,\u201d he said.",
      "The Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation, the lobbying group for the emerging cultured meat industry, disputes Pillen's insistence that it's a threat to the traditional meat industry, noting studies that show global demand for meat-based protein will double by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really a complementary component here,\u201d said Suzi Gerber, executive director of the association. \u201cSo it\u2019s a little bit mystifying to me why any individual stakeholder would see this as a threat.\u201d",
      "Several farm organizations, including Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Cattlemen and the Nebraska Pork Producers, agree they're not worried about competition from the emerging industry. Those groups prefer a sister bill that would only require they be clearly labeled as lab-grown products to separate them from traditional meat. More than a dozen states have also issued similar labeling bills, and some \u2014 like Colorado \u2014 have seen ban efforts abandoned in favor of labeling measures.",
      "Paul Sherman is an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Upside Foods in its lawsuit challenging the Florida ban. He said it's no surprise most of the proposed bans are being pushed by those with connections to traditional agriculture.",
      "\u201cI think it certainly shows that the purpose of these laws isn\u2019t about protecting public health and safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting traditional agriculture from economic competition. And that is not a legitimate use of government power.\u201d"

    "summary": "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
    "story": [
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah may soon loosen its B.Y.O.B. rules, but not in the way some might hope. The acronym has taken on a new meaning in the state Legislature: \u201cBring Your Own Blood.\u201d",
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients use their own blood for procedures or choose their own donor under a bill that passed the state House with unanimous support Wednesday, despite concerns from the American Red Cross.",
      "Directed donations, which typically involve a patient\u2019s friend or family member giving blood for their procedure, are allowed under federal law. But the requests undergo a rigorous screening process that the bill's sponsor, an outspoken opponent of vaccines, said does not give patients enough personal choice in their medical decisions.",
      "Hospitals and blood collectors like the American Red Cross currently have broad discretion to decide whether it's safe and feasible for a patient to use their own blood or that of a chosen donor. Many facilities saw a rise in requests during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns about vaccine transmission that medical professionals say are unfounded.",
      "The Republican proposal, which now heads to the Senate, makes it so Utah health providers can no longer block someone from supplying their own blood, except in emergencies. Hospitals would not be liable for any injuries or deaths that may result from using the blood.",
      "Similar legislation is being considered in Texas and was floated in past legislative sessions in Iowa and Kentucky, but did not pass.",
      "\u201cThis bill was brought to me by patients who have requested to use directed blood donation, including their own blood, at Utah hospitals and have been denied,\u201d said freshman Rep. Kristen Chevrier, the bill's sponsor. \u201cTheir situations are serious and delicate.\u201d",
      "The Republican from Highland argued patients should be able to receive blood from people they trust, rather than go through blood banks that do not disclose to patients their donor's medical history.",
      "Before her election to the Legislature, Chevrier led multiple anti-vaccine organizations that warned against taking COVID-19 shots and fought against vaccination requirements imposed by schools and employers. She and other supporters have acknowledged that the bill would let patients who are weary of COVID-19 vaccines handpick donors with a similarly unvaccinated status.",
      "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justification for such requests \u201cis not supported by any medical or scientific evidence.\u201d Vaccine components do not replicate through blood transfusions or alter a blood recipient's DNA, meaning an unvaccinated patient could not receive the COVID-19 vaccine via a vaccinated donor's blood.",
      "Requests to use blood from a known donor are often driven by a patient\u2019s preference rather than a medical need, said Daniel Parra of the American Red Cross, the largest blood collector in Utah. An increase in those requests would divert resources away from those requiring lifesaving care, he cautioned.",
      "\u201cThis bill would create unnecessary and harmful impacts on the delivery of lifesaving blood to patients,\u201d Parra told The Associated Press. \u201cWhile this bill may be well-intentioned, it offers no public health benefit and could negatively impact patient care.\u201d",
      "Kristina Pexton, a blood transfusion specialist at a Utah hospital, told lawmakers at a recent committee hearing that she worried the bill would place a strain on the system.",
      "Directed donations also carry a greater risk than the community blood supply, Parra warned. Family and friends may feel pressure to donate and might not be fully transparent about their health history, which he said increases the risk of the recipient contracting an infectious disease.",
      "There is no evidence that patients can select safer donors than the volunteer blood system provides. Still, several residents told lawmakers the choice was important to them.",
      "\u201cSomething so personal as our health care, something that is especially as personal as blood, we should always have that choice,\u201d said Gayle Ruzicka."

      "A new and massive study finds that climate change is melting the world\u2019s mountain glaciers faster than ever",
      "Climate change is accelerating the melting of the world's mountain glaciers, according to a massive new study that found them shrinking more than twice as fast as in the early 2000s.",
      "The world's glaciers lost ice at the rate of about 255 billion tons (231 billion metric tons) annual from 2000 to 2011, but that quickened to about 346 billion tons (314 billion metric tons) annually over about the next decade, according to the study in this week\u2019s journal Nature.",
      "And the last few years, the melt has accelerated even more, hitting a record 604 billion tons (548 billion metric tons) lost in 2023, the last year analyzed.",
      "The study drew on an international effort that included 233 estimates of changes in glacier weight. In all, the world's glaciers have lost more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) since 2000, according to the study.",
      "\u201cThe thing that people should be aware of and perhaps worried about is that yes, the glaciers are indeed retreating and disappearing as we said they would. The rate of that loss seems to be accelerating,\u201d said William Colgan, a glaciologist for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and one of about 60 authors of the study.",
      "Glaciers in Alaska are melting at the fastest rate of any of the 19 regions studied, losing about 67 billion tons (61 billion metric tons) of ice a year, producing the biggest net ice loss, the study found.",
      "In the past 24 years, Central Europe\u2019s glaciers have lost the highest percentage of ice of any region, now 39% smaller than they were in 2000, the paper said. Colgan said he worries most about the Alps because \u201celevated summer temperatures have been hammering the Alps. \u201d",
      "Fifteen years ago, scientists were worried most about the Andes and the Patagonia glaciers, but the Alps have shrunk so fast they could eventually disappear, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are apolitical and unbiased sentinels of climate change, and their decline paints a clear picture of accelerated warming,\u201d said Gwenn Flowers, a professor of Earth Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who also wasn't part of the study, said glaciers shrank and grew in the past for local, well-understood reasons that were not climate change. What's happening now is different and clear, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s due to greenhouse gas increases caused directly by coal, oil, and natural gas burning. ... No amount of rhetoric, tweeting, or proclamation will change that.\u201d",
      "Scambos, Flowers and other outside scientists called the assessment sobering and accurate but not surprising.",
      "Colgan said that many places \u2014 such as those in the U.S. West \u2014 are seeing extra water now from fast-melting glaciers and benefiting from that boost, but that will soon disappear as the glaciers melt beyond a point of no return.",
      "Melting glaciers contribute more to sea level rise than ice loss in either Greenland or Antarctica. Only the expansion of water as it warms plays a bigger role in sea level rise, the paper said.",
      "The overall glacier loss rate is similar, if maybe slightly less, than that found by earlier and less comprehensive studies. But this new work will probably trigger new predictions that will be even gloomier in the future because of better information and worsening warming, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re losing 5.5% of the global ice volume in just over 20 years, clearly that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cThat's going to catch up with you.\u201d",
      "The more than 600 billion tons of glacier loss in 2023 \u201csounds incredible now, but it might sound pretty normal in 10 years from now,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cMountain glaciers as a whole can flip into collective ice loss pretty darn quick.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is investigating delays and cost overruns in California\u2019s high-speed rail project",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Trump administration is once again targeting California's controversial high-speed rail project, with federal transportation officials on Thursday announcing an investigation and possible withdrawal of about $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 for a project designed to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. It was slated to cost $33 billion and be finished by 2020. But the project has been beset by funding challenges, cost overruns and delays.",
      "Now, state officials are focused on a 171-mile (275-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced, which is set to be operating by 2033. The entire San Francisco to Los Angeles line will now cost an estimated $106 billion to finish and officials hope to complete it in the next 20 years if there is money.",
      "\u201cI am directing my staff to review and determine whether the (California High-Speed Rail Authority) has followed through on the commitments it made to receive billions of dollars in federal funding. If not, I will have to consider whether that money could be given to deserving infrastructure projects elsewhere in the United States,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference in Los Angeles.",
      "President Donald Trump canceled nearly $1 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail project in 2019, during his first term. The Biden administration later restored the funding and, in December 2023, allocated $3.3 billion more.",
      "Losing that money would be a major blow to the project. The rail authority's most recent business plan counts on receiving up to $8 billion in federal money to help close a funding gap.",
      "Ian Choudri, CEO of the California\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority, which oversees planning and funding for the project, said he welcomes the investigation.",
      "\u201cWith multiple independent federal and state audits completed, every dollar is accounted for, and we stand by the progress and impact of this project,\u201d Choudri said.",
      "He said the project has created nearly 15,000 jobs and that more than 50 major structures have been completed so far.",
      "Several Republican Congress members have taken aim at the project over its costs. On Thursday, Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents 3rd Congressional District that stretches alongside much of the state\u2019s border with Nevada and includes Sacramento\u2019s northeastern suburbs, called the California high-speed rail \u201cthe worst public infrastructure failure in U.S. history.\u201d",
      "\"There is no plausible scenario where the cost to federal or state taxpayers can be justified. It is past time to stop throwing good money after bad, and we must formally end this project,\u201d said Kiley, who introduced a bill earlier this year to make the project ineligible for further federal funding.",
      "Kiley joined Duffy in Los Angeles' Union Station for the announcement of the probe. Those present were interrupted at times by booing by about 30 demonstrators. The protesters also chanted \u201cbuild the rail!\u201d and held up signs that read \u201cCA has no king\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t delay our train.\u201d",
      "Eli Lipmen, executive director of Move LA, an organization that advocates for efficient public transit systems, said the high-speed train project remains popular among many Californians.",
      "\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to start an investigation, but come on, this is a sham investigation,\u201d Lipmen, who was at Union Station during the announcement, told KABC-TV.",
      "Greg Regan and Shari Semelsberger, president and secretary-treasurer of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all the country's rail unions, said the project is the most ambitious and innovative transportation project in the country and urged Trump to become \u201ca Builder-in-Chief by bringing high-speed rail to America.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuilding ambitious projects requires bold leadership and a commitment to getting the job done. Just last year, President Trump complained that the United States does not have bullet trains similar to Japan. We agree with him that it is past time for our country to have these kinds of modern, efficient, high-capacity transportation systems,\" they said in a statement.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Marine experts have given up hope of rescuing more than 150 false killer whales that stranded on a remote beach on Australia\u2019s island state of Tasmania, officials said on Wednesday.",
      "Experts including veterinarians were at the scene on Wednesday near Arthur River on Tasmania\u2019s northwestern coast where 157 whales were discovered on an exposed surf beach on Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said.",
      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn\u2019t have success as the ocean conditions weren\u2019t allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\u201d Graham said in a statement.",
      "Marine biologist Kris Carlyon said the survivors would be euthanized.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful,\u201d Carlyon said.",
      "The department said there were 136 survivors on Wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours.",
      "The inaccessibility of the beach, ocean conditions and challenges to getting specialist equipment to the remote area complicated the response.",
      "The young whales weighed as little as 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), while the adults weighed 3 metric tons (3.3 U.S. tons).",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",
      "Clark declined to speculate on why the latest pod might have stranded. Carcasses of dead whales would be examined for clues, he said.",
      "A helicopter reconnaissance on Tuesday afternoon determined that there were no other whales within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the stranded pod, he said.",
      "Some could have been stranded for as long as 48 hours by early Wednesday.",
      "Arthur River local resident Jocelyn Flint said her son had discovered the stranded whales around midnight while fishing for shark.",
      "She said she had gone to the scene in the dark hours of the morning and returned after dawn but the whales were too big to attempt to refloat them.",
      "\u201cThe water was surging right up and they were thrashing. They\u2019re just dying, they\u2019ve sunk down in the sand,\u201d Flint said Wednesday morning. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late.\u201d",

    "title": "'Radical change': Inside Trump's State Department takeover of USAID",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:51:03 -0500",
    "summary": "A State Department official told leaders of foreign aid groups that U.S. foreign aid funding was undergoing \"radical change,\" according to audio obtained by ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "ABC News obtained audio of a \"listening session\" hosted by the State Department.",
      "Pete Marocco, the Trump administration official tasked with the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), at a private \"listening session\" held at the State Department earlier this month with dozens of aid groups -- some on the brink of financial collapse -- made a request prior to the start of the meeting, according to multiple people who were in the room: that everyone stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.",
      "Inside the Loy Henderson Conference Room, representatives from aid organizations, industry groups, and foreign embassies -- reeling from the administration's sweeping freeze on foreign aid and the unraveling of USAID -- dutifully rose to their feet.",
      "The aid groups were there in the hope that Marocco would provide answers on the future of foreign assistance. After the Pledge, Marocco outlined the Trump administration's foreign aid plans, defending what he called a \"total zero-based review,\" and arguing that some areas of foreign aid required \"radical change\" before taking questions from those in attendance, according to an audio recording of the private meeting obtained by ABC News.",
      "Multiple sources who attended the Feb. 13 meeting described the mood in the room as \"deeply uncomfortable,\" saying that some of the attendees who were representing groups teetering on bankruptcy were left \"traumatized\" by the tone and the lack of specific details.",
      "During the discussion, a representative for World Vision, a global Christian humanitarian organization, asked Marocco about the impact of the freeze, noting that aid groups like his had been forced to bankroll U.S. government-funded programs with private money while awaiting overdue payments to be unpaused.",
      "\"Will the spigot open? We've gotten waivers, but the PMS system isn't operating, so we're bankrolling U.S. government-funded programs out of private money,\" said Edward Brown, the vice president of World Vision, which provides poverty alleviation, disaster relief, and child welfare in nearly 100 countries.",
      "Marocco responded that following President Donald Trump's executive order halting foreign aid, some transactions were still being processed, prompting his team to \"seize control\" of the payment system to stop them -- leaving some groups without payments that, weeks later, had still had not arrived.",
      "\"As far as payment, one of the reasons that there have been problems with some of the payments is because, despite the president's executive order, despite the secretary's guidance, we still had nefarious actors in the agencies that were trying to push out hundreds of illegal payments,\" Marocco said. \"And so we were able to seize control of that, stop them, take control of some of those people, and make sure that that money was not getting out the door.\"",
      "Marocco suggested that payments for organizations with existing contracts would resume the following Tuesday.",
      "\"I feel confident we're going to have that pretty good by Tuesday of next week,\" he said. \"That does not mean everybody's going to be caught up on everything that they want. But I think that our payment system will probably be fluid at that point.\"",
      "But Tuesday came and went, and many groups say they were still on the edge of bankruptcy -- prompting some to escalate their legal battle against the administration.",
      "On Monday, several USAID officials told ABC News that the payment system Marocco said would be fully restored was now technically operational, but that funding was still moving at an extremely slow pace and that many of the programs that were granted waivers to continue operations had still not received any money.",
      "USAID officials said the lack of funding has rendered many of the exempted programs inoperative. Some have resorted to using stockpiled resources, but because these programs have been cut off from federal support for weeks, most report that they have few funds left and don't anticipate they will be able to function for much longer, according to the officials.",
      "On Friday, after a federal judge cleared the way for the administration to proceed with its plan to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the U.S. and around the world, the Trump administration moved forward with its effort to dismantle USAID, telling all but a fraction of staffers worldwide that they were on leave as of Monday.",
      "In a court-ordered affidavit filed last Tuesday, Marocco wrote that the agency \"has authorized at least 21 payments\" for grants, loans, and other foreign aid executed before Trump's inauguration \"that are in total worth more than $250 million and are expected to be paid this week.\"",
      "As of Monday, it was not clear whether those payments had been made.",
      "When reached for comment, World Vision would not confirm to ABC News if payments had resumed, but told ABC News they were \"complying with the executive order that pauses U.S. foreign assistance funding -- with potential waivers for emergency food and lifesaving humanitarian assistance -- for the next 90 days, while programs are reviewed for alignment with the current administration's foreign policy.\"",
      "In one tense moment during the listening session, a senior Democratic Senate staffer pressed Marocco on whether, once the payments resumed, they would include reimbursements for work incurred before the Jan. 24 freeze.",
      "\"When payments resume, will they include work incurred before Jan. 24 in the payments forthcoming on Tuesday?\" asked the staffer, who, when reached for comment by ABC News, asked not to be named our of fear of retribution.",
      "Marocco would not guarantee that government-contracted work that occurred before the freeze would be reimbursed, stating that the Trump administration would only cover \"legitimate expenses\" -- and noting that the administration's definition of a legitimate expense may differ from the groups in the room.",
      "\"We will be looking at those,\" Marocco said. \"What we consider to be legitimate may not be the same thing that other people consider to be legitimate, but we're going to.\"",
      "The staffer attempted to follow up, arguing that if the work had been incurred before the freeze, \"it was legitimate at the time, right?\"",
      "\"We've moved on to the next person,\" Marocco responded.",
      "In his affidavit filed on Tuesday, Marocco conveyed the scope and status of the government's aid freeze. He wrote that, since Trump signed the executive order for a 90-day freeze, USAID had terminated nearly 500 grants and contracts. He said the agency \"has not quantified\" the total cost of those programs.",
      "As of Tuesday, the State Department had terminated more than 750 foreign assistance-funded grants and contracts of its own and had suspended nearly 7,000 more, Marocco wrote.",
      "Marocco used the meeting with the organizations to paint a dire picture of U.S. foreign aid, claiming it had \"devolved into a fiscal cycle of dependency, of presumption, arrogance, and frankly, folly, that is just astonishing.\" He dismissed past reform efforts as ineffective, arguing that officials had merely \"nibbled around the edges\" rather than addressing what he saw as systemic failures.",
      "He insisted the review was necessary to force difficult conversations about \"what these programs are actually doing\" and whether they should continue at all. And he framed the overhaul as part of President Trump's broader effort to reshape Washington's approach to foreign assistance.",
      "\"The American people deserve better. They require better. And President Trump has promised better,\" he said, criticizing aid decisions made \"behind closed doors in Congress, in small groups in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Marocco told those gathered that the administration's review extended beyond USAID and would encompass a range of federal agencies, including NASA, the Patent and Trademark Office, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM).",
      "\"If there is a tax dollar that is going out to a foreigner, we need to gain control of that and understand what it is we're trying to achieve with our partners,\" he said. \"We want to identify all of that. We want to fix it. That's the goal.\"",
      "Marocco made clear that the new foreign aid structure would be tied to Trump's political priorities.",
      "\"With the Secretary of State, you will be in line,\" Marocco said. \"The foreign assistance review, you will follow the president's foreign policy objectives. Or you will not be spending money abroad.\"",
      "He told the aid groups in the room they needed to justify their programs.",
      "\"You need to think about convincing someone -- perhaps one of the women who is in my mother's Bible study,\" he said. \"You need to think about somebody who's working at a McDonald's in Mississippi. You need to think about a grad student in Harlem.\"",
      "Marocco also told those gathered that if they wanted funding to continue, they needed to ask themselves, \"Does it give the president real influence? Does this actually give the president national security and foreign policy influence abroad?\"",
      "If it doesn't, he said, \"I would say there is a slim chance that this actually is achieving anything that is worthwhile for American foreign policy.\"",
      "The Trump administration has received widespread condemnation from Democrats in Congress over its effort to slash foreign aid programs. \"What Trump and Musk have done is not only wrong, it's illegal,\" Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said earlier this month during a news conference outside USAID headquarters. \"USAID was established by an act of Congress, and it can only be disbanded by an act of Congress. Stopping this will require action by the courts and for Republicans to show up and show courage and stand up for our country.\"",
      "The Feb. 13 meeting came as the legal battle over the aid freeze was escalating. Last week, a coalition of aid groups asked a federal judge to intervene, arguing that the freeze violated existing funding agreements and had caused \"catastrophic\" harm to their humanitarian missions. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali issued a temporary restraining order halting the freeze, but aid organizations said their funding remained locked, leaving them scrambling to keep operations afloat.",
      "Late Tuesday, Trump administration attorneys filed court papers arguing that their interpretation of the judge's order allows the freeze to largely remain in place. The aid groups fired back Wednesday, urging the court to enforce the ruling.",
      "\"The court should not brook such brazen defiance of the express terms of its order,\" they wrote in the filing.",
      "Judge Ali, a Biden-era appointee, wrote Thursday that while Trump administration officials had \"not complied\" with his order, he would not hold them in contempt of court.",
      "But he warned those officials not to buck what he characterized as his \"clear\" directive to lift their \"blanket freeze\" on aid disbursements.",

    "title": "Democrats slam incoming FBI deputy director, Trump ally Dan Bongino",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 17:49:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Dan Bongino, the former Secret Service agent turned Fox News host and conservative podcast personality, is set to be the next deputy director of the FBI.",
    "story": [
      "Bongino \"won't say no to any immoral or unethical act,\" Sen. Adam Schiff wrote.",
      "Dan Bongino, the former Secret Service agent turned Fox News host and conservative podcast personality, will be the next deputy director of the FBI -- a choice that is drawing criticism from Democrats as another one of President Donald Trump's allies moves into a leadership position.",
      "Trump named Dan Bongino, a 2020 election denier, as deputy FBI director on Sunday to serve under newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel. Bongino, who left Fox News in 2023, hosts the popular right-wing and pro-Trump podcast called \"The Dan Bongino Show,\" which ranks among Apple's top 10 news podcasts.",
      "On Monday morning, a very emotional Bongino told his show's listeners that he was sitting at home watching TV when Trump called him to let him know he was going to appoint him as the deputy director of the FBI. Bongino told listeners that he wanted the deputy FBI director job.",
      "\"I got a call from the president, and he couldn't have been nicer, and obviously, keep the contents of it between us, but I think you get the gist about what it was about and I kind of broke down a bit,\" he said. \"This is now real.\"",
      "Typically, the position of FBI's deputy director is held by a career agent -- something Bongino is not. The FBI's deputy director is responsible for the day-to-day operations and running the agency. The position does not require Senate confirmation.",
      "Democrats have expressed outrage at the pick of Bongino as a leader in the agency, concerned that Trump could use his allies leading the agency to go after his adversaries.",
      "\"Trump installs another loyalist who won't say no to any immoral or unethical act,\" Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff wrote of Bongino on X, adding that his appointment degrades law enforcement agencies and public safety.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy wrote on X that \"Trump has chosen grifters to lead the FBI.\"",
      "\"Kash Patel sells 'K$SH' branded merch, vaccine reversal pills. Dan Bongino's entire show is telling listeners the world is ending so they buy the dozens of survivalist products he sells,\" Murphy wrote on X.",
      "Bongino defended his appointment and said the job as the FBI's deputy director is \"unquestionably nonpartisan.\"",
      "\"I'm going to ask you a simple question, have you seen what I did before I came here,\" Bongino said on his podcast. \"I'm committed to service. People play different roles in their lives: People are dads, people are soccer coaches. People are cops and military officers and military-enlisted people. People are carpenters, people are plumbers. We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set.\"",
      "Bongino joins an agency -- like many others -- undergoing changes under the Trump administration. In a message to the FBI workforce last week, Patel announced his intention to \"reduce the footprint\" of the FBI in \"the National Capital Region,\" including by \"reallocating personnel to the field offices and Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville [Alabama].\" One source told ABC News this could include as many as 1,500 agents and others from Washington being relocated.",
      "The FBI, Bongino said, belongs to the American people and will work to restore trust in the agency. Bongino has said the FBI is \"lost, broken\" and \"irredeemably corrupt,\" when talking about the raid on Trump's Palm Beach home in 2022.",
      "\"Every single DNA cell in my body is going to be dedicated towards keeping this homeland safe, no matter what, no matter what, that's my job,\" he said. \"We're going to reestablish faith in this institution, the good people that are doing their job, hitting the streets, developing sources. We'll have your back. We are going to reestablish faith in this institution.\"",
      "The son of a plumber and a supermarket employee, Bongino grew up in Queens, New York, and started his career as a New York Police Department officer in the 1990s.",
      "Bongino said in his 2013 book, \"Life Inside the Bubble,\" that joining law enforcement was a \"dream of his\" and he dedicated himself to his beat.",
      "After leaving the NYPD, Bongino joined the Secret Service where he rose to the ranks and joined former President Barack Obama's protection detail.",
      "He said he was compelled to run for Congress in Maryland in 2014 after leaving the service because of \"the fog of scandals in the Obama administration,\" he told ABC News in 2013.",
      "Bongino claimed that he overheard a series of secret negotiations around the Affordable Care Act during Obama's first term, which drove him to leave the service and enter politics.",
      "That campaign was unsuccessful, but it allowed Bongino to develop a platform to speak on conservative issues.",
      "Bongino has been an outspoken supporter of Trump, and told Fox News in 2017 that the Trump-Russia collusion investigation into the 2016 presidential campaign was a \"total scam.\"",
      "He also questioned the results of the 2020 election and claimed there were \"anomalies\" with the voting totals. Despite the numerous false allegations of fraud in the 2020 election, there has been no evidence to back them up.",
      "After Trump was shot during the 2024 campaign, Bongino was critical of the agency he now helps lead.",
      "\"They absolutely, resolutely, 100% failed,\" he said of the Secret Service on Fox News in July. He also called for the firing of then-Deputy Director Ron Rowe in addition to the then-Director Christopher Wray.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 19:12:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Efforts by a White House intermediary to push the DOJ to hire candidates with \"exceptional loyalty\" to Trump sparked clashes with AG Pam Bondi's top aide, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "The White House intermediary, Paul Ingrassia, has clashed with Chad Mizelle.",
      "As the Trump administration continues to vet potential candidates for top posts within the Justice Department, a powerful White House intermediary has been pushing to hire candidates that exhibit what he called \"exceptional loyalty\" to Trump, and his efforts sparked clashes with Attorney General Pam Bondi's top aide, Chad Mizelle, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The White House intermediary, Paul Ingrassia, complained directly to Trump about Mizelle, the Justice Department's chief of staff, and suggested to the president that Mizelle is hurting Trump's political agenda, sources said. Ingrassia has since been reassigned to work with the Department of Homeland Security, a White House official familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "Trump was reelected in November after promising to rid the Justice Department of what he alleged was political bias tainting federal law enforcement. Bondi has echoed that rhetoric, issuing a directive within hours of taking office to establish a \"Weaponization Working Group\" that she said would review all of the \"politicized\" investigations previously targeting Trump.",
      "According to Ingrassia's LinkedIn page, he became \"President Trump's White House Liaison for DOJ\" in January. In private, to White House colleagues, he described himself as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" at the Justice Department, with significant authority to help interview and select candidates for senior and lower-level positions, sources said.",
      "Soon after the White House announced Ingrassia's appointment, Ingrassia began occupying an office on the fifth floor of the Justice Department, in an area typically reserved for the most senior staff in the attorney general's office, according to sources.",
      "But in the wake of Ingrassia's growing clashes with Mizelle, Mizelle took steps to have Ingrassia removed from the Justice Department and assigned to another agency -- a move that irritated some senior White House officials, sources said. Ingrassia complained to associates earlier this month that he had been locked out of his Justice Department devices, said sources.",
      "He is now serving as a liaison to DHS, helping with staffing there, the White House official told ABC News.",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News, but White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said ABC News' reporting on this matter is \"riddled with falsehoods,\" without indicating specifically what information he believes is false.",
      "\"Everyone is working as one unified team to staff the DOJ with patriots who are committed to Making America Safe Again,\" Fields said in a statement.",
      "Infighting became almost commonplace during Trump's first term, with one former Trump aide even titling his 2019 memoir about that administration, \"Team of Vipers.\"",
      "Recently, Ingrassia told colleagues that finding candidates for Justice Department roles who are loyal to Trump is a top priority for him, and he privately claimed that even rank-and-file career prosecutors within the department are corrupt, sources told ABC News.",
      "Ingrassia insisted to colleagues that anyone who worked under the Biden administration's attorney general, Merrick Garland, or under attorney general Bill Barr during Trump's first administration, should be presumed as unqualified to work for Trump's new administration, sources said.",
      "If taken literally and broadly, that could implicate nearly every current employee of the Justice Department.",
      "Sources said Mizelle resisted Ingrassia's hard-line approach, leading Ingrassia to accuse Mizelle of disrespecting him and improperly making unilateral personnel decisions, sources said.",
      "Among the candidates that sources said Ingrassia has been trying to place within the Justice Department is attorney John Pierce, who represented many of the defendants who were pardoned or had their sentences commuted by Trump's recent executive order related to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Ingrassia pushed for Pierce to take over the office within the Justice Department that helps the White House vet pardon requests, the sources said.",
      "In his first several weeks as the Justice Department's chief of staff, Mizelle himself has played a public role in promoting the Trump administration's agenda. When Bondi held her first press conference two weeks ago to announce a civil lawsuit against state leaders in New York for their immigration policies that she said value \"illegal aliens over American citizens,\" Mizelle stood on stage behind her and helped answer a question from a reporter.",
      "On Friday, Mizelle filed a publicly-released complaint with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, accusing a federal judge of \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" in his handling of a case challenging Trump's recent efforts to limit or ban transgender service members. The judge has not yet responded to the complaint.",
      "Ingrassia, before joining the Trump administration last month, led communications efforts for a nonprofit legal organization that promotes itself as \"the answer to the useless and radically leftist American Civil Liberties Union,\" and he was a writer for the right-wing website Gateway Pundit.",
      "Trump was known to repost some of Ingrassia's pro-Trump stories on social media.",
      "Ingrassia graduated from Cornell Law School in May 2022, less than three years ago, according to his LinkedIn page. For several months in 2023, he worked as a law clerk and summer associate at the New York-based McBride Law Firm, which online promotes its work fighting \"the Department of Justice's malicious prosecution and horrific treatment of January 6th Detainees.\"",
      "Between 2021 and 2023, Ingrassia also worked for the law firm led by New York attorney Marc Kasowitz, who was previously a longtime personal attorney for Trump and represented him in the government's investigations of alleged ties between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government.",
      "In January, after becoming the White House liaison to the Justice Department, he wrote on social media that the Trump administration has \"a mandate from the American people [to] rebuild trust and confidence in our justice system by realigning it with its Constitutional prerogative.\"",
      "\"The era of WEAPONIZED JUSTICE ends TODAY,\" he wrote. \"GOD BLESS AMERICA AND MAGA.\"",
      "During her confirmation hearing, Bondi assured senators that she would \"not politicize\" her office.",
      "\"I will not target people simply because of their political affiliation. Justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country,\" she vowed.",

      "Ramaswamy sought the GOP nomination for president in 2024 before dropping out to back Trump, who later tapped him to co-chair the efficiency initiative with billionaire Elon Musk.

      "\u201cI spent most of last year working tirelessly to help send Donald Trump back to the White House because it was a fork in the road,\u201d Ramaswamy said to loud cheers from the crowd. \u201cIt was a fork in the road for the future of the country.\u201d",
      "Ramaswamy joins a competitive GOP primary field to succeed Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, 78, a veteran center-right politician who is term-limited.",

      "\u201cI believe deep in my bones that Ohio can lead the way again,\" he said. \u201cIf Silicon Valley was at the leading edge of the American economy for the last 10 years, it will be the Ohio River Valley for the next 10 years.\u201d",
      "Yost issued a statement welcoming Ramaswamy to the race \u201cfor however long he sticks around.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Musk demanded federal workers detail what they did at work by the end of Monday.",
      "After a weekend of confusion, the Trump administration on Monday afternoon told federal agencies they don't have to direct workers to comply with Elon Musk's request for information about their activities at work, and that doing so is voluntary, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management -- effectively the human resources agency for the federal government -- updated agency human resources officers on a Monday call over Elon Musk's call for the Trump administration to fire federal workers who did not reply to an email asking them to submit an email listing their accomplishments from the previous week.",
      "Adding to the confusion are Trump's own comments Monday, when he told journalists in the Oval Office there was a \"lot of genius\" behind Musk's proposal, and that workers would be \"sort of semi-fired\" if they don't respond.",
      "OPM did not respond to a request for comment on the instructions given to federal agencies.",
      "In the latest effort by the Department of Government Efficiency to investigate efficiency and reduce the size of the government, employees were asked in an email from the Office of Personnel Management on Saturday to list five accomplishments over the previous week and reply by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday.",

While the White House argued in a court filing that Musk has no true power, Musk doubled down on his ultimatum Monday morning, warning that \"Those who do not take this email seriously will soon be furthering their career elsewhere.\"",
      "Trump endorsed the email while taking questions Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I thought it was great because we have people that don't show up to work, and nobody even knows if they work for the government,\" Trump said. \"So, by asking the question, 'Tell us what you did this week,' what he's doing is saying, 'Are you actually working?'\"",
      "\"And then if you don't answer like you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist,\" Trump said.",
      "Asked later Monday about the change in OPM policy, a White House official said, \"DOGE is moving fast, at the direction of POTUS, and that\u2019s exactly the point.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s all about efficiency, even internally,\" the official added.",
      "In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cEveryone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump. Any notion to the contrary is completely false.\"",
      "Mixed messages",
      "Federal employees on Saturday began receiving the OPM email with the subject line \"What did you do last week\" that demanded they list \"5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and CC your manager,\u201d according to multiple sources and an email reviewed by ABC News.",
      "The subject line came from Musk's playbook: \u201cWhat did you get done this week?\u201d is the same message he sent to the CEO of Twitter (now X) Parag Agrawal before Musk bought the company and fired the CEO.",
      "A spokesperson from the Office of Personnel Management said Saturday that \"agencies will determine any next steps.\"",
      "Yet management at multiple agencies told their staff that they were waiting on further guidance and, in some cases, told them to hold off on replying, according to multiple sources.",
      "Employees at the Justice Department were told that they did not need to respond to the OPM request, according to an email obtained by ABC News. The Defense Department told employees who received the email to \u201cplease pause any response.\u201d The Pentagon official filling in as the Department\u2019s top personnel officer said that DOD would review any performance of personnel according to its own procedures, but added that \u201cwhen and if required\u201d it would coordinate responses to OPM\u2019s email.",
      "Newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel also told staff to \"please pause any responses\" to the email.",
      "Employees at agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United States Department of Energy were told by senior staff that they were waiting on further guidance and, in some cases, told to wait for further notice before responding.",
      "NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro informed employees on Monday before OPM's guidance went out that responding to the email was optional and that not responding would have \"no impact to your employment,\" according to an email obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"Employees may have already responded or may still choose to respond. You are not required to respond, and there is no impact to your employment with the agency if you choose not to respond,\" Petro wrote in the email.",
      "Other agencies directed employees to reply. Speaking to Fox News on Monday morning, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy explained why his employees should respond to Musk\u2019s email.",
      "\u201cIf you can't come up with five things that you did, maybe you shouldn't be employed here,\u201d Duffy said, calling it an \u201ceasy task\u201d that \u201chappens in the private sector all the time.\u201d",
      "Leadership at the Treasury Department sent an agency-wide email Monday morning instructing all employees -- including those at the IRS -- to comply with OPM\u2019s email by the deadline, according to an email obtained by ABC News.",
      "However, the email still left some employees confused, particularly because it does not clarify whether failure to respond by the deadline could result in termination.",
      "Federal workers who don't follow Musk on social media could be unaware there's an ultimatum on the table. While the administration did ask federal employees to list their accomplishments, the email did not state that those who failed to respond by the deadline would be fired.",
      "Employees across agencies told ABC News they hadn't seen Musk's threats until they were asked for their reaction to them.",
      "One IRS employee told ABC News that when they asked their direct managers whether not responding would result in them being fired, they were told, \u201cWe are only to adhere to official emails and ignore any directives not communicated through official channels.\u201d",
      "Another employee in management at the IRS said staff are \"freaking out.\"",
      "Managers at the Department of Veterans Affairs told employees to respond to the email. One manager at the agency told ABC News that workers are \u201cscared.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration,\" they said. \"Everybody is afraid they are going to lose their jobs on a daily basis. There\u2019s this fear that you\u2019re going to open your email and you will be terminated.\u201d",
      "How much authority does Musk have?",
      "It is not clear if Musk has the authority to terminate employees in this manner. However, he continues to act as if he does, threatening employees on Monday morning with administrative leave if they do not return to work this week.",
      "White House lawyers attested in federal court that Musk \u201chas no actual or formal authority to make government decisions.\u201d",
      "Trump aides have also said publicly that Musk is operating in an advisory capacity as a special government employee.",
      "While Trump has said that Musk cannot do anything without his approval, the president has publicly heralded Musk as the leader of DOGE and lauded him for the job he's doing in that capacity. On Saturday, shortly before the OPM email went out, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, \"ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.\"",

    "summary": "ABC News reports on the first 30 days of billionaire Elon Musk advising President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
    "story": [
      "The billionaire is advising the president's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Elon Musk is the world's richest man. He's revolutionized electric cars as CEO of Tesla, launched rockets as head of SpaceX and seized control of a social media platform by buying Twitter for $44 billion.",
      "The South African-born businessman spent $270 million to help President Donald Trump get reelected. When Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, he empowered Musk to slash federal spending and make key decisions about the future of the U.S. as a lead adviser in the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "The following day, the Office of Personnel Management -- which acts as the government's human resources department -- directed agencies to compile a list of workers whose positions could be eliminated.",
      "By Jan. 22, there was a federal hiring freeze. All agencies were directed to put diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) staff on leave, related programs were shuttered and employees were ordered to remove pronouns from their signatures.",
      "The next several days set off confusion and panic for many workers across the country. A federal funding freeze briefly denied Head Start -- free early childhood development programs designed to help low-income households -- access to funding on Jan. 27, despite a federal judge's court order to the contrary.",
      "Then, on Jan. 28, some 2 million federal workers received an email with an offer to resign and be paid through September or risk being fired. The email subject line \"Fork in the road\" mirrored the language Musk used when he slashed Twitter's workforce in 2022.",
      "Within 30 days, DOGE gained access to personal information of millions of Americans through at least 15 federal agencies. Much of Musk's staff consisted of young engineers who moved into the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.",
      "Musk initially wanted an office in the West Wing, but told people he thought what he was given was too small, multiple people familiar with his comments told ABC News earlier this month.",
      "Only Congress has the power to eliminate entire agencies, but Musk and his team proved they can still be stripped down when they went into the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).",
      "\"DOGE was in the building. We took down our Pride flags,\" USAID contractor Kristina Drye told ABC News on Feb. 3. \"I took out any books I felt would be incriminating. No one was talking.\"",
      "At the same time, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) workers were told to stay home -- its headquarters closed and all work stopped. The consumer watchdog was created after the 2008 financial crisis and housing crash to protect American families from unfair and deceptive practices.",
      "Around 75,000 workers took the Trump administration's offer to resign, according to the White House. However, some people -- like Kansas-based Department of Agriculture natural resource specialist Nick Detter -- say they accepted within the timeframe and were fired anyway. The administration acknowledged that this has happened by mistake.",
      "\"I would never say that there's no room for improvement, efficiency in the federal government,\" Detter told ABC News. \"But in my experience over the last month with this whole thing, that's not what this has been.\"",
      "After the buyout offer closed, many federal workers said they started receiving emails and calls informing them that they were fired. Justine Beaulieu, who worked for the Department of Agriculture until last week, said she was among them.",
      "\"I was three days away from my due date on Friday when I got that termination letter. And I had my baby yesterday, right on time,\" she told ABC News. \"Paid maternity leave is off the table, and my health insurance is set to lapse at the end of this month.\"",
      "The administration has been reversing course in some cases, working to rehire the workers who manage the country\u2019s nuclear weapons and the inspection officers who worked on containing the bird flu outbreak.",
      "Musk has been designated as a special government employee. His companies Tesla and SpaceX have been awarded $18 billion in federal contracts over the last decade. Some of this money has come from agencies the president asked Musk to review, but Musk dismissed the notion that there could be conflicts of interest.",
      "\"No, because you have to look at the individual contract and say, first of all, I'm not the one, you know, filing the contract -- it's people at SpaceX,\" he told ABC News on Feb. 11.",
      "On the same day, Trump assured ABC News any possible conflicts of interest would be addressed.",
      "\"If we thought that, we would not let him do that segment or look in that area, if we thought there was a lack of transparency or a conflict of interest,\" the president said.",
      "Trump has fired independent watchdogs like Defense Department Inspector General Robert Storch.",
      "\"When you just wholesale fire people like that without giving any reasons for doing it, it sends a message that that sort of oversight, that productive oversight, isn't really valued,\" Storch told ABC News on Feb. 12.",
      "The total savings DOGE has made so far is still unclear, but the group's work has already set the stage for one of the biggest modern shakeups of the federal government.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:00:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law early on Feb. 24, 2022, under Kyiv skies still tinged black by the smoke from Russian missile strikes.",
    "story": [
      "Zelenskyy is under pressure from both Russia and the U.S. to hold elections.",
      "LONDON -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law early on Feb. 24, 2022, under Kyiv skies still tinged black by the smoke from Russian missile strikes.",
      "Three years later, the ravaged nation is still living under the extraordinary powers granted to the government in order to sustain its defensive and existential war against President Vladimir Putin's invading Russian forces. Powers that Russia is wielding to undermine the country's wartime leader.",
      "Under the Ukrainian constitution, elections -- whether presidential or parliamentary -- cannot be held while martial law is in force.",
      "Moscow has for months been seeking to weaponize Ukraine's democratic freeze, with Putin and his allies framing Zelenskyy as illegitimate and therefore unsuitable to take part in peace talks.",
      "President Donald Trump now appears to be lending his weight to the Kremlin's campaign.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump criticized his Ukrainian counterpart as \"a dictator without elections\" -- prompting widespread consternation of Trump's remarks both within the U.S. and especially among European allies.",
      "Trump also claimed -- without offering evidence -- that Zelenskyy's public approval rating was \"down to 4%.\" Recent major surveys show Zelenskyy's approval rating at above 50%.",
      "The push for new elections is \"not a Russia thing,\" Trump said. \"That's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also.\"",
      "A source close to the Ukrainian government -- who did not wish to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly -- told ABC News they believe the push is coming from those who \"believe that Zelenskyy, personally, is a problem because he is not compliant enough, he's not simply going to accept anything that they propose or anything that they demand.\"",
      "Kyiv has repeatedly warned that elections during wartime would be severely destabilizing. If Ukraine is forced into a rush and insecure election, \"We could see absolute political chaos in Kyiv,\" the source said.",
      "In reality, until now, the legitimacy argument has come almost exclusively from Moscow.",
      "\"You can negotiate with anyone, but because of his illegitimacy, he has no right to sign anything,\" Putin said of Zelenskyy in January, repeating his false claim that Ukraine's inability to hold elections in 2024 meant that the president's term had expired.",
      "The country's parliament and its speaker \"remain the only legitimate authorities in Ukraine,\" Putin said in May 2024.",
      "Foreign allies of Kyiv have dismissed Putin's claims, noting the totalitarian nature of Kremlin rule and Russia's own carefully managed electoral theater, that has kept Putin in power for more than two decades.",
      "They have also pushed back Trump's attacks on Zelenskyy, with most leaders expressing solidarity with him. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz -- for example -- said it was \"wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelenskyy democratic legitimacy.\" Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer also said it was \"reasonable\" not to hold elections during wartime, following a call with Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump's domestic allies mobilized to support the president and criticize Zelenskyy. Elon Musk, for example, said Trump \"is right to ignore\" the Ukrainian president. Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters, \"We need elections in Ukraine,\" while Sen. Josh Hawley likewise said Zelenskyy \"should hold an election.\"",
      "Most Ukrainian politicians and experts have warned that any contest held during wartime would be vulnerable to Russian interference, could not guarantee the representation of soldiers deployed on the battlefield or refugees displaced either internally or abroad, and would threaten to destabilize the state at its most vulnerable moment.",
      "Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Zelenskyy's party and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News that Putin \"wants to use an election campaign during the war to undermine stability with Ukraine.\"",
      "\"Putin is trying to push this narrative through someone in Trump's entourage,\" Merezhko said.",
      "Trump's recent attacks on Zelenskyy appear to have bolstered the latter's political position. Allies and rivals alike rallied around the Ukrainian president's office in the aftermath of Trump's broadsides.",
      "\"Only Ukrainians have the right to decide when and under what conditions they should change their government,\" former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko wrote on Facebook. \"None of us will allow such elections before the end of the war. Our enemies and even our allies may not like it, but it is true.\"",
      "Serhiy Prytula -- another prominent political figure -- urged compatriots to \"ignore that rhetoric and 'dictator' accusations from Trump.\"",
      "The source close to the Ukrainian government said that certain figures in Trump's orbit want Zelenskyy replaced by a more malleable successor, one less likely to push back on controversial American efforts to force a peace deal.",
      "\"According to their logic, the problem here is not Russia or Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it's the 'the ongoing war,'\" the source said. \"What is the mechanism for changing that, and in their view creating the conditions for someone who would be more compliant in Kyiv? It's elections.\"",
      "The source said Trump's team are wrong to think that Zelenskyy is on unstable political ground. \"They're operating under all of these false assumptions, one of which is that if you hold elections in Ukraine, it will necessarily result in the success of a candidate who is willing to bend to whatever it is that Trump is demanding,\" they said.",
      "\"I don't think that they have anyone in mind,\" the source added. \"I just think that they're confident in their ability to either create that individual in a way, or to cut some sort of private deal with someone.\"",
      "Even if the U.S. and Russia succeeded in unseating Zelenskyy in favor of a more pliant successor, \"if you end up with leadership in Kyiv that is willing to cut some sort of deal that is absolutely unacceptable to a large segment of Ukrainian society, we could see fragmentation, even of the Ukrainian military,\" they said.",
      "\"If the Trump administration pushes this government, or any Ukrainian government, too far, I think that this scenario becomes a real one, and this is certainly not in Ukraine's interest or Europe's interest, but I don't see how it's in the interest of the United States either.\"",
      "For now, there appears little in the way of a concrete challenge to the incumbent.",
      "In Kyiv, Valerii Zaluzhnyi -- the former Ukrainian commander-in-chief who is now serving as Kyiv's ambassador to the U.K. -- is widely seen as the only real potential challenger to Zelenskyy.",
      "Zaluzhnyi publicly fell out with the president and his team -- prime among them Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy's office -- in late 2023 over public comments framing the war as a \"stalemate.\"",
      "It is not clear whether Zaluzhnyi would stand for election. The former commander-in-chief has dodged questions about any future political ambitions.",
      "But a November poll by the Social Monitoring Center organization put the former general at the top of preferred potential presidential candidates backed by 27% of 1,200 respondents. Zelenskyy trailed on 16%, with former President Petro Poroshenko on 7%.",
      "A February survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) indicated diminished trust in the current president compared to the extraordinary highs of the early months of the war. But it still remains high compared to most democratically-elected leaders. Public trust in Zelenskyy among 1,000 respondents was at 57% in February, compared with 77% in December 2023 and 90% in May 2022, around three months after Russia's invasion. The latest poll showed a 5% bump in trust from December 2024.",
      "Another recent poll by the Identity and Borders in Flux project in partnership with KIIS published on Feb. 19, showed two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of Zelenskyy's actions.",
      "The KIIS poll found that trust in Ukraine's civilian government overall fell to 26% -- a decline from 52% in 2023. In contrast, those surveyed reported overwhelming 96% trust in the Ukrainian military, with 88% saying they trust Zaluzhnyi.",
      "The showdown between Zelenskyy and Zaluzhnyi ended with the former assuming an ambassadorial posting to the U.K., in which the former general has maintained a relatively low media profile and avoided any public revival of tensions with the president.",
      "The same cannot be said for Poroshenko -- another potential electoral rival -- with whom the president is now locked in a very public battle. Earlier this month, Zelenskyy signed a decree sanctioning Poroshenko and several other politically connected wealthy Ukrainians for allegedly undermining national security.",
      "Poroshenko dismissed the sanctions as politically motivated and unconstitutional. \"Why are they doing this? Hatred, fear and revenge,\" he said in a statement. \"And because they have elections. Not us. The government.\"",
      "The IBF project poll showed a much lower proportion -- 26-32% -- of Ukrainians would vote for Zelensky in an election. But that still far outpaces Poroshenko, his nearest current rival, and remains far above the 4% figure put forward by Trump.",
      "Zelenskyy has been unclear on his own political goals. In 2022, the president said he will \"definitely\" remain in his post until Kyiv achieves victory. \"After that, I don't know,\" he added. \"I'm not thinking about that now, I'm not ready.\"",
      "Peace could prove perilous for Zelenskyy if Ukrainian voters do not agree with its terms.",
      "One former official -- who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation -- told ABC News the president \"needs to blame Trump\" if Ukraine is indeed forced into a controversial peace deal.",
      "\"He cannot stop this war now and take responsibility, because for him, it will be political suicide,\" they said.",

The plan, which lays out four phases of implementation, said minors would be served a notice to appear in immigration court or deported -- if deportation orders were pending against them.",
      "ICE collected data on unaccompanied minors and sorted them into three groups: \"flight risk,\" \"public safety\" and \"border security.\" Agents were told to prioritize \"flight risk\" minors, including those who have received orders of deportation for missing court hearings, the source said of the internal document.",
      "The move from the Trump administration comes after Republicans claimed last year that the Biden administration \"lost 300,000\" migrant children -- a figure experts and advocates say lacks context.",
      "The claims come from a DHS internal watchdog report last year that found that ICE had not served notices to appear to more than 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children. The internal watchdog warned that in the past five years, more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear for their immigration court hearings, and ICE was \"not able to account\" for all of their locations.",

      "Questioned by reporters in Tampa on Monday, DeSantis touted his wife as a staunch conservative who would build on his legacy and argued that the state's first lady could pull in even more voters than he did. DeSantis won a dominant reelection victory in 2022 with a nearly 20-point margin.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s somebody that has, I think, the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles,\u201d DeSantis said of his wife. \u201cAnything we\u2019ve accomplished, she\u2019d be able to take to the next level.\u201d",

      "DeSantis' comments create a potential faceoff between the Republican governor and the president who soundly defeated him last year for the Republican presidential nomination.

      "COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- A Republican-hosted legislative town hall meeting in northern Idaho became turbulent after three plainclothes security workers forcibly removed a woman who was heckling the speakers.",
      "The incident Saturday at Coeur d'Alene High School, first reported by the Coeur d'Alene Press, quickly drew widespread attention after videos of the chaos were posted online.",
      "Now more than $93,000 has been raised for Teresa Borrenpohl's legal costs \u2014 she was issued a misdemeanor citation for battery after biting one of the men who tried to drag her from her seat \u2014 and critics are saying she was wrongfully detained. Borrenpohl is a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for a state legislative seat in 2024.",
      "\u201cShe repeatedly asked them to identify themselves,\u201d said Tonya Coppedge, who was sitting behind Borrenpohl and shot video of the disruption on her cellphone. The men, who were later identified as employees of a private security company, refused, she said. At one point, one of the men bent Borrenpohl's wrist into an extremely flexed position that appeared to be painful, she said.",
      "\u201cThey were not very kind to her \u2014 it was pretty violent and traumatic,\"Coppedge said. \u201cI think everybody was pretty disturbed by what took place.\u201d",
      "Kootenai County Republican Central Committee Chairman Brent Regan said all 450 people who attended the event were told that security officials were present and that \u201canyone who refused to respect the rights of others would be removed from the event.\u201d Borrenpohl repeatedly interrupted the speakers and was warned at least three times, Regan said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to respect the rights of the 450 people that were there to listen. One person can\u2019t stand up to bring a halt to the whole event,\" Regan said. \u201cThe disruption was more than 18 minutes that we had to stop, and that took time away from the question and answer session.\u201d",
      "Videos of the event show multiple people there were cheering or jeering, including Borrenpohl. After one of the speakers asked the jeering to stop, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris approached Borrenpohl. He introduced himself and told her to leave or she would be escorted out. Then the sheriff stepped back and began recording on his cellphone as three unidentified men approached and began grabbing Borrenpohl.",
      "Borrenpohl repeatedly asked if the men are deputies but was given no answer. She fought to remain in her seat, but the men overpowered her, carrying her out of the venue."

European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary negotiations between the U.S. and Russia last week.",

      "One European diplomat said there has been intense lobbying and arm-twisting on the rival resolutions.

      "President Donald Trump announced the appointment Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform, praising Bongino as \u201ca man of incredible love and passion for our Country.\u201d He called the announcement \u201cgreat news for Law Enforcement and American Justice.\u201d",
      "The selection places two staunch Trump allies atop the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency at a time when Democrats are concerned that the president could seek to target his adversaries. Bongino would serve under Kash Patel, who was sworn in as FBI director at the White House on Friday and who has signaled his intent to reshape the bureau, including by relocating hundreds of employees from its Washington headquarters and placing greater emphasis on the FBI's traditional crime-fighting duties.",
      "The deputy director serves as the FBI's second-in-command and is traditionally a career agent responsible for the bureau's day-to-day law enforcement operations.",
      "Bongino, 49, served on the presidential details for then-Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, before becoming a popular right-wing figure. He became one of the leading personalities in the Make America Great Again political movement to spread false information about the 2020 election.",
      "For a few years following Rush Limbaugh's death in 2021, he was chosen for a radio show on the same time slot of the famous commentator.",
      "Bongino worked for the New York Police Department from 1997 through 1999, before joining the Secret Service.

      "During an interview last fall, Bongino asked Trump to commit to forming a commission to reform the Secret Service, calling it a \u201cfailed\u201d agency and criticizing it for the two assassination attempts last year.",
      "\u201cThat guy should have been nowhere near you,\u201d Bongino said about the man who authorities say camped outside Trump\u2019s golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, before he was spotted with a rifle.",

      "Questioned by reporters in Tampa on Monday, DeSantis touted his wife as a staunch conservative who would build on his legacy and argued that the state's first lady could pull in even more voters than he did. DeSantis won a dominant reelection victory in 2022 with a nearly 20-point margin.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s somebody that has, I think, the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles,\u201d DeSantis said of his wife. \u201cAnything we\u2019ve accomplished, she\u2019d be able to take to the next level.\u201d",

      "Orange County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Ferguson sat in the courtroom about 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from where he previously presided over criminal cases, waiting for his turn to testify in his own trial. The 74-year-old judge is charged with the murder of his wife, Sheryl, for shooting her in August 2023 after the couple had been arguing about family finances while watching \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d on television.",
      "Ferguson\u2019s lawyer, Cameron J. Talley, said his client was an alcoholic and had been drinking when he began removing a gun he always carried with him in an ankle holster and went to place it on a table. Talley said Ferguson fumbled the gun, then reached to grab it and it went off with a \"bang.\"",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in shock,\u201d Talley told jurors, and called the shot an \u201caccidental discharge.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dreamlike to him, and it doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s a little drunk.\u201d",
      "The comments came during Talley\u2019s opening statement in a case that has roiled the legal community in Orange County, which is home to 3 million people between Los Angeles and San Diego. Ferguson, who is expected to testify this week, has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.",
      "Prosecutors allege Ferguson made a gun hand gesture toward his wife earlier in the evening after the couple argued about family finances while dining at a Mexican restaurant with their adult son, Phillip. Prosecutor Seton Hunt said the arguing continued at home until Sheryl Ferguson chided her husband to point a real gun at her, after which he did and pulled the trigger.",
      "Ferguson was taken into custody, and in comments captured on a police video recording, pleaded for a jury to convict him.",
      "\u201cI killed her,\u201d Ferguson is heard saying. \u201cI did it.\u201d",
      "Ferguson, who used to be a criminal prosecutor, has cried from his seat at the defense table during the trial. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eleanor J. Hunter, who is presiding over the case to avoid a conflict of interest, warned he won't be allowed to sob from the witness stand. \u201cHe's got to control himself,\u201d she said.",
      "The trial has included extensive footage from cameras worn by police officers who arrived at the couple's home in Anaheim Hills after the shooting. There is also video footage of Ferguson handcuffed at the police station following his arrest, in which he's seen sobbing and saying his son and everyone would hate him.",
      "Authorities said they found 47 weapons, including the gun from Ferguson's ankle holster, and more than 26,000 rounds of ammunition at the home. Hunt said Ferguson had ample experience and training in operating firearms, and Phillip Ferguson testified that his father taught him firearm safety, including to always point a weapon in a safe direction.",
      "Immediately after the shooting, Jeffrey Ferguson and his son both called 911, and Ferguson texted his court clerk and bailiff saying, \u201cI just lost it. I just shot my wife. I won\u2019t be in tomorrow. I will be in custody. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d according to a copy of a text message Hunt showed jurors.",
      "Ferguson was released on $1 million bail in 2023 but re-arrested last year after Hunter found he had lied about drinking alcohol in violation of his bail conditions. Ferguson was later released on $2 million bail.",
      "Ferguson has been an elected judge in Orange County for a decade but is not currently hearing cases. Under the state\u2019s constitution, a judge who faces a felony charge can continue to draw a salary but can\u2019t hear cases.",
      "Ferguson began his legal career in the district attorney\u2019s office in 1983 and went on to work narcotics cases, for which he won various awards, and was president of the North Orange County Bar Association from 2012 to 2014.",
      "He was admonished by the Commission on Judicial Performance in 2017 for posting a statement on Facebook about a judicial candidate \u201cwith knowing or reckless disregard for the truth of the statement,\u201d and for being Facebook friends with attorneys appearing before him in court, according to a copy of the agency\u2019s findings.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump holds talks this week with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations, with Trump transforming American foreign policy and effectively tuning out European leadership as he looks to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Trump also has made demands for territory \u2014 Greenland, Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal \u2014 as well as precious rare earth minerals from Ukraine. Just over a month into his second term, the \u201c America First \u201d president has cast an enormous shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and former government officials had regarded as America's calming presence of global stability and continuity.",
      "Despite some notable hiccups, the military, economic and moral power of the United States has dominated the post-World War II era, most notably after the Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union. All of that, some fear, may be lost if Trump gets his way and the U.S. abandons the principles under which the United Nations and numerous other international bodies were founded.",

      "Trump is set to host Macron on Monday, the three-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, while Starmer will be at the White House on Thursday.",

      "European leaders also were dismayed by Trump's decision to dispatch top aides for preliminary talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia without Ukrainian or European officials at the table.",
      "Another clash is set to play out at the U.N. on Monday after the U.S. proposed a competing resolution that lacks the same demands as one from Ukraine and the European Union for Moscow\u2019s forces to immediately withdraw from the country.",
      "On the minerals deal, Zelenskyy initially bristled, saying it was short on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said Sunday on X that \u201cwe are making great progress\u201c but noted that \"we want a good economic deal that will be part of a true security guarantee system for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials say they expect to reach a deal this week that would tie the U.S. and Ukrainian economies closer together \u2014 the last thing that Russia wants.",
      "It follows a public spat, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and falsely charging Kyiv with starting the war. Russia, in fact, invaded its smaller and lesser-equipped neighbor in February 2022.",
      "Zelenskyy, who said Sunday in response to a question that he would trade his office for peace or to join NATO, then angered Trump by saying the U.S. president was living in a Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space.\" Confronting Trump might not be the best approach, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe response to President Trump doing something to you is not to do something back right away. You tend to get this kind of reaction,\u201d said retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, former foreign policy aide to the late Sen. John McCain and current senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.",
      "He added, \u201cThis is part of a broader issue where I know the administration\u2019s characterizing themselves as disruptors. I think a better term might be destabilizers. And, unfortunately, the destabilizing is sometimes us and our allies.\u201d",
      "That complicated dynamic makes this week's task all the more difficult for Macron and Starmer, leaders of two of America's closest allies, as they try to navigate talks with Trump.",
      "Macron said he intends to tell Trump that it\u2019s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to show weakness to Putin during U.S.-led negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. He also suggested that he'll make the case that how Trump handles Putin could have enormous ramifications for U.S. dealings with China, the United States' most significant economic and military competitor.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t be weak in the face of President Putin. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s not your trademark, it\u2019s not in your interest,\" Macron said on social media. \"How can you then be credible in the face of China if you\u2019re weak in the face of Putin?\u2019\u201d",
      "Yet, Trump has shown a considerable measure of respect for the Russian leader. Trump said this month that he would like to see Russia rejoin what is now the Group of Seven major economies. Russia was suspended from the G8 after Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region.",
      "Trump dismissed Zelenskyy's complaints about Ukraine and Europe not being included in the opening of U.S.-Russia talks, suggesting he's been negotiating \u201cwith no cards, and you get sick of it.\u201d",
      "Putin, on the other hand, wants to make a deal, Trump argued Friday. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to make a deal. Because if he wanted, he would get the whole country,\" Trump added.",
      "The deference to Putin has left some longtime diplomats worried.",
      "\u201cThe administration should consider going in a different direction because this isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d said Robert Wood, a retired career diplomat who served in multiple Republican and Democratic administrations, most recently as the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations until December. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: Russia started this war, and trying to rewrite the narrative isn\u2019t going to serve the best interests of the U.S. or our allies.\u201d",

      "Jury selection is underway for the trial of the man accused of opening fire on a suburban Chicago Independence Day parade and killing seven people in 2022",
      "WAUKEGAN, Ill. -- The man accused of opening fire on a suburban Chicago Independence Day parade, killing seven people, is about to stand trial, nearly three years after the attack.",
      "Jury selection started Monday after several delays. Part of the reason is the erratic behavior of the defendant, Robert Crimo III, which has raised questions about what to expect at trial for the 2022 mass shooting.",
      "Opening statements are expected next week.",
      "Authorities allege a gunman perched on a roof shot at crowds assembled for a Fourth of July parade in downtown Highland Park, a wealthy suburb 30 miles (50 kilometers) from Chicago.",
      "Seven people were killed in the 2022 shooting, including both parents of a toddler. Dozens more were wounded. They ranged in age from their 80s down to a then- 8-year-old boy who was left partially paralyzed.",
      "Witnesses described confusion as shots rang out, followed by terror as families abandoned the parade route, leaving behind lawn chairs and strollers to find safety inside homes and businesses.",
      "City leaders canceled the parade the following year but reinstated it in 2024 with a memorial for the victims.",
      "Mayor Nancy Rotering has said the city doesn\u2019t want to be defined by the mass shooting. This month, she announced the parade will return in July, but without fireworks, partly because of \u201ccommunity trauma.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s parade theme reminds us that teams bring people together in support of a common goal, and that we are most resilient when we support each other,\u201d Rotering said.",
      "Killed in the shooting were: Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.",
      "Crimo was initially charged with 21 counts of first-degree murder \u2014 three counts for each person killed \u2014 as well as 48 counts of attempted murder and 48 counts of aggravated battery. But on Monday, Lake County prosecutors sought to drop the less serious aggravated battery counts. They briefly noted the move ahead of jury selection without any explanation. Lake County Judge Victoria Rossetti signed the one-page order to dismiss the charges.",
      "The Lake County state's attorney's office declined to comment Monday.",
      "Prosecutors have turned over about 10,000 pages of evidence, as well as hours of a video-taped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the shooting. But the 24-year-old Crimo has since pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal.",
      "Court proceedings have made parts of the interrogation public, and defense attorneys tried unsuccessfully to have the videos thrown out, alleging Crimo's rights were being violated.",
      "Videos show officers repeatedly asking Crimo if he understood his Miranda rights, which include the right to remain silent and have an attorney present.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard them a million times,\u201d Crimo said at one point.",
      "Prosecutors also have shown footage of a person dressed in women's clothing and identified by police as Crimo headed toward the parade route on the morning of July 4, 2022.",
      "Something that could also hurt the defense is Crimo\u2019s unpredictable behavior in court.",
      "He didn\u2019t show up to two previous court hearings, refusing to leave his Lake County jail cell. And in June 2024, when he was expected to accept a plea deal and give victims and relatives a chance to address him publicly, he showed up to court in a wheelchair and rejected the deal, surprising even his lawyers. He also fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself, then abruptly reversed himself.",
      "\u201cAnything could happen at this point,\u201d said Eric Johnson, a law professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "Crimo\u2019s defense attorneys and Lake County prosecutors have repeatedly declined comment ahead of the trial.",
      "Crimo appeared in court Monday, wearing a suit and tie, clean shaven and with his hair cut short. He occasionally looked at jurors as they were being questioned and appeared to be jotting things down on paper. His parents sat in the row behind him.",
      "Crimo's father, Robert Crimo Jr., pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct. The charges focused on how his son obtained a gun license.",
      "In 2019, at age 19, Crimo III was only allowed to apply for a gun license with the sponsorship of a parent or guardian. His father agreed, even though a relative had reported to police that his son had a collection of knives and had threatened to \u201ckill everyone.\u201d",
      "Crimo Jr., a onetime mayoral candidate and former owner of a now-closed deli, has attended his son\u2019s court hearings, making eye contact with him during hearings. He declined to discuss the case in detail.",
      "\u201cAs a parent, I love my son very much and Bobby loves this country more than anyone would ever know,\u201d he said during a phone interview. \u201cI have no further comment.\u201d",
      "Potential jurors reported to the courthouse in Waukegan on Monday. The process began slowly, first with filling out extensive juror questionnaires followed by questioning by the judge and attorneys. Only three jurors were chosen by lunch Monday. Jury selection for the panel of 12 and six alternates is expected to last several days.",
      "Opening statements are scheduled for next week in what attorneys expect to be a roughly monthlong trial. But the high-profile nature of the case could complicate efforts to find a jury. All six of those who appeared for questioning Monday morning had heard of the shooting when it first happened, even one who was traveling to Greece at the time.",
      "Survivors and their families have filed multiple lawsuits, including against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting and against authorities they accuse of negligence.",
      "Those who have spoken out declined interviews ahead of the trial. Some are expected to testify, along with police and a former school resource officer who encountered Crimo during middle and high school.",
      "Experts say attorneys will have to approach juror selection with extra care.",
      "\u201cThere is information that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Alan Tuerkheimer, who consults lawyers on jury strategy but isn\u2019t involved in the trial. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that has affected people in the community.\u201d"

      "UNITED NATIONS -- On the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Monday on dueling resolutions \u2014 Ukraine's European-backed proposal demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the country and a U.S. call for a swift end to the war that never mentions Moscow's aggression.",
      "The United States pressured the Ukrainians to withdraw their nonbinding resolution in favor of its proposal, a U.S. official and a European diplomat said Sunday. But Ukraine refused, and it will be put to a vote in the 193-nation assembly, two European diplomats said. All spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.",
      "It's a reflection of the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Donald Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the transatlantic alliance with Europe over the Trump administration\u2019s extraordinary turnaround on engagement with Moscow. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary talks last week.",
      "In escalating rhetoric, Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \u201cbetter move fast\u201d to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Trump was living in a Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space.\u201d",
      "Since then, the Trump administration not only declined to endorse Ukraine's U.N. resolution, but at the last minute proposed its own competing resolution and pressed its allies to support that version instead. It comes as Trump plans to host French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington.",
      "The U.S. also wanted a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the council presidency this month, has scheduled it for Monday afternoon.",
      "The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the 15-member Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia\u2019s veto power.",
      "There are no vetoes in the assembly, and the Ukraine resolution, which is co-sponsored by all 27 members of the European Union, is almost certain to be adopted. Its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion, but the resolutions passed there are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council.",
      "Since Russia forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Assembly has approved half a dozen resolutions that have condemned Moscow\u2019s invasion and demanded the immediate pullout of Russian troops.",
      "The votes on the rival resolutions \u2014 which have sparked intense lobbying and arm-twisting, one European diplomat said \u2014 will be closely watched to see if that support has waned and to assess the backing for Trump\u2019s effort to negotiate an end to the fighting.",
      "The very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges \u201cthe tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict\u201d and \u201cimplores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.\u201d It never mentions Moscow\u2019s invasion.",
      "Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was \u201ca good move.\u201d",
      "The Ukraine's resolution, meanwhile, refers to \u201cthe full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation\u201d and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions \u201cadopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "It singles out the assembly\u2019s demand that Russia \u201cimmediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\u201d",
      "It stresses that any involvement of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia\u2019s forces \u201craises serious concerns regarding further escalation of this conflict.\u201d",
      "The resolution reaffirms the assembly\u2019s commitment to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and also \"that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.\u201d",
      "It calls for \u201ca de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine\u201d and it reiterates \u201cthe urgent need to end the war this year.\u201d",

      "The Secret Service agent who leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot has died",
      "BELVEDERE, Calif. -- Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained haunted by memories of the assassination, has died. He was 93.",
      "Hill died Friday at his home in Belvedere, California, according to his publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. A cause of death was not given.",
      "Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder's chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "Hill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy's death, saying he didn't react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save the president.",
      "\"If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,\" a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. \"And I'll live with that to my grave.\"",
      "It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened.",
      "On the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza.",
      "Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine.",
      "Zapruder's film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulled himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off.",
      "Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination.",
      "The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller \"In the Line of Fire,\" about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill.",
      "Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family.",
      "Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times.",
      "\"If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,\" Hill said.",
      "\"You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?\" Wallace asked.",
      "\"The third shot, yes, sir,\" Hill said.",
      "\"And that would have been all right with you?\"",
      "\"That would have been fine with me,\" Hill responded.",
      "In his 2005 memoir, \"Between You and Me,\" Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career.",
      "In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" where Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally start the healing process.",
      "\"I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he's what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,\" he said. \"It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.\"",
      "Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books \u2014 including \u201cMrs. Kennedy and Me\u201d and \u201cFive Presidents\u201d \u2014 about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021.",

      "A Texas pipeline company has sued Greenpeace accusing the organization of defamation, disruptions and attacks during protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline",
      "MANDAN, N.D. -- A Texas pipeline company's lawsuit accusing Greenpeace of defamation, disruptions and attacks during protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline goes to trial in North Dakota on Monday, in a case the environmental advocacy organization says threatens free speech rights and its very future.",
      "The lawsuit stems from the protests in 2016 and 2017 over the oil pipeline's planned Missouri River crossing, upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe has long argued that the pipeline threatens its water supply. Of the thousands of people who protested the project, hundreds were arrested.",
      "Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access allege trespass, nuisance, defamation and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International and its American branch, Greenpeace USA. The lawsuit also names the group's funding arm, Greenpeace Fund Inc.",
      "The jury trial in state court in Mandan, North Dakota, is scheduled to last five weeks.",
      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer alleges Greenpeace tried to delay construction of the pipeline, defamed the companies behind it, and coordinated trespassing, vandalism and violence by pipeline protesters. The lawsuit seeks millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The Dakota Access Pipeline was completed and has been transporting oil since June 2017.",
      "Greenpeace International said it shouldn't be named in the lawsuit because it is distinct from the two U.S.-based Greenpeace entities, operates outside the U.S., and its employees were never in North Dakota or involved with the protests.",
      "Greenpeace USA said the plaintiffs have failed to back up their claims in the years since the protests.",
      "Earlier in February, a judge denied motions by Greenpeace to throw out or limit parts of the case.",
      "Representatives of the environmental organization founded over 50 years ago said the company just wants to silence oil industry critics.",
      "\u201cThis trial is a critical test of the future of the First Amendment, both freedom of speech and peaceful protest, under the Trump administration and beyond,\u201d Greenpeace USA Interim Executive Director Sushma Raman told reporters. \u201cA bad ruling in this case could put our rights and freedoms in jeopardy for all of us, whether we are journalists, protesters or anyone who wants to engage in public debate.\u201d",
      "Greenpeace USA helped support \u201cnonviolent, direct-action training\u201d on safety and de-escalation at the protests, Senior Legal Adviser Deepa Padmanabha said.",
      "Energy Transfer is arguing that \u201canyone engaged in a training at a protest should be held responsible for the actions of every person at that protest,\u201d Padmanabha said. \u201cSo it's pretty easy to see how, if successful, this kind of tactic could have a serious chilling effect on anyone who might consider participating in a protest.\u201d",
      "Earlier in February, Greenpeace International filed an anti-intimidation suit in the District Court of Amsterdam against Energy Transfer, saying the company acted wrongfully and should pay costs and damages resulting from its \u201cmeritless\" litigation.",
      "An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the lawsuit is about Greenpeace not following the law.",
      "\u201cIt is not about free speech as they are trying to claim. We support the rights of all Americans to express their opinions and lawfully protest. However, when it is not done in accordance with our laws, we have a legal system to deal with that,\u201d Energy Transfer spokeswoman Vicki Granado said in a statement.",
      "The company filed a similar case in federal court in 2017, which a judge dismissed in 2019. Soon after, Energy Transfer filed the state court lawsuit now headed to trial.",
      "Energy Transfer launched in 1996 with 20 employees and 200 miles (320 kilometers) of natural gas pipelines. Today the 11,000-employee company owns and operates over 125,000 miles (200,000 kilometers) of pipelines and related facilities.",

    "story": [
      "Birkenstocks may be cool enough for Barbie but the sandals do not qualify as works of art, a German court has ruled.",
      "The company had claimed its footwear could be classified as art and so was protected by copyright laws in a case it put forward to stop rivals selling copycat versions of the cork-soled sandals.",

    "story": [
      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.",
      "Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",

      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",

      "\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.",
      "The provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.",
      "Instead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.",
      "Trump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.",
      "However, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.",
      "Zelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.",
      "On Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".",

      "She argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\""

    "title": "Can Canadians get the world drinking tree sap?",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:11:34 GMT",
    "summary": "The largest producer of maple syrup now wants you to drink the sap, which it calls maple water.",
    "story": [
      "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.",
      "We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.",
      "What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.",
      "A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.",
      "\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.",
      "Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.",
      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He founded the company back in 2013 with business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",
      "\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"",
      "However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.",
      "Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.",
      "His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.",
      "He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.",
      "\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.",
      "Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.",
      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",
      "Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:40:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",

    "summary": "Members of the University and College Union are taking industrial action over potential job cuts",
    "story": [
      "Staff at Dundee University have begun three weeks of strike action over the institution's plans to cut jobs due to a potential \u00a330m deficit.",
      "The University and College Union (UCU) Scotland said that 74% of its members had backed strike action, on a turnout of 64%.",
      "More than 450 UCU members, comprising academic and support staff, will strike each weekday for the next three weeks. It is expected lectures and classes will be cancelled.",
      "Dundee University said the action was \"premature\" and had been voted for by less than 10% of the university's staff.",

      "\"I don't believe that we should punish the people of Rwanda and punish the people of other countries when we disagree with their leaders,\" he said after last week's concert in Kigali.",
      "In recent weeks, M23 rebels, backed by Rwanda, have seized the two largest cities in the mineral-rich east of the DR Congo.",
      "There is evidence Rwanda has sent 4,000 troops across the border to support the rebels.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of civilians are now destitute having fled their homes, and shocking violence, including the rape of children, has skyrocketed.",

      "But Legend defended his decision to headline the Move Afrika event in Kigali, which was run by the Global Citizen NGO and attracted thousands of fans from across the continent.",
      "He said he was not being paid for the performance but felt it was his duty to help \"grow touring capabilities\" on the African continent, which is often overlooked by international stars on so-called world tours.",
      "\"I'm aware of what's happening [in DR Congo] and I'm aware of the calls there have been for me to not do this show, but I really believe that the mission of Move Afrika is still important,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Delighted fans at the sold-out show agreed, but the social media backlash was ferocious enough to force Legend to delete an Instagram post he had made promoting the event.",
      "Belgium-based activist Denise Zanesa had argued that \"performing under the banner\" of Rwanda \"would be akin to collaborating with oppression itself\", in a message posted to X (formerly Twitter).",
      "It was a sentiment echoed by others, including Simone Umba in the US, who wrote in a TikTok video caption: \"So are we ready to talk about Rwanda's use of Black American culture in their soft campaigning to normalise their terrorising of eastern Congo?\"",
      "Taking a political stance would have been nothing new for the star.",
      "Legend is outspoken in his criticism of US President Donald Trump. He also severed ties with former mentor Kanye West when he ran for president, suspecting it was part of a wider Trump campaign to \"siphon\" black people's votes away from the Democrats.",
      "The debate over Rwanda's relationship with popular global figures is also not new.",

      "\"And for a woman like me, who grew up in the 40s and 50s when women weren't supposed to have opinions and get angry, acting gave me a chance to play angry women with opinions, which as you know is a stretch for me,\" she joked.",
      "\"I'm a big believer in unions, they have our backs, they bring us into community, and they give us power. This is really important right now when workers' power is being attacked and community is being weakened.\"",

      "A man who has admitted harassing Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Tweedy must wait to be sentenced, a judge has said.",
      "Daniel Bannister, 50, of no fixed abode, has been remanded in custody pending sentence and appeared, via an online link, at a magistrates' court hearing in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on Monday.",
      "The case had been listed for sentencing but a lawyer told District Judge Arvind Sharma that no sentence could be passed because a pre-sentence report relating to Bannister's health had not been finalised.",
      "Tweedy, 41, who is also known as Cheryl Cole and as Cheryl, was living in Buckinghamshire when Bannister offended.",
      "Bannister had admitted harassment, breaching a restraining order, and attempting to breach a restraining order, at an earlier stage of proceedings.",
      "He raised the issue of sentencing at Monday's hearing and asked the judge: \"Is there no option for the sentence to go through today, even though there has not been a report?\"",
      "The judge told him imposing a sentence without a report would not be \"fair\".",
      "He said the case would be reconsidered on 14 March.",
      "\"I appreciate it has been delayed quite a lot,\" said the judge.",
      "\"But I cannot really do anything fairly with you until I know what your health situation is.\"",
      "He added: \"I am sure you have got better things to do than sit in prison.\"",
      "The judge told Bannister that if a prison term was imposed, time spent on remand while awaiting sentence would count as part of that term.",
      "Bannister had previously appeared in court on 30 January, at another hearing listed for sentencing.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:04:27 GMT",
    "summary": "As Drake drops a new album after his Not Like Us diss track humiliation - what's his strategy?",
    "story": [
      "\"Gimme a hug, Gimme a hug!,\" pleads Drake on one track from his new album, $ome $exy $ongs 4 U.",
      "After the month and year he's had, perhaps it's no surprise.",
      "As rap battle humiliations go, the rapper's defeat by hip-hop's lyrical supremo Kendrick Lamar has become a cultural phenomenon, and saw Drake sue Universal Music Group.",
      "Lamar's diss track, Not Like Us, a viral hit since last summer, accuses the Canadian star of inappropriate relationships with underage girls - claims Drake denies.",
      "First the track swept up at the Grammys, with Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 dancing along. Then came Lamar's Super Bowl half-time show, with a record 133.5 million people estimated to have tuned in to watch the whole stadium sing the lyrics accusing Drake of being a paedophile.",
      "And on Friday the single finally topped the UK charts nine months after release, matching its stateside success.",
      "But rather than lay low, Drake, the dominant chart-topper of the past 15 years, is coming out fighting with an \"intriguing\" strategy after being put in a \"cultural chokehold\", says crisis PR expert Mark Borkowski.",
      "As Lamar grins through the bright lights of his victory lap, Drake's chosen to sidestep the beef - bar one embittered freestyle denouncing fake friends - and instead focused on repositioning himself.",
      "Currently on tour in Australia, he's been loosening up, gently leaning into the softer image he's spent recent years trying to toughen, even performing an intimate karaoke bar set of early sultry hits.",
      "Then on Valentine's Day, almost a week after the Super Bowl, he returned with $ome $exy $ongs 4 U, a full-length collaboration with PartyNextDoor that harks back to his R&B-tinged rise.",
      "Full of trap-soul beats teasing romantic escapades, Borkowski calls it a \"calculated retreat into the familiar, comfortable territory\" of the more sensitive \"certified lover boy\" persona that dominated Drake's initial breakthrough albums like Thank Me Later and 2011's Take Care.",
      "In the 2010s, Drake was the most-listened to Spotify artist, racking up more than 28 billion streams, with his most popular song, One Dance, played 1.7 billion times alone.",
      "Even if Not Like Us saw the crown slip, he remained the fourth most-streamed artist on the platform last year.",
      "\"His reputation might be in tatters within certain circles, but commercially, he remains bulletproof,\" says Borkowski.",
      "Commercial chameleon",
      "It helps that Drake harnessed mass appeal by sampling a myriad of genres in his pomp of pop-rap dominance.",
      "His catalogue -  boasting 45 UK top 10 singles, (including six number ones), and over 300 hits in the US Hot 100 - inhaled fumes of grime, dancehall and afrobeat.",
      "The camouflage from his status as a commercial chameleon means that \"despite the clear L and Not Like Us becoming a defining moment in rap history, Drake keeps moving\", says Borkowski.",
      "On $ome $exy $ongs 4 U's track Gimme A Hug, Drake seems to wave the white flag in his Kendrick battle saying:  \"[Expletive] a rap beef, I'm tryna get the party lit.\"",
      "It's worked, too, at least commercially. According to Billboard, Apple Music confirmed $ome $exy $ongs 4 U's release broke first-day R&B streaming records on the platform.",
      "In Friday's official UK charts, the album came in at number three.",
      "Three of its songs also made up the top 40 - including Gimme A Hug.",
      "Critical reception, meanwhile, has been mixed. Vulture described it as \"yearning pre-beef star finding his footing\", with a sound \"conscientiously re-establishing\" his earlier aesthetic.",
      "Rolling Stone's Jeff Ihaza, in a three-and-a-half-star review, spoke of a \"return to form from an artist whose back was truly against the wall\".",
      "Pitchfork's Alphonse Pierre, however, was scathing, lambasting \"a desperate album from one of rap's most notorious narcissists\".",
      "Regardless, Borkowski is clear on the strategy - Gimme A Hug, like the album, isn't a response track, it's an abdication from the fight. A recognition that Drake can still win, just on a different rap turf.",
      "Nostalgia trip",
      "So, where is Drake headed if he's conceding the rap battlefield? The answer is the nostalgia play.",
      "Weeks before the release of this new album, Drake opened his Australian tour by coming out on stage in a vest with smoking bullet holes. He closed the show by declaring: \"My name is Drake, I started in 2008, I came all the way from Toronto, Canada. The year is now 2025, and\u00a0Drizzy Drake is very much still alive.\"",
      "For music and culture journalist Manu Ekanayake, the new album revisiting his early 2010s era, when he \"sounded confident in what he was trying to do\", mirrors this.",
      "But, he warns, \"after three recent albums of being the least convincing tough guy in town, can he really go back to being the singing party boy?\".",
      "He's certainly going to try. Days after the album drop, Drake announced an unprecedented three-night takeover of London's Wireless Festival this summer, with each night's set focusing on a different part of his career.",
      "Organisers confirmed the dates sold out in record time. For Borkowski, this is a \"masterclass in reframing\".",
      "\"Drake is curating his own legacy, reminding people of his longevity, and shifting the conversation away from defeat and back to dominance.\"",
      "Ekanayake is less sure of the long-term potential: \"Now at 38, it all sounds very different from when he was in the first flush of success in his 20s.",
      "\"What seemed before like a young artist giving hip-hop a new approach for a new generation, now sounds like it's the end of something.\"",
      "But, ultimately, Borkowski goes back to the bottom line. \"His fans aren't music purists, they're Drake fans - here for the lifestyle, the vibes, and the brand. And as long as he delivers that, nothing truly sticks.\"",
      "The true power move? Securing Live Nation for his rebrand, says Borkowski.",
      "\"It's about staying relevant, ensuring the hits don't stop and keeping the machine running. In today's music industry, perception is currency, and despite the setbacks, Drake is still cashing in.\"",
      "Good thing too, as Lamar's Not Like Us shows no signs of slowing down on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "The Compton star's already made US history by becoming the first rapper to have three albums in the Billboard top 10 - with his latest release GNX also number one.",
      "The battle may be over, but the chart war has just begun."

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 15:37:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Daniel Craig's replacement will be Amazon's biggest decision after gaining control of the franchise.",
    "story": [
      "\"Who'd you pick as the next Bond?\"",
      "That was the question posed by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos this week to his 6.8 million followers on X.",
      "It is Bezos who will now have the final say on the next 007. He asked for suggestions alongside a screenshot of the BBC News story about his company gaining creative control of the famous spy film franchise.",
      "The choice of Daniel Craig's replacement will now be Amazon MGM Studios' biggest decision.",
      "So let's take a look at what direction the company could take, and who is in the frame.",
      "If the replies to Bezos's call out are anything to go by, Henry Cavill is the (online) people's choice.",
      "The former Superman actor, who has said he \"would love to play Bond\", was widely regarded to have been the runner-up years ago when Craig landed the part for the first of his five 007 films, 2006's Casino Royale.",
      "The movie's director Martin Campbell told the Express last year that Cavill's audition was \"tremendous\" and that \"if Daniel didn't exist, Henry would have made an excellent Bond\".",
      "There was just one problem. \"He just looked a little young at that time back then,\" added Campbell.",
      "Longstanding Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who announced on Thursday they were stepping down, have previously shot down the idea of a younger Bond.",
      "\"Remember, Bond's already a veteran,\" Wilson said in 2022. \"He's had some experience. He's a person who has been through the wars, so to speak. He's probably been in the SAS or something.\"",
      "Amazon may have different ideas - but at 41, Cavill could ironically now be considered too old, especially if he stays for a string of subsequent movies.",
      "The next most frequently mentioned names in the replies to Bezos were Tom Hardy, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Idris Elba.",
      "Taylor-Johnson, 34, known for roles in Kick-Ass and Kraven the Hunter, was at one stage rumoured to have been offered the job, but no announcement ever materialised.",
      "Kraven bombed at the box office last year, though, which could count against him.",
      "The bookmakers had Happy Valley actor James Norton listed as their favourite on Friday.",
      "Speaking on the red carpet at last weekend's Bafta Awards, Norton, 39, described the speculation around him becoming Bond as \"so weird and bemusing\" yet \"fun\".",
      "'Bring it younger'",
      "Mark O'Connell, author of Catching Bullets: Memoirs of a Bond Fan, told the BBC he thinks Amazon - and whoever they choose as the next director - will go for a younger actor than in previous times, and he hopes they buy British again.",
      "\"Tom Hardy would be great, [but] I think he's, dare I say, too old,\" he said of the 47-year-old Mad Max actor.",
      "\"There's a lot of guys that keep getting quoted [and] I'm like, they're too old.",
      "\"I think Amazon's going to bring it younger. I think we're looking at early 30s. Paul Mescal is a good name. Kingsley Ben-Adir, who's one of the Kens in the Barbie movie, I'd keep an eye on him - he's got a sort of [Sean] Connery swagger about him.",
      "\"Harris Dickinson, who's a British actor doing well in Babygirl with Nicole Kidman at the moment, he's very British,\" O'Connell added.",
      "\"I hope they stick with the British DNA and origins of the role. I think they would be foolish to move away from that. But time will tell.\"",
      "Bond has been played by two non-British actors in the past - Australian George Lazenby and Irishman Pierce Brosnan. So don't rule out the likes of fellow Irish stars Mescal, Oscar winner Cillian Murphy, Aidan Turner, or Aussie Jacob Elordi.",
      "Could Amazon break the mould and go for the first American Bond? If so, Austin Butler has been mooted.",
      "Other Brits who have been shaken but not stirred into the mix include Challengers star Josh O'Connor, 34, and Babylon's Stuart Martin, 39, as well as White Lotus actor Theo James, who is 40.",
      "Callum Turner, Richard Madden, Will Poulter and Nicholas Hoult have also been suggested, among others.",
      "'Teasing Bond's masculine ego'",
      "Since Bond - originally the creation of author Ian Fleming - hit the big screen in 1962, first played by Scotsman Sean Connery, his hair and eye colour have changed, not to mention his accent.",
      "But so far, the character's skin colour and gender have remained fixed.",
      "That is apart from when Lashana Lynch briefly took over the 007 title from Craig's Bond in No Time to Die.",
      "\"James Bond can be of any colour, but he is male,\" Broccoli said in 2020.",
      "\"I'm not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that.\"",
      "She added: \"He should be British, so British can be any [ethnicity].\"",
      "Bridgerton actor Rege-Jean Page has been mooted alongside Ben-Adir as a possible first non-white Bond, as have Lucien Laviscount, Paapa Essiedu, Damson Idris, Riz Ahmed and Aaron Pierre.",
      "If Bezos does break Broccoli's rule and go for a woman, Cynthia Erivo would be a popular choice.",

      "A year after the release of Daniel Craig's final film in the franchise, Amazon bought the series' parent company MGM. Since then, very little has happened.",
      "That finally changed on Thursday, when Amazon announced a new joint venture that will see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.",

      "\"So I'm very hopeful, and dare I say even a little bit excited, that they're going to do something with the franchise that will be interesting nonetheless.\"",
      "Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond.",
      "Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand.",
      "\"They went off and made that sequel trilogy, and whether you like it or not, it got made rather quickly,\" he notes. \"There wasn't a three-year wait between films.\"",
      "However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products.",
      "Narayan says he believes Star Wars has become \"creatively redundant\" since the explosion in productivity.",
      "\"The Star Wars TV series have been very hit and miss \u2013 Andor is fantastic, The Mandalorian is OK, I haven't seen Skeleton Crew... but there are very disparate creative voices going on there,\" he notes. \"So this is the worry, you need the correct creative people to run the show.\"",
      "Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.",
      "The subsequent decline in Marvel's popularity arguably owes much to fan fatigue, something which won't have been helped by the huge number of story strands they had to keep up with.",
      "Both cases, Marvel and Star Wars, highlight the risks of brand expansion, which can cause long-term damage for short-term financial gain.",
      "Fans will be hoping any Bond extensions will be better than 2023's dubious game show 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession's Brian Cox, which was poorly received.",
      "The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,\" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.",
      "\"As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity.",
      "\"But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.\"",
      "Character origin stories",
      "One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.",
      "Cruella, an extension of the 101 Dalmatians villain, and Wonka, of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have both been hugely successful film spin-offs in their own right in the last five years, with Emma Stone and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet respectively bringing the characters and worlds to a whole new audience.",
      "It's not hard to imagine the popularity of a similar film or show based on famous Bond villains such as Jaws, Oddjob, Blofeld, Goldfinger or May Day - all big brands in their own right.",
      "\"I mean, why has nobody made Moneypenny?!\" laughs Derek Bond. \"There's a great series to made about her and her journey.",
      "\"Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.\"",
      "But Zaritsky notes: \"I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.\"",
      "Not everyone is a fan of the idea. \"This is quite possibly the WORST thing to happen to this franchise,\" tweeted Griffin Schiller of Film Speak after Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"James Bond was more than your average franchise. It had class, prestige, they were indie films made as blockbusters... now? It'll be milked dry. It's truly the end.\"",
      "Broccoli has been seen as a steward of the brand throughout her tenure; a safe pair of hands who protected the traditions of the original character.",
      "That may not necessarily have been compatible with Amazon, who were presumably looking to buy a brand rather than only a film franchise, in an effort to maximise profit.",
      "\"It does tend to be a slightly older generation that it skews to, and there's a whole generation of people who have not experienced a James Bond film, and now, I wonder if they will,\" Bond says.",
      "In her own tenure, Broccoli has made efforts to keep attracting young audiences in other ways, however, such as selecting popular young artists such as Billie Eilish to sing the theme songs.",
      "A repositioning of of the brand could see Amazon try to take the franchise in a direction that appeals more to a younger audience as well as an American market, which is culturally slightly cooler on the Bond brand than the UK.",
      "\"I think it's quite bad news for the franchise, and British film as a whole,\" movie journalist Hannah Strong told Radio 4's PM following Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"It's the premier British film property, and I think the control reverting to an American company, not least one that hasn't shown that much commitment to great cinema, is probably quite a worrying sign.\"",
      "That said, Amazon will be aware that Bond makes a huge amount of money as it currently is - and that altering the core product itself in a way that appeals more to an American audience would be a huge risk.",
      "Strong added: \"When Amazon bought MGM, Barbara Broccoli was quite outspoken about the fact she was finding it difficult to come to a middle ground with Amazon. I suspect the middle ground involves an awful lot of money.\"",
      "The biggest decision remains who will replace Craig in the leading role.",
      "Broccoli previously said James Bond could be any race, but that he would remain male. That guarantee may no longer stand now she is has handed over the reins, although her approach was widely regarded as sensible and Amazon are unlikely to rock the boat too much.",
      "How long could it be until we see the first new Bond product? Zaritsky suggests Amazon won't wait around, although the first thing to launch may not be a film.",
      "\"It could be with merchandise, or in the form of fan outreach,\" he says. \"Whatever it is, I think we might see something extremely fast.\"",

      "The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna.",
      "Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street.",
      "After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read.",
      "Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom.",
      "1) Unwavering support from Rihanna",
      "As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister.",
      "The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers.",
      "Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day.",
      "On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books.",
      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",

      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",

      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",

      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 01:43:21 GMT",
    "summary": "EastEnders stars and commentators reflect on times the soap tackled social taboos over 40 years.",
    "story": [
      "Over its 40-year run, EastEnders hasn't just been plot twists, emotions and gripping \"doof doof\" cliffhangers.",
      "It's also tackled social issues head-on, its stars say.",
      "The series has \"done more to create social awareness\" on these issues \"than probably any documentary\", says actor Ross Kemp, who plays leather-jacket-wearing Grant Mitchell.",
      "Kemp, who is hosting a BBC documentary on the history of the soap, says over the last four decades EastEnders has been able to take on subjects many feel are taboo - and it continues to do so with recent storylines including topics such as spiking.",
      "\"You can introduce those things through a continuing drama, a soap like EastEnders, and inform more people than you possibly would do with a government campaign,\" he says.",
      "First gay kiss",
      "On 17 November 1987, EastEnders aired a kiss between characters Colin Russell (played by Lord Michael Cashman) and his boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the side of the head.",
      "There was a \"furore\" after the kiss was broadcast, Kemp recalls, adding \"it wasn't even a kiss on the lips\".",
      "Former actor Lord Cashman speaks to Kemp about the reaction during the new documentary EastEnders: 40 Years on the Square.",
      "\"The media went berserk,\" he says. \"There were calls for 'this kind of filth to be taken off our screens'.\"",
      "Lord Cashman says \"it was a weird and dark time,\" adding \"there was rampant homophobia\".",
      "In 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was introduced, which banned places like schools and libraries from \"promoting homosexuality\".",
      "Lord Cashman's character Colin went on to share the first mouth-to-mouth kiss between two gay men on a British soap with character Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan) in 1989.",
      "However, the former actor, later an activist and politician, recalls the reaction from fans: \"There was one guy and he said: 'I used to stand behind the sofa so that my mum and dad couldn't see me looking at you and I knew I wasn't alone.' It made a difference.\"",
      "Domestic violence",
      "According to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.",
      "One example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).",
      "Actor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"",
      "The actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.",
      "Though one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.",
      "Colourism",
      "Molly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.",
      "In February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.",
      "Colourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.",
      "Speaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"",
      "Rainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".",
      "Transgender representation",
      "In 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.",
      "Carter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.",
      "\"I understood the weight of it and I didn't take it lightly,\" the actor says, adding that despite leaving the soap in 2016, he still gets messages from fans about his character.",
      "Kemp adds that EastEnders is \"ever-evolving\" with society - and that while there will \"always be a certain crowd that will poo poo it and look down upon it\", it has made some \"landmark television\" over the last 40 years.",
      "If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can visit BBC Action Line, including for issues related to sexual abuse and violence and domestic abuse.",
      "As part of EastEnders' 40th anniversary week, BBC News will be hosting live coverage of the live episode on Thursday 20 February, which you can watch on BBC One and iPlayer, and follow on our live page.",

      "One out of every five people with epilepsy - a total of 30,000 in the UK - has uncontrolled seizures caused by brain abnormalities too subtle for the human eye to see on scans.",
      "Child epilepsy experts say the AI tool has \"huge potential\" and opens up avenues for treatment.",
      "But more studies on the long-term benefits for patients are needed before it can be licensed and used in clinics.",
      "Brain abnormalities called focal cortical dysplasia are a common cause of epilepsy, especially when medication cannot control seizures.",
      "Seizures affect people in different ways - symptoms include jerking and shaking,   becoming stiff and losing awareness - and can mean regular visits to accident-and-emergency units.",
      "Removing a small part of the brain can be a safe and effective way of stopping them - but if radiologists cannot see the tiny lesions on brain scans, diagnosis, treatment and surgery can be delayed.",
      "'Really difficult'",
      "For this study, published in JAMA Neurology, the researchers, from King's College London and University College London, fed their tool magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) scans from more than 1,185 adults and children at 23 hospitals around the world, 703 of whom had brain abnormalities.",
      "The tool, MELD Graph, was able to process the images more quickly than a doctor could - and in more detail - which could mean more timely treatment and fewer  costly tests and procedures, lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl said.",
      "The AI would require human oversight, however, and many of the abnormalities were still missed.",
      "\"It's like finding one character on five pages of solid black text,\"  Dr Wagstyl said.",
      "\"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find.\"",
      "At one hospital in Italy, the tool identified a subtle lesion missed by radiologists, in a 12-year-old boy who had tried nine different medications but still had seizures every day.",
      "Study co-author and childhood epilepsy consultant Prof Helen Cross said it had the potential \"to rapidly identify abnormalities that can be removed and potentially cure the epilepsy\".",
      "Uncontrolled epilepsy was \"incapacitating\", she said.",
      "Many of the children she sees as a consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital have had years of seizures and investigations before a lesion is found.",
      "Charity Epilepsy Action said the new AI tool's potential was \"really exciting\" and could give people faster diagnosis, but did not solve the issue of lack of specialist epilepsy nurses in England.",
      "\"It remains early days and, as always, we must proceed with caution,\" said Ley Sander from the Epilepsy Society, adding that if the tool could identify more people as candidates for brain surgery, that could be \"life-changing for many more people with epilepsy\".",
      "The researchers are hoping for official approval to use MELD Graph as a diagnostic tool - but other trials are needed first to investigate the long-term benefits for patients whose brain lesions are detected.",
      "In the meantime, the research team has made the tool available on open-source software, so it can be used for clinical research by hospitals worldwide.",

      "With the recent announcement of a judge-led public inquiry into the Nottingham attacks - which happened less than a year later - Delvin said he wanted to make sure nobody else goes through the same trauma.",
      "'Personality changed'",

      "Brenton and his brother rallied round to try and support Rudi, who also approached mental health services to try and get support.",
      "\"He [Rudi] sat at the hospital waiting to be seen - 13 hours on one occasion, five hours on the next - he was trying himself to get help through the system,\" Delvin said.",
      "\"He knew something was wrong, but again nothing came from it.",
      "\"He didn't get any help, he was never seen at the hospital, and we just carried on trying to help him.\"",
      "After a period of better health when he was living with his then-partner, Rudi's condition deteriorated again in 2018, when he started saying he had a microchip in his head and was stabbing the walls at home.",
      "Delvin said the family had been in touch with Nottinghamshire Police over their worries, including after an incident in 2019 when officers attended alongside a mental health nurse, who decided Rudi did not need to be sectioned.",
      "\"I thought at that point something was going to be done,\" he said.",
      "\"It was explained to them about his circumstances, about how he was not in control of his thoughts and he's very delusional, and we thought that this was going to be OK, but they thought that Rudi was no harm to himself and no harm to the public.\"",

      "Rudi's mental health problems continued, and in August 2022 he stabbed his father 75 times.",
      "\"That could have been me that was attacked - Rudi didn't know what he was doing,\" Delvin said.",
      "\"He was just very delusional, because he believed whatever was going on in his head. No matter what you said to him about reality, it had no effect.",
      "\"By that point the services were saying 'well, he's an adult, he needs to come in himself', [but] at that point it's too late, they've missed the opportunity.\"",
      "'Hard to comprehend'",
      "Delvin said he still felt the pain of the loss of his brother, who he said was \"more or less a superhero\" for the way he looked after Rudi.",
      "Despite the pain, he says he forgives his nephew for the \"devastating\" attack, and had been to see him in hospital.",

      "\"I've forgiven him, but it's such a turmoil of emotions that it's so hard to comprehend.\"",

    "story": [
      "An experimental trial of gene therapy has helped four toddlers - born with one of the most severe forms of childhood blindness - gain \"life-changing improvements\" to their sight, according to doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.",
      "The rare genetic condition means the babies' vision deteriorated very rapidly from birth.",
      "Before the therapy, they were registered legally blind and only just able to distinguish between dark and light. After the infusion, all parents reported improvements - with some of their young children now able to begin to draw and write.",
      "Further work is being done to confirm the early study, which appears in the Lancet medical journal.",
      "Gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness has been available on the NHS since 2020.",
      "The new work builds on that success by injecting healthy copies of a defective gene into the back of a child's eye, very early in life, to treat a severe form of the condition.",
      "Jace, from Connecticut in the United States, had the gene therapy in London when he was just two years old.",
      "As a young baby, his parents noticed something wasn't right about his eyesight.",
      "\"Around eight weeks old when babies should start looking at you and smiling, Jace wasn't doing that yet,\" says his mum DJ.",
      "She knew instinctively there was an issue and began to search for the reason, which took 10 months.",
      "After several visits to doctors and many tests, the family were told Jace had the ultra rare condition. It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.",
      "\"It was a shock,\" Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child.",
      "\"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward.\"",
      "The family was lucky to hear about an experimental trial being carried out in London - just by chance - when they were at a conference about the eye condition.",
      "Jace's surgery was quick and \"pretty easy\", his mum says. He had four tiny scars in his eye where healthy copies of the gene were injected into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery.",
      "These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, which goes through the retinal cells and replaces the defective gene. The healthy, working genes then kick start a process which helps the cells at the back of the eye work better and survive longer.",
      "In the first month following treatment, Brendan noticed Jace squint for the first time on seeing bright sunshine streaming through the windows of their house.",
      "His son's progress has been \"pretty amazing\", he says.",
      "\"Pre-surgery, we could have held up an object near his face and he wouldn't be able to track it at all.",
      "\"Now he's picking things off the floor, he's hauling out toys, doing things driven by his sight that he wouldn't have done before.\"",
      "This may not be the last treatment he needs in his life, his parents say, but the improvements so far are helping him to know the world better.",
      "\"It's really hard to undersell the impact of having a little bit of vision,\" Brendan says.",
      "No other options",
      "Prof James Bainbridge, a retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, who helped lead the trial, said giving children the chance of sight improvement this early on could make a big difference to their development and ability to interact with people.",
      "\"Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development.",
      "\"Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected,\" he said.",
      "The four children, from the United States, Turkey and Tunisia, were all born with an aggressive form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis, where a genetic fault means the cells at the back of their eyes -  that normally help distinguish light and colour- malfunction and rapidly die out.",
      "Scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye, and Great Ormond Street Hospital specialists led on giving the procedure in the trial.",
      "Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available.",
      "Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects.",
      "They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors.",
      "Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging.",
      "'Hugely impressive'",
      "According to Moorfields' doctors, the results of the tests they completed, alongside the parent's reports of their improvements, give \"compelling evidence\" that all four benefited from the treatment and were seeing more than would be expected with the normal course of the disease.",
      "Vision in their untreated eyes, meanwhile, deteriorated, as expected.",
      "Consultant eye surgeon, Prof Michel Michaelides, at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, added: \"The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives.\"",

      "US President Donald Trump has \"changed the global conversation\" on Ukraine, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said, three years on from Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "Sir Keir suggested Trump had \"created an opportunity\" to end the war, in a speech to an international summit on supporting Ukraine in Kyiv.",
      "The prime minister also appeared to contradict President Trump by saying \"Russia does not hold all the cards in this war\".",
      "Sir Keir said the West \"must increase the pressure even further\" on Russia and announced the UK would impose a new round of sanctions on the country.",
      "The prime minister said more sanctions could push President Vladimir Putin \"to a point where he is ready not just to talk, but to make concessions\".",
      "On Monday the UK government said it had imposed more than 100 new sanctions on those who continued to aid the invasion, including companies in China, which is the largest supplier of critical goods for Russia's military.",
      "Meanwhile, the Home Office has announced a move to widen travel sanctions for Kremlin-linked elites.",
      "The government has described the announcement, which also includes measures against North Korean generals accused of sending troops to fight Ukraine in Russia, as the UK's largest sanctions package since the early days of the invasion.",
      "Sir Keir said the G7 \"should be ready to take on more risk\" and a larger role in sanctioning Russian's oil giants, before speaking to leaders of the group of wealthy countries.",
      "The speech comes ahead of Sir Keir's meeting with President Trump at the White House on Thursday.",
      "He is expected to discuss the importance of Ukraine's independence, US security guarantees and European involvement in peace talks when he speaks to Trump.",
      "It is a high-stakes visits as European leaders scramble to put forward their own proposals for ending the war and keeping Russia at bay.",
      "President Trump has been pushing for a quick deal to end the war in Ukraine, and US and Russia have held initial talks, which excluded Ukraine and European countries.",
      "Trump has said he believes Russia has \"the cards\" in any peace talks to end the war because its military has \"taken a lot of territory\".",
      "There have been diplomatic tensions since President Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator without elections\" last week.",
      "Ukraine's elections are suspended under martial law, which has been in place since Russia's full-scale invasion was launched in February 2022.",
      "The prime minister talked about extra sanctions as one way to \"deliver an enduring peace\" in Ukraine.",
      "He said the other two ways were stepping up UK military support to Ukraine and bringing \"our collective strength to the peace effort\".",
      "\"President Trump has changed the global conversation over the last few weeks,\" Sir Keir said.",
      "\"And it has created an opportunity. Now, we must get the fundamentals right.\"",

      "\"Every military supply line disrupted, every rouble blocked, and every enabler of Putin's aggression exposed is a step towards a just and lasting peace,\" he told the House of Commons.",
      "Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said her party backed the government giving Ukraine \"everything they need\" - including weapons, hardware, and diplomatic muscle - to \"decide its own future.\"",

      "Earlier, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged President Zelensky to secure Ukraine's future by signing a minerals deal with the US.",
      "Johnson said he believed Ukraine would sign a \"promising\" agreement to give the US access to valuable minerals, in return for security guarantees.",
      "Zelensky had rejected a \u00a3400bn ($500bn) demand for mineral wealth, but over the weekend, US officials said they expected to sign a deal this week.",
      "In a post on X on Monday, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, said the Ukrainian and US teams were \"in the final stages of negotiations regarding the minerals agreement\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Johnson - a Zelensky ally who was prime minister when the invasion started - said claims by some Americans that Ukraine had provoked the war were \"a complete inversion of the truth\".",
      "He described Trump's comments as \"Orwellian\", and said he might as well have blamed the US for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War Two.",
      "But Johnson said it was important to focus on a minerals deal, which he called \"the great prize\" and suggested could be signed this week.",
      "He rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 09:47:13 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after the government rejected compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age.",
    "story": [
      "Campaigners have threatened the government with legal action unless it reconsiders the decision to refuse compensation to millions of women affected by an increase in the state pension age.",
      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group is demanding payouts for 3.6 million women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of changes first introduced in the 1990s.",
      "The government apologised that the changes were not communicated quickly enough but told the BBC it \"cannot justify paying for a \u00a310.5bn compensation scheme at the expense of the taxpayer\".",
      "Waspi chair Angela Madden said: \"We believe this is not only an outrage but legally wrong.\"",
      "The \"letter before action\" that has been sent to the government is a formal mechanism to allow it a chance to respond before the campaigners seek a judicial review at the High Court in two weeks time.",
      "Last year the parliamentary ombudsman recommended payouts of up to \u00a32,950 each because of a 28-month\u00a0delay\u00a0in\u00a0writing\u00a0to\u00a0inform\u00a0the women affected of the changes.",
      "Waspi\u00a0campaigners\u00a0have\u00a0claimed\u00a0women\u00a0suffered\u00a0financial\u00a0hardship\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0to rethink\u00a0retirement\u00a0plans.",
      "However in December, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall apologised for the delayed communications but said there was \"considerable awareness\" of the changes to the pension age. She said sending letters earlier would not have made a difference to their ability to make retirement choices.",
      "Her claim there was no direct financial loss could now be examined in court if the campaigners get approval for their judicial review.",
      "What is the row about women's pensions?",
      "'I want the \u00a345,000 state pension that was stolen from me'",
      "Ms Madden said: \"We will not allow the DWP's gaslighting of Waspi women to go unchallenged.",
      "\"The government has accepted that 1950s-born women are victims of maladministration, but it now says none of us suffered any injustice.\"",
      "With no compensation forthcoming she said: \"The alternative is continued defence of the indefensible but this time in front of a judge.\"",
      "The Waspi group has also launched a crowd-funding campaign to try to cover an estimated \u00a375,000 in legal fees.",
      "If the women were to win their case it is estimated it could cost the government as much as \u00a310.5bn.",
      "With government finances already under strain because of weak economic growth and higher borrowing costs, Sir Keir Starmer has said \"the taxpayer simply can't afford the burden\" of compensation.",
      "The changes were first decided in 1995 when the then-Conservative government sought to equalise the age at which men and women received their state pensions, aiming that by 2020 everyone would have to wait until their 65th birthday.",
      "However in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2010, the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition decided to speed up the changes, to reduce the overall cost of the state pension.",
      "Other countries have made similar decisions in recent years - however the UK government did not communicate its change quickly enough and the impact of that could now be examined in court.",
      "A government spokesperson told the BBC on Sunday it accepted the ombudsman's finding of maladministration and had apologised for the 28-month delay in writing to 1950s-born women.",
      "\"However, evidence showed only one-in-four people remember reading and receiving letters that they weren't expecting and that by 2006, 90% of 1950s-born women knew that the state pension age was changing,\" they said.",

      "The talks focused on \"advancing\" the negotiations and ensuring that the deal was \"balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial\", Goyal wrote on X.",
      "The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach.",
      "Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK.",

      "India is forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years.",
      "The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised.",

      "London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars.",
      "India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times.",
      "It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits.",
      "Speaking at the joint conference, Goyal said that immigration was not a part of the discussions.",
      "\"India has never ever discussed immigration in any free trade negotiations,\" he said. Reynolds added that business mobility was a \"separate issue\" from immigration.",
      "During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram.",
      "UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru.",
      "After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing agreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, it signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.",
      "It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 13:53:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Bridget Phillipson says the US thawing diplomatic ties with Putin \"brought Russians to the table\".",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump was right to re-establish links with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to set up peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, a senior Labour minister has said.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there could be \"no negotiated peace without Russia\" and that Trump's approach had brought \"Russians to the table\".",
      "The US president has faced a backlash for excluding Ukraine from talks after his aides met Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. Trump has also suggested Ukraine may be a bystander, saying it has \"no cards\" in the deal.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will meet Trump in Washington this week and press for Ukraine to be \"at the heart\" of any peace talks.",
      "Ukraine hit by largest single Russian drone attack of war on eve of third anniversary",
      "Rosenberg: How Putin and Trump shook up the world in a week",
      "I'll back Ukraine in talks with Trump, Starmer says",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson said that Trump thawing diplomatic ties with Russia and Putin was \"the right approach\".",
      "\"President Trump has brought the Russians to the table,\" she added.",
      "When asked by Kuenssberg if welcoming Putin back was the right move, Phillipson said, \"absolutely\".",
      "\"There can be no settlement, no negotiated peace, without Russia,\" she said.",
      "She added \"any lasting settlement where it comes to peace does require Ukrainian voices, President Zelensky's voice to be a central part of that.",
      "\"There can be no settlement unless we have a negotiation involving both Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"We are however, also clear of the risk that Russian President Putin poses to our interest.\"",
      "Shortly after coming to office, Trump held a phone call with Putin in which the leaders agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. It was the first phone-call to Putin by a US president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "It was a significant thawing of the US relationship with Russia. Trump's predecessor Joe Biden previously called Putin a \"murderous dictator\" and a \"pure thug\".",
      "Since the call Trump has claimed Putin wants to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine - arguing Russia did not necessarily have to negotiate a ceasefire, because it could take \"the whole country\" by force.",
      "Trump has instead turned on Zelensky in recent days, calling him a \"dictator without elections,\" claiming he was doing a \"terrible job\" and falsely suggesting he was the one who started the war with Russia.",
      "Trump's short-term goal is to stop the fighting in Ukraine. Longer term, he appears to want less US involvement, given that the country has sent tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Kyiv.",
      "The White House is pushing Ukraine to sign a $500bn (\u00a3395bn) minerals deal, which would give the US control over half of Ukraine's mineral resources - which the Trump administration describes this as \"payback\" for earlier US military assistance.",
      "The Ukrainian president had rejected the initial US proposal made several days ago, saying he \"cannot sell our state\".",
      "In a video address late on Friday, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US teams were working on a draft agreement, which \"can add value to our relations\". But he stressed that \"what matters most is getting the details right\".",
      "Sir Keir is seeking to balance support for Ukraine with keeping his working relationship with Trump.",
      "This weekend, Sir Keir assured Zelensky of the UK's \"ironclad support\" for Kyiv. The comments came in the second telephone conversation in four days between the two leaders.",
      "It comes ahead of a big week of diplomacy, as Sir Keir heads to the White House on Thursday shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron visits Washington on Monday.",
      "While making his pitch to Trump this week, Sir Keir is expected to set out a path for the UK to increase spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2030 - in line with Labour's election manifesto commitment.",
      "European countries raising defence spending and becoming less reliant on the US for has been a key demand from Trump.",
      "In his push for Nato allies to shoulder more of the security burden, Trump has suggested European nations to commit at least 5% of GDP to defence.",
      "In a speech to the Scottish Labour Conference in Glasgow on Sunday, Sir Keir said \"the US is right\" that \"we Europeans - including the United Kingdom - have to do more for our defence and security\".",
      "The UK also must stand \"ready to play our role if a force is required in Ukraine once a peace agreement is reached\", he said.",
      "Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge has called on the government to \"go further and faster\" on increasing defence spending.",
      "Earlier this week, the Liberal Democrats said there should be a national conversation on how to get to a target of 3% of GDP spent on defence.",
      "But Cartlidge refused to say how much the Tories would invest until they see the details of this year's strategic defence review.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 08:04:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Last week the Isle of Man came very close to axing a policy no UK politician dares touch.",
    "story": [
      "A pensions timebomb is ticking on the Isle of Man and the self-governing island off the UK's west coast came very close to defusing it last week.",
      "Like the UK, the island protects state pensions with the triple lock, which automatically increases the state pension each year by the maximum of three measures: price inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.",
      "The Isle of Man's government wanted to scrap the triple lock for some pensioners in its budget last week.",
      "But ministers were forced to back down following a backlash from members of the island's parliament, who argued the change was \"unfair\" on pensioners and was being rushed through without a proper debate.",
      "The U-turn is a cautionary tale for critics of the triple lock in the UK.",
      "It underlines the political difficulty of watering down the income of pensioners who tend to vote in greater numbers than younger age groups at elections.",
      "One former UK Treasury adviser told the BBC: \"It's politically too difficult to come up with a pension policy that does not involve committing to the triple lock. It's such a vulnerability in an election campaign.\"",
      "'A lose, lose, lose scenario'",
      "The triple lock was introduced by David Cameron's 2010 coalition government and has proved a reliable way of wooing the grey vote for every administration since.",
      "But it has also become steadily more expensive, as the population ages.",
      "Between 2022 and 2032, the number of pensioners in the UK is projected to increase by 13.8%, according to the ONS.",
      "Meanwhile the fertility rate is declining, suggesting there could be fewer UK-born people entering the workforce and paying taxes to cover welfare costs, including pensions.",
      "The government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said spending on pensioners is forecast to rise from \u00a3141bn this year to \u00a3182bn by 2030.",
      "In the Irish Sea, the cost pressures of keeping the triple lock are similarly intimidating politicians on the Isle of Man.",
      "With a population of about 84,000, and a declining birth rate, the Isle of Man has a higher proportion of over 65s than the UK as a whole - 22.5% compared with 19% - and forecasts show the number of retirees on the island is expected to grow.",
      "A report last year suggested, without reform, the fund that pays out the state pension could run out by 2047.",
      "In the UK, the population trends are only going in the same direction, and they look daunting for whichever party wins the next general election, due in 2029 at the latest.",
      "\"The politics here are a nightmare,\" said David Sinclair, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre - UK. \"The problem is that none of the alternatives to removing the triple lock are going to be popular.\"",
      "A return to some model of earnings link is favoured by many economists.",
      "Mr Sinclair said to keep the triple lock, government may have to take on more debt, increase the pension age, raise taxes, or potentially all of the above.",
      "\"For government it's a lose, lose, lose scenario,\" Mr Sinclair said.",
      "He said the Labour government \"will be terrified about even suggesting a cut to the triple lock\" after the outcry over its decision to withdraw the winter fuel allowance from all but poor pensioners.",
      "The government is raising the state pension by 4.1% this April, on a par with average earnings.",
      "A government spokesperson said its commitment to the triple lock was \"unwavering\" and meant \"millions will see their state pension rise by up to \u00a31,900 over this parliament\".",
      "In the Conservative camp, there have been hints of a shift in attitude to pensions.",
      "Speaking on LBC, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the Conservatives were \"going to look at means-testing\" benefits, in response to a question about the state pension. Her party later insisted she was not referring to the triple lock specifically.",
      "Also, the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, has said the triple lock was unsustainable in \"the very, very long term\".",
      "A Conservative source said Stride's comments had been taken out of context and the party was committed to the triple lock.",
      "Politically sensitive",
      "Neither Reform UK nor the Greens mentioned the triple lock in their election manifestos last year, while the Liberal Democrats supported its continuation.",
      "That was no surprise given they mooted the idea in their 2010 manifesto, albeit without the triple lock tag.",
      "Two sources close to the 2010 coalition talks said what became the triple lock was a minor detail in the Tory-Lib Dem agreement, with one saying the Treasury estimated it would cost \u00a350m over a five-year period.",
      "\"Clearly the triple lock will stop at some point,\" Steve Webb, the former Liberal Democrat MP and pensions minister who implemented the policy, told the BBC. \"It was never intended to be permanent.\"",
      "Webb said it was a tool used to \"undo 30 years of damage\" to pensioner living standards, but added \"there will come a point when it's done its job\".",
      "Such is the sensitivity of the issue, few current MPs or anyone actively involved in Westminster politics are willing to talk openly about when that time might come.",
      "One MP, who did not wish to be named, said the triple lock would not be dropped anytime soon, even though there were convincing arguments for doing so.",
      "For now, there's a stubborn silence and talk of tossing out the triple lock remains taboo among this generation of political leaders.",
      "Given the backlash against the watering down of the triple lock on the Isle of Man, the MPs of the future may view what's happening on the island with some trepidation.",

      "The Crime and Policing Bill will also include measures that could see restriction orders put on people thought to be at risk of exploiting children for criminal means.",
      "Cuckooing is when the home of a vulnerable person is taken over by criminals who use it as a base for illegal activities, such as drug dealing.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said exploitation like this was \"sickening\", adding that legislation would ensure victims were \"properly protected and prevent these often hidden crimes from occurring in the first place\".",
      "\"It is vital we do everything in our power to eradicate it from our streets,\" she said.",

So they like, go out and sell your body,\" she said.",
      "Dr Laura Bainbridge, an associate professor of criminal justice at Leeds University who specialises in cuckooing, welcomed the legislation saying the criminal and civil orders currently used to charge cuckooers are not consistent across England and Wales, and the harm caused to individuals is not reflected in sentences.",
      "But she told the Today programme that there were some grey areas and that determining victims and perpetrators in a cuckooing situation can be \"very difficult to untangle\" and \"no two instances of cuckooing are identical.",
      "\"It may be the case that a vulnerable victim truly believes that say the drug dealer  is their friend and refuses to eject them from their property - thus moving them towards the offender domain - or it may be the case that the perpetrator has been forced to cuckoo a property, by say county lines gang to pay off the drugs debt, and this moves them towards the victim domain,\" she said.",
      "She added that she hopes the new law will ensure that victims are protected and not prosecuted, and that a multi-agency rather than an enforcement approach will be used.",
      "The child criminal exploitation (CCE) offence in Labour's bill is designed to target people who groom children into criminal activity, including county lines drug dealing or organised robbery, the Home Office says.",

      "That's a trick that seemed to do Alex Salmond no harm 20 years ago.",
      "Inspiration was also drawn from David Cameron, who once derided Gordon Brown as being unfit for the digital age.",

    "story": [
      "Plans to allow English whisky makers to use the term \"single malt\" have led to a backlash by Scottish distilleries and politicians.",
      "Under proposals being considered by the UK government, \"single malt English whisky\" could be used for the spirit made by a single distillery in England.",
      "However, the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) said it \"devalues\" single malts because, it claims, the English method would be simpler than the process used in Scotland.",

      "\"What Scotch whisky does is it takes the malted barley and it creates the mash, it ferments it and then it distils it at one site,\" Graham Littlejohn, SWA director of strategy and communications told BBC Good Morning Scotland.",
      "\"What the English proposal would do is to strip away the first two of those three elements and really remove the fundamental connection to place that single malt Scotch whisky has.\"",

      "When Sir Keir Starmer visits the White House next Thursday, he will be treading a fine diplomatic line.",
      "He will want to maintain his support for President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine's government. But he will also want to gain the ear of President Donald Trump over the talks he has begun with Russia to end the war.",
      "All this while keeping out of the venomous verbal crossfire between Washington and Kyiv.",
      "That will be no easy task.",
      "Transatlantic relations are in pieces. The US president has upended America's longstanding support for Ukraine and sidelined Europe in the process.",
      "US defence secretary Pete Hegseth says European security is no longer a US priority. Vice-President JD Vance attacks the very nature of European democracy.",
      "It is into this cauldron of ideological enmity that Sir Keir will seek a hearing when he meets the president and his team at the White House.",
      "So what can and should the prime minister do?",
      "Diplomats say he has one advantage over European allies, namely his permanence. Trump, they say, knows Sir Keir is one of the few European leaders who will stay in power throughout his presidency. Trump, it is said, likes the fact the prime minister has a healthy parliamentary majority.",
      "\"I get along with him well,\" Trump told the BBC a few weeks ago. \"I like him a lot. He's liberal, which is a bit different from me, but I think he's a very good person and I think he's done a very good job thus far.\"",
      "But warm words and familiarity do not pay for lunch inside the Washington beltway.",
      "What could Sir Keir offer the famously transactional president? He has already made a downpayment by offering to deploy British boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of a post-war reassurance force.",
      "This angered some European leaders who thought it premature and divisive. It also risked Europe getting excluded from discussions about more fundamental issues such as Ukraine's territory and sovereignty. But the troops offer may gain Sir Keir some diplomatic brownie points in the West Wing.",
      "The other thing Sir Keir could offer Trump is the strongest possible language he can muster promising to increase UK defence spending. Starmer is not expected to announce when he will meet his target of spending 2.5% of national income on defence. But he may talk up both the UK's commitment and his calls for other European allies to do likewise.",
      "Sir Alex Younger, former chief of MI6, told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"We need to demonstrate that we are prepared to play a role, take control of our own environment, recognise that we have got to develop our power and that has got to happen quickly.\"",
      "But diplomats say the main argument Starmer must make is to convince Trump that a fast deal on Russian terms would be against his own interests. Namely that the terms of any ceasefire - its fairness, its permanence, its safeguards - were as important as any short term cessation of hostilities. In other words, that there is no point in having a triumphant ceasefire agreement which does not survive for long, risking Trump's reputation.",
      "\"If I were Starmer, I would say to Trump that this is your chance for your place in history, the man who brought peace and ended this war,\" Lord Darroch, the former UK ambassador to the US, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"But it has to be a fair deal. If it's a bad deal, you are not going to get that praise, you are going to get a load of criticism and that will be your record in the history books.\"",
      "Key to that would be urging Trump to put pressure on Vladmir Putin by threatening to seize frozen Russian assets, increase support for Ukraine and tighten up sanctions.",
      "Huge risks",
      "But the risks of the prime minister's trip are huge. The famously thin-skinned president could take offence at Sir Keir's outright contradiction of his claim that Zelensky is a dictator. He could be irritated by Sir Keir's insistence that any European reassurance force deployed to Ukraine must have a US \"backstop\", expected in the form of aircover.",
      "The diplomatic pitfalls of cross words and cancelled press conferences will be troubling the minds of British officials as they prepare for the trip. They will be acutely aware President Emmanuel Macron of France will be in Washington before them on Monday, competing for Mr Trump's ear.",
      "Sir Keir likes to say that in these troubled times, the UK can once again become a bridge between Europe and the US. France may be keen for that role too.",
      "Another potential point of tension will be trade. Team Trump is promising to impose tariffs on UK goods entering the US that match VAT levied on American goods entering the UK. One argument the UK could make is that hitting British and European trade will make it harder for them to spend more on defence. But officials say that would be a hard argument to make to a president who thinks Europe is ripping off the US both economically and militarily.",
      "The greatest risk, however, is that no manner of charm, politics or diplomacy may touch the sides of this new administration, that there is simply no transactional offer that can bridge the vast ideological divide that now exists between Europe and the US. That may be the cold hard lesson the British delegation learns in Washington.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:30:19 GMT",
    "summary": "But Reform UK's leader appears to back President Trump's calls for elections in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not a dictator, after he was branded one by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Farage said Trump's words should be taken \"seriously\", after he lashed out at Zelensky and urged him to hold elections as part of a deal to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the Reform UK leader - an ally of Trump - said people should not take everything the US president said \"absolutely literally\".",
      "\"Zelensky is not a dictator,\" Farage told GB News. \"But it's only right and proper that Ukrainians have a timeline for elections.\"",
      "Farage suggested elections could happen before the conflict was over, saying \"there needs to be a bit of a timeline so that the Ukrainian people can vote on a peace deal\".",
      "Zelensky's five-year term as president was due to end in May 2024, but elections have been suspended since martial law was declared after Russia's invasion.",
      "There had been criticism of Farage, including from prominent Reform UK supporter Tim Montgomerie, for not distancing himself from Trump's comments sooner.",
      "Farage said he had been on a flight to Washington DC, where he is making a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Farage had \"chosen to explain away Trump's outrageous remarks about President Zelensky instead of doing the right thing and condemning them\".",
      "\"He sounds like a spokesman for Trump,\" Sir Ed said. \"He certainly doesn't speak for Britain.\"",
      "Conservative shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge also criticised Farage, questioning why Ukraine should have a timetable for elections.",
      "\"They're not going through local government reform - they're in an existential war and don't know when it will end,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "\"And does he think Putin should have a timetable for free and fair elections? He actually is a dictator.\"",
      "Farage's comments come after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer backed Zelensky as a \"democratically elected leader\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke to Zelensky on Wednesday evening and told him it was \"perfectly reasonable\" for Ukraine to \"suspend elections during wartime as the UK did during World War Two\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has also defended Zelensky and called on Sir Keir to \"get on a plane to Washington and show some leadership\".",
      "Sir Keir will travel to Washington DC next week for his first in-person meeting with Trump since he became president.",
      "On Thursday, UK Defence Secretary John Healey said Zelensky had \"done what Winston Churchill did during the Second World War, suspended elections while at war\".",
      "The defence secretary, who was in Norway to negotiate a new defence pact aimed at countering the threat from Russia in the Arctic, said it was the UK's job to support Ukraine and \"if they choose to talk, support them in the negotiations as well\".",
      "Starmer backs Zelensky after Trump calls him 'dictator'",
      "Trump echoes Russia as he upends US position on Ukraine",
      "Fact-checking Trump claims about war in Ukraine",
      "President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, after years of fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine's armed forces in the east of the country.",
      "Trump promised to negotiate a quick end to the war if he won the US presidential election last year.",
      "This week, diplomats from the US and Russia met in Saudi Arabia for peace talks, from which Ukraine and European countries were excluded.",
      "But the spat between Trump and Zelensky, which erupted on Tuesday, has threatened to set back progress towards a peace deal.",
      "Trump's barbs came after Zelensky accused the US president of living in a \"bubble\" of Russian disinformation.",
      "In response, the US president said Zelensky had done a \"terrible job\" and suggested Ukraine was responsible for starting the war.",
      "When asked if he agreed with Trump that Ukraine was to blame for Russia's invasion, Farage said it was \"Putin that invaded\" and \"it's him that behaved badly\".",
      "He said Ukraine \"needs to get proper security guarantees\" to ensure there was a \"good and a lasting peace deal\".",
      "Farage has previously faced criticism for his views on the war in Ukraine, including last year, when he suggested the West \"provoked\" Russia's invasion of the country by expanding the European Union and Nato military alliance eastwards.",
      "He later defended those comments in a Telegraph article, insisting he had never been an \"apologist\" for President Putin, but added \"if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised if he responds\"."

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 16:29:37 GMT",
    "summary": "What could happen when Sir Keir Starmer visits the White House next Thursday?",
    "story": [
      "The next seven days really matter.",
      "\"The most negative thing would be a gruesome sell-out of Ukraine and we get slapped with tariffs,\" says a source involved in working out the best moves for No 10 as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to head to the White House to meet President Donald Trump.",
      "\"The better version is Trump returns to a bit more robust behaviour with the Russians, Britain gets patted on the back for making a move on defence spending and we avoid all the tariffs \u2013 a Trumpportunity.\"",
      "With Whitehall-style understatement, a different official predicts the PM \"has a really big decision to make about what to say to Trump in private\" \u2013 remember, just this week the president accused Sir Keir of \"doing nothing\" to try and stop the Ukraine conflict.",
      "So what options does Sir Keir have?",
      "A decision on defence spending is the big focus. The drumbeat of demands for the UK to boost spending was getting louder even before Trump moved into the White House.",
      "The government hasn't yet committed to when it will hit its target of spending 2.5% of the size of the economy, let alone if it will go a lot further as military leaders, Nato, Trump, and now even the Liberal Democrats are calling for.",
      "A senior government source says the PM is \"pushing the system\" to get to a stronger position on spending, but in recent days it's suggested the Treasury's still asking about the spending consequences. The dilemma is obvious: public money is tight as a drum, and Downing Street doesn't want to take cash from the NHS or other priorities at home.",
      "But a Treasury source acknowledged \"the world is changing\", and sources describe a \"phenomenal\" opportunity to take the European lead and please Trump with cash promises.",
      "A Trump backer warns against anything lukewarm: \"a proper commitment, not just a road map, or a path \u2013 be more specific, say 'Yes we'll hit it by this date,' and throw in some more\".",
      "\"He's going to have to do 3% [or more],\" one Whitehall insider suggests, \"so the choice is, does it do it now, for the right reasons, make a virtue of it, or does he end up getting browbeaten into it by Trump?\"",
      "I'm told that there is no final decision on what to say \u2013 and crucial meetings are planned between ministers, officials and military advisers at the start of next week to decide.",
      "What next for Ukraine?",
      "Ukraine is, clearly, central to the talks, and the question looms over what happens if Trump gets the ceasefire he wants.",
      "In the last week UK and French military planners have been working on options, all of which are at an early stage. One idea is  that a \"reassurance\" force of perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 UK and French troops could be deployed after a ceasefire around Ukrainian infrastructure, ports, nuclear power stations, even in some of the key cities.",
      "The model of a joint UK-French force already exists \u2013 the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, a deal signed by the two countries several years ago. Another source suggests the best option for a monitoring force would be under the badge of the UN, if the Russians could be persuaded to accept that, with Ukraine's allies stepping up training and support for Ukraine inside the country.",
      "These options in broad terms, given a public airing by Sir Keir Starmer this week, aren't new, one adviser says, and have been suggested in private for a long time. Another source in government says the plan for 30,000 troops is \"not yet an actual thing\" \u2013 there's no detailed blueprint.",
      "But European leaders know they have to prove to Trump they are serious about contributing to a lasting peace, rather than leaving it to the United States.",
      "I'm told when French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump and Zelensky met in the margins of the fanciest international get together of recent times, the reopening of Notre Dame, Trump said that he'd get Russia to the table, Zelensky said that he would go to the negotiating table, and Macron promised he'd make sure Europe played a real part.",
      "It's worth noting that Trump said \"that's great, I'm all for that\", when asked earlier this week about the idea of European troops being deployed was mentioned.",
      "'We know who the goodies are'",
      "But as the talks approach, uncertainty about the US' true view is the fundamental, and some in government are nervous. Does Trump really believe that Zelensky is a \"dictator\" \u2013 or, as Trump's Ukraine envoy suggested yesterday, a \"courageous leader\"? Does Trump want the \"sugar rush\" of a quick deal that might favour Russia asks one former defence minister, more than achieving something long-term?",
      "A Trump backer said it is \"obscene\" to suggest that the president is a Putin sympathiser, pointing to his previous decisions to approve the sale of Javelin missiles to Ukraine.",
      "In No 10, \"we don't think there is a cut and run\", a senior source says. In private, US figures have reassured the UK that the United States is not about to turn its back on Ukraine.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "In Brussels last week the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth made headlines when he signalled the US would reduce its support for Ukraine \u2013  but a source in the room during the private talks after his controversial public remarks told me Hegseth said \"we know who the goodies are and who the baddies are\".",
      "There is though anxiety in government that Trump might be tempted to just force a deal to end the conflict, then Russia could \"just reload then go again\", according to another source.",
      "But there is a shaky faith \u2013 perhaps more accurately a fervent hope \u2013 that whatever the president's public remarks, that the US will try to involve Ukraine in the talks and does think the peace has to be a deal that lasts, with a force that looks credible, potentially with some form of American support.",
      "Emmanuel Macron, and then Sir Keir, will try to persuade Trump that a deal with security guarantees for Ukraine is the only true victory for the White House.",
      "Remember why all this matters so much back home. What Trump decides to do about the conflict has an effect not just on the security of our continent but our prosperity too: the Ukraine war has shaken our economy through the effect it's had on energy bills.",
      "There is also, of course, the simple and awful human cost of lives lost \u2013 Ukrainians and Russians \u2013 hundreds of thousands of casualties, with terrible suffering on the edge of Europe. Thousands of families in the UK opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees at the start of the war.",
      "The former defence minister notes: \"Sometimes when there is all this noise, we have to still find a way to keep supporting them. Who knows when it is going to end, the only thing we know is they are still being attacked.\"",
      "As the war's three-year anniversary approaches you can expect to hear this message from government too.",
      "And of course what happens matters enormously to the fortunes of this government. Sir Keir might have a huge majority, but he has battled to retain political momentum and his popularity has plunged since taking office.",
      "He may even want to bring other things to the famous Resolute desk beyond defence and Ukraine: Trump is, a senior government source says, notoriously unpredictable and may swerve off topic.",
      "A source familiar with Trump's thinking suggests the PM could turn Trump's freewheeling style to his advantage by putting other issues on the table \u2013 an offer to buy more American Liquid Natural Gas perhaps, revising the deal on the Chagos Islands, a tougher position on China, or a discussion about tech regulation perhaps, with Apple in a huff with the UK government.",
      "Starmer might not have chosen \u2013 few prime ministers do \u2013 to have to confront complicated foreign policy tangles early in office. But one Whitehall observer notes \"kudos to No 10 for handling Trump\" so far, not reacting to his every outburst.",
      "And Brexit, ironically, helps Sir Keir the Remainer carve out a separate role to the rest of Europe.",
      "Working with Trump might be like handling a live firework. But the international jeopardy does present opportunities for the PM, as one former senior official suggests.",
      "If \"you don't have much of a compelling agenda, your social policy is looking hard, your economic policy is looking hard, you can see why he might think,  do you know, the air miles are starting to look pretty attractive\".",

      "Politically it will feel like the right thing to do given President Trump's previous threat to remove Palestinians from Gaza and attack on Ukraine this week.",
      "At the start of the month, Trump put forward a drastic shift in American policy towards the Middle East saying the US will take over the Gaza Strip and turn it into the Riviera of the region.",
      "A wave of international criticism met the comments - including from France, Germany and the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who has warned the US against ethnic cleansing in Gaza.",
      "Earlier this week, he accused Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky of being a \"dictator\" who \"started the war \"with Russia.",
      "For many it was a step too far, even for those within the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) who had fully supported the new Trump administration.",
      "But governments had to walk a thin line by criticising Trump's remarks while not damaging relations with the US.",

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:33:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Since a potentially hazardous asteroid was detected in December, tens of others objects have come close to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "A large asteroid known as 2024 YR4 has grabbed headlines this week as scientists first raised its chances of hitting earth, then lowered them.",
      "The latest estimate says the object has a 0.28% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, significantly lower than the 3.1% chance earlier in the week.",
      "Scientists say it is now more likely to smash into the Moon, with Nasa estimating the probability of that happening at 1%.",
      "But in the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile two months ago, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon, which in astronomical terms sounds like a near miss.",
      "It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.",
      "This is the story of the asteroids that you never hear about \u2013 the fly-bys, the near-misses and the direct hits.",
      "The vast majority are harmless. But some carry the most valuable clues for unlocking mysteries in our universe, information we are desperate to get our hands on.",
      "Asteroids, also sometimes called minor planets, are rocky pieces left over from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.",
      "Rocks routinely orbit close to Earth, pushed by the gravity of other planets.",
      "For most of human history, it has been impossible to know how close we have come to being struck by a large asteroid.",
      "Serious monitoring of objects near Earth only started in the late 20th century, explains Professor Mark Boslough from the University of New Mexico. \"Before that we were blissfully oblivious to them,\" he says.",
      "We now know that quite large objects - 40m across or more - pass between Earth and the Moon several times a year. That's the same size of asteroid that exploded over Siberia in 1908 injuring people and damaging buildings over 200 square miles.",
      "The most serious near-miss, and the closest comparison with YR4, was an asteroid called Apophis which was first spotted in 2004 and measured 375 meters across, or around the size of a cruise ship.",
      "Professor Patrick Michel from French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) tracked Apophis and recalls it was considered the most hazardous asteroid ever detected.",
      "It took until 2013 to get enough observations to understand that it was not going to hit Earth.",
      "But he says there was one big difference with YR4. \"We didn't know what to do. We discovered something, we determined an impact probability, and then thought, who do we call?\" he says. Scientists and governments had no idea how to respond, he says.",
      "A large asteroid strike could be catastrophic if it hits an area where humans live.",
      "We don't know exactly how big YR4 is yet, but if it is at the top end of estimates, about 90m across, it would likely remain substantially intact rather than break up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "\"The surviving asteroid mass could create a crater. Structures in the immediate vicinity would likely be destroyed and people within the local region (dozens of kilometers) would be at risk of serious injury,\" explains Professor Kathryn Kunamoto from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Some people could die.",
      "But since Apophis, there have been huge advances in what is called planetary defence.",
      "Prof Michel is part of the international Space Mission Planning Advisory Group.",
      "Its delegates advise governments on how to respond to an asteroid threat and run rehearsal exercise for direct hits. There is one going on right now.",
      "If the asteroid was on course for a town or city, Dr Boslough compares the response to preparations made for a major hurricane, including evacuations and measures to protect infrastructure.",
      "The Space Mission Planning Advisory Group will meet again in April to decide what to do about YR4.",
      "By then most scientists expect the risk to have almost entirely gone, as their calculations of its trajectory become more precise.",
      "We do have options beyond \"taking a hit\", as Dr Kumamoto puts it.",
      "Nasa and the European Space Agency have developed technologies to nudge dangerous asteroids off course.",
      "Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully slammed a spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos to change its path.",
      "However scientists are sceptical if that would work in the case of YR4 due to uncertainty about what it is made of and the short window of time to successfully deflect it.",
      "And what about the asteroids that do hit Earth? An awkward truth for scientists is that a direct strike on land far from humans is the ideal scenario for asteroids.",
      "That gives them actual pieces from distant objects within of our solar system, as well as insights into Earth's impact history.",
      "Nearly 50,000 asteroids have been found in Antarctica. The most famous, called ALH 84001, is believed to have originated on Mars and contains minerals with vital evidence about the planet's history, suggesting it was warm and had water on its surface billions of years ago.",
      "In 2023 scientists detected an asteroid called 33 Polyhymnia which could have an element denser than anything found on Earth.",
      "This superheavy element would be something entirely new to our planet. 33 Polyhymnia is at least 170 million kilometers away, but it's an indication of the incredible potential of asteroids for our understanding of science.",
      "Now that the chances are higher that YR4 will hit the Moon, some scientists are getting excited about that.",
      "An impact could give real-world answers to questions they have only been able to simulate using computers.",
      "\"To have even one data point of a real example would be incredibly powerful,\" says Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London.",
      "\"How much material comes out when the asteroid hits? How fast does it go? How far does that travel?\" he asks.",
      "It would help them test the scenarios they have modelled about asteroid impacts on Earth, helping create better predictions.",
      "YR4 has reminded us that we live on a planet vulnerable to collisions with something the solar system is full of \u2013 rocks.",
      "Scientists warn against complacency, saying it is a matter of when, not if, a large asteroid will threaten human life on Earth, although most expect that to be in the coming centuries rather than decades.",
      "In the meantime, our ability to monitor space keeps improving. Later this year the largest digital camera ever built will begin working at the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, able to capture the night sky in incredible detail.",

      "Its construction is predicted to require a workforce of 7,900 people, with about two thirds moving from outside the area, and some people in nearby Leiston have claimed \"landlords are cashing in\" by raising rents.",
      "Linda Druce, director and founder of Druce Estate & Letting Agents, said: \"I have been in the area for 21 years now and this is the first time we have seen such a significant jump, particularly in rental prices.\"",
      "Leiston, located between the more affluent coastal towns of Aldeburgh and Southwold, had traditionally been viewed as a more affordable place to live.",

      "\"It is mainly because of Sizewell C contractors and those looking to be working here over the next year or two who are looking to rent,\" she said.",

      "\"But that doesn't factor in the number of landlords we have who do not want to increase their rent and are actually really good.",
      "\"The problem is a lot of landlords see pound signs and then the floodgates open and so, at the moment, if I put a house up for sale in Leiston, nine times out of 10 the viewing will be with someone who wants to buy it and rent it out per room.\"",
      "Elsewhere in the town, another three-bedroom home is being advertised at a cost of \u00a33,100 a month including bills, while a two-bedroom apartment is being let at a rate of \u00a33,045 a month, including utility bills.",
      "The current cost of renting in the area has raised eyebrows, not least given the average rent in Leiston is \u00a3773, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Sizewell C said 2,400 of the workers at the new power station will be based on site, while 500 others will live at Pontins Pakefield, near Lowestoft.",
      "The remaining contractors, however, will have to move into local properties.",
      "Alison Downes, from the campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: \"If Sizewell C goes ahead thousands more workers from outside the area will need accommodation and if those numbers increase, like at Hinkley Point C, where they are going up to a staggering 15,000, the people of Leiston will face many years more pain.\"",
      "It is not just landlords who could capitalise on the influx of workers heading into the area.",
      "Residents in Leiston who have spare rooms or spaces can apply to East Suffolk Council for a Sizewell C Housing Grant, which range from \u00a33,000 to \u00a37,000, as the authority looks to provide an additional 1,200 bed spaces during the construction.",

    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",

The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",
      "Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:",
      "17,000 sq m of mesh could produce enough water to meet the weekly water demand  of 300,000 litres that is currently delivered by truck to urban slums110 sq m could meet the annual demand for the irrigation of the city's green spacesFog water could be used for soil-free (hydroponic) agriculture, with yields of 33 to 44lb (15 to 20kg) of green vegetables in a month",

      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",

    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",

      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:45:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Two sinkholes have appeared in the Surrey village of Godstone, but how have they formed and are they dangerous?",
    "story": [
      "Residents in the Surrey village of Godstone have been evacuated after two sinkholes opened up this week along large parts of the high street.",
      "The original hole first appeared late on Monday night, growing to at least 65ft (20m) long by Tuesday lunchtime.",
      "Sinkholes are not uncommon in the UK but can sometimes appear suddenly. What might be the causes and should we be more worried about them?",
      "What is a sinkhole?",
      "A sinkhole is a depression in the surface because the underlying rock has collapsed.",
      "They can be saucer-shaped or appear deeper more like shafts. If they occur in built-up areas they can appear more irregular as a road or another structure above can distort the shape.",
      "In Godstone, the collapsed ground is under a road which is partially concealing the size of the depression.",
      "How are they formed?",
      "Sinkholes can appear for many different reasons - it is often due to the geology but human factors can also be a cause.",
      "One of the most common reasons for a sinkhole is when rocks like limestone or chalk break down. This happens because carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid - this then percolates through the rock and reacts with it, causing it to dissolve.",
      "Sometimes this process can happen gradually, where the depression becomes larger over time.",
      "In other instances, the limestone sits below another layer of rock, which means that as it gets dissolved there are no immediate signs at the surface.",
      "The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - called a 'collapse sinkhole'.",
      "These are most common in South Wales where sandstone rocks lie above caves in the limestone.",
      "But human activities can also accelerate the formation of sinkholes or cause the ground to collapse in a similar way.",
      "Dr Andrew Farrant, British Geological Survey regional geologist for south-east England, suspects that is what has happened in Godstone and it is not a true sinkhole.",
      "He said that one theory is that a burst water main has caused a sudden influx of water into the sandstone bed and has \"flushed\" weak sand out the way.",
      "Pete Burgess, of the Wealden Cave and Mines Society, said a quarry marked \"sand pit\" can be seen on 19th century maps of land directly under the sinkhole.",
      "He added that sand from the pit was dug out and used for building and gardening purposes.",
      "Dr Farrant said that sand pit had been filled in but he added unrecorded underground sand mines may be present in the area, and it is possible that a leaking pipe may have triggered the collapse of these underground mines and allowed sediment to be flushed out from beneath the road.",
      "How common are sinkholes in the UK?",
      "They are common in the UK because of the abundance of limestone and chalk rock and historic mining activities.",
      "Limestone and chalk are formed from the deposit and compression of micro-organisms found in shallow warm seas. Millions of years ago the UK was located further south towards the equator and was much warmer with parts of the country submerged - creating the ideal conditions for these rock types to form.",
      "Dr Vanessa Banks, expert in shallow geohazards and risks at the British Geological Survey, told the BBC's Radio 4 PM programme: \"Sinkholes occur in spates but many are not recorded as they occur in remote areas.\"",
      "She added that meteorological conditions play a role as extreme downpours can flush water through the rocks or put pressure on infrastructure like water mains.",
      "Last December, about 30 homes were evacuated in Merthyr Tydfil after the ground collapsed, and in 2014 sinkholes occurred at five to ten times the normal rate across south-east England after intense storm conditions.",
      "Are they dangerous?",
      "\"Collapse sinkholes\" which can appear suddenly and without any warnings at the surface, like cracks or subsidence, can be dangerous.",
      "In 2010, a sinkhole measuring 20m in diameter and 90m deep, appeared in Guatemala City which resulted in the death of one person. In this case heavy rains and poor drainage are thought to have weakened the underlying rock.",
      "And in January a truck cabin was swallowed by a sinkhole in the Japanese city of Yashio, apparently as the result of a sewer rupture. The truck's 74-year-old driver was reported missing.",
      "In the case of dissolution sinkholes geologists can indicate which areas are more at risk if the underlying rock is made up of chalk or limestone. For any new development in the UK the local planning authority does review the geology and any potential risks.",
      "But Dr Collins, reader in geology and geotechnical engineering at Brunel University, said that in this case where water infrastructure plays a role it is harder to predict potential ground collapses.",
      "\"The pipe rupture does highlight the challenge that comes with having buried infrastructure as they are often buried at depths in excess of a metre. The depth is to reduce the impact of deep freeze during a very cold winter.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this makes them hard to monitor and repairs can be difficult, including the replacement of soil in the excavated hole once the repair is complete,\" he said.",

      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

    "story": [
      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

    "story": [
      "More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.",
      "It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.",
      "The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.",
      "The regulator accused the apps of \"a lack of robust interventions\" for checking the ages of their users.",
      "The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube.",
      "Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.",
      "For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children.",
      "In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason.",
      "It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force.",
      "\"The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps,\" said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant.",
      "Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users.",
      "In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram -  took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. \"This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,\" said a TikTok spokesperson.",
      "\"Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision.\"",
      "A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies.",
      "'84% use social media'",
      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",
      "They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.",
      "Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.",
      "The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.",
      "If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year.",
      "'Inconsistency'",
      "\"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,\" the report's authors said.",
      "\"However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account.\"",
      "The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users.",
      "Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service.",
      "\"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,\" the report said.",
      "\"This may require time and engagement to detect a child under 13, and in that time the child may be exposed to risks and harms.\""

      "A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to \u20ac35,000 ($36,000; \u00a329,000).",
      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",
      "\"Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.",
      "Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.",
      "The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.",
      "Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".",
      "Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.",
      "In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.",
      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",
      "\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".",
      "Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.",
      "According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.",
      "\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.",
      "Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"",
      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",
      "\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"",
      "Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.",
      "Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.",
      "\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"",
      "Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.",
      "\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"",
      "Mr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

    "title": "Will quantum computers disrupt critical infrastructure?",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:40:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",
      "\"With cryptography,\" says Mr Dupressoir \"If somebody breaks your system, you will only know once they've got your data.\"",

      "Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has doubled its support in just four years to 20.8%, and has spread out from its support base in the east to become the second biggest political force in parliament.",
      "Meanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD had its worst performance in decades, only securing 16.4% of the vote.",
      "Here are five key takeaways.",
      "AfD dominant in east, spreading to the west",
      "Look at an election results map of Germany, and you could almost have travelled back in time to the Cold War, when an iron curtain divided communist East Germany from the west.",
      "In the east it's a swathe of AfD light blue, apart from pockets like Berlin and half of Leipzig. In the west the vast majority has turned conservative black, especially in Bavaria where Merz's conservative sister party, the CSU, dominates the landscape.",
      "But the AfD is spreading in the west too, and political loyalty to the old mainstream parties has gone.",
      "For one in five Germans it has become normalised. \"They're just normal people,\" said one young man of immigrant origin in Duisburg, a city in western Germany's old industrial heartland.",
      "Even though it came second, the AfD is blocked from being part of the next government because of a \"firewall\" - or Brandmauer - operated by Germany's main parties, who do not co-operate with any party seen as extremist since the end of World War Two.",
      "The AfD's leader Alice Weidel insists it is a libertarian, conservative movement, not racist. Its big increase in public support has coincided with a series of deadly attacks in the past nine months, all allegedly by immigrants.",
      "The AfD has embraced a highly controversial policy called \"remigration\", which it defines as deporting migrants who have committed crimes. But the term can also refer to the mass deportation of migrants and their descendants.",
      "In May 2024 a German court rejected an AfD appeal against a ruling classifying it as a suspected far-right extremist organisation. Judges found that the AfD had \"positions that disparage the democratic order and are incompatible with the principle of democracy\".",
      "In three German states in the east - Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony - domestic intelligence has designated the AfD as right-wing extremist.",
      "A leading AfD figure in Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has twice been convicted of using a banned Nazi slogan \"Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland\" - everything for Germany. Alice Weidel supporters have chanted her name during the election campaign, using the phrase \"Alice f\u00fcr Deutschland\".",
      "Germans voted in biggest turnout for 40 years",
      "Not since 1987 has turnout been as high as 82.5% in a German election, and that was three years before reunification of east and west.",
      "Four years ago it was 76.6%.",
      "Put simply, more than four in every five of Germany's 59.2 million voters turned out.",
      "It reflects just how energised Germans have been by this election, which comes at a pivotal moment for their country. There were nine TV debates in the final stretch of the campaign, but that reflected the broad interest of the audience.",
      "All over for leaders of collapsed government",
      "The three-party government of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz fell apart at the end of last year, and within 24 hours of Sunday's election, all three leaders have said they're leaving the front line of politics.",
      "The leader of the economic liberals, the FDP, was first. Christian Lindner has led his party for 11 years. But it failed to get any MPs elected and Lindner has said he's leaving politics after 25 years.",
      "It was Lindner's refusal to compromise on debt rules that first brought the government down, and then sent his party into the wilderness.",
      "Although Scholz will remain as chancellor until the next government is formed, he won't be taking part in coalition talks and will be leaving frontline politics.",
      "Greens Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck is also leaving frontline politics after his party fell below 12% in the election.",
      "TikTok generation hauls Left back from dead",
      "Until a few weeks ago, the Left party looked doomed when one of its leading lights, Sahra Wagenknecht, went off and founded her own, more populist, party with eight other MPs.",
      "Wagenknecht's popularity soared for a while as head of her BSW party, but ultimately fell just below the 5% threshold for getting into parliament.",
      "The story was very different for the Left (Die Linke), which came back from the dead with an inspired social medial campaign.",
      "Heidi Reichinnek, Die Linke's co-chair, went viral after she gave a speech enthusiastically defending the firewall against the AfD.",
      "She now has 580,000 followers on TikTok and her post has attracted seven million views.",
      "Her party secured just under 9% of the vote.",

      "Die Linke's viral videos helped secure a quarter of the 18-24 vote, and the AfD were not far behind with 21%, according to surveys by ARD TV.",
      "Alice Weidel was the biggest hit on social media during the election, even bigger than Heidi Reichinnek. She has attracted more than 935,000 followers on TikTok.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 00:16:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Nearly two million people who have relied on community kitchens for food have lost this lifeline.",
    "story": [
      "The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned.",
      "Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut.",
      "It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected.",
      "The conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023.",
      "The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods.",
      "\"People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\"",
      "The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID.",
      "The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice.",
      "The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance \u2013 on which the communal kitchens depend \u2013 will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes.",
      "The closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations.",
      "The network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID.",
      "It's a \"huge setback\" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who's set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms.",

      "What is USAID and why is Trump poised to 'close it down'?",
      "'My wife fears sex, I fear death' - impacts of the USAID freeze",
      "The former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN.",
      "Money had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works.",
      "\"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets (humanitarian group) in Syria.\"",
      "For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out.",
      "There was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege.",
      "Most of the kitchens have closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon \"we expect to see a lot of people starving\".",
      "Here and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID.",
      "\"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],\" she said, \"but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was.\"",
      "\"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,\" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation.",
      "They are \"exhausted, traumatised and underfunded\" and \"we were scaling up to help them\".",
      "The State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful.",
      "\"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\" it said in response to a BBC query.",
      "The World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances.",
      "In 2024 the United States was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan.",
      "Top UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries.",
      "\"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,\" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month.",
      "The influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further.",
      "\"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,\" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director.",
      "He had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. \"We are strained. It's extremely difficult.\"",

      "Last surgeons standing in Darfur city's only hospital",
      "They both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, \"it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger\", says Ms Dagesh.",
      "Most families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority.",
      "\"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,\" she said.",
      "Most of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people.",
      "They say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing.",
      "Faced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape.",
      "Many of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods.",
      "They would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight.",
      "With the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders.",
      "Yet aid agencies that normally would help are strained.",
      "The UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise \"to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum\".",
      "It does not help that the agency was already underfunded.",
      "The UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut \"everything\", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive.",
      "The US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo.",
      "\"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,\" Mr Balde told the BBC.",
      "Faced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on \"very dangerous journeys\", says Mr Balde.",

    "story": [
      "A 22-member Bangladeshi delegation of political leaders, civil society activists, academics and journalists have begun a 10-day visit to China.",
      "They will be having talks with Chinese government officials and senior members of the ruling Communist Party, a delegation leader confirmed with the BBC.",
      "Analysts say China is making overtures while diplomatic tensions have risen between Bangladesh and India on a range of issues.",
      "This includes ousted Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina living in exile in India. Dhaka has requested her extradition but Delhi has refused.",
      "Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior official from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) who's leading the delegation in Beijing, told the BBC: \"It's basically a goodwill visit, initiated by Beijing.\"",
      "\"It is unique because China this time has invited a team representing various groups in Bangladesh.\"",
      "Many of the delegation members are from the BNP and its allies. The BNP, headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, is one of the main parties in Bangladesh, besides the Awami League led by Hasina.",
      "The delegation also includes several representatives from the student movement that began the mass uprising against Hasina that eventually ousted the prime minister in August last year.",
      "An interim government, led by the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is currently in charge.",
      "It has been urging India to repatriate Hasina to face charges of crimes against humanity and money laundering, among other allegations. The UN says Hasina's government's crackdown on protesters during the uprising killed about 1,400 people.",
      "So far India has showed no sign of extraditing Hasina, who denies the charges.",

      "Bangladesh leader\u2019s \u2018megaphone diplomacy\u2019 irks India",
      "Delhi and Dhaka had maintained close ties during the 15-year rule of Ms Hasina, who was widely seen by her critics as pro-India. While maintaining close ties with Delhi, she balanced it with her relationship with Beijing.",
      "After the fall of Hasina, Beijing has stepped up its interaction with Bangladeshi leaders, activists and delegations, including from Islamist parties.",
      "This week's visit follows a meeting between the Bangladesh interim government's foreign policy advisor Touhid Hossain and the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing in January.",
      "It also marks the second time BNP officials have visited China in recent months, after Beijing hosted a BNP delegation late last year.",
      "With the political vacuum and absence of India's influence, analysts say, Beijing is trying to increase its foothold in Bangladesh, a country of about 170 million people.",
      "China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner with bilateral trade amounting to around $24bn (\u00a319bn) - the vast majority of that consists of Chinese exports to the South Asian country.",
      "The Bangladeshi military also heavily relies on Chinese equipment and ammunition with more than 70% of supplies coming from China.",
      "Compared to Beijing's overtures, India has had very limited interactions with the interim government and other Bangladeshi political leaders in the past six months.",
      "The BNP held a protest in December alleging India's interference in Bangladesh's internal matters by hosting Hasina. Some advisors of the interim government have also criticised Delhi on the same issue.",
      "This criticism has sparked sharp reaction from Delhi.",
      "The Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said last week that it was up to Bangladesh to decide on \"what kind of relationship they want with us\".",
      "He described the criticism of India by Bangladeshi officials and politicians as \"absolutely ridiculous\".",

      "\"I don't believe India should consider the whole subcontinent is under Delhi's sphere of influence. That attitude would make India suffer,\" Chinese analyst Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Beijing's Tsinghua University, told the BBC."

      "On Sunday, the Pope's condition was said to be critical with respiratory and kidney problems.",
      "But the Vatican has now said that a \"slight\" kidney problem was not a cause for concern, more than a week after he was admitted to hospital.",
      "\"Even today there were no episodes of asthmatic respiratory attacks; some laboratory tests have improved,\" said the Vatican in an evening bulletin on the 88-year-old's health.",
      "The pontiff resumed some work on Monday and called the Priest of the Parish of Gaza \"to express his fatherly closeness\", the Vatican added.",
      "The Pope is having oxygen therapy but doctors \"are prudently not yet disclosing the prognosis\", a statement said.",
      "This is certainly the most positive statement on the Pope's health in a couple of days, but his condition is still described as critical. His doctors are not ready to give any kind of prognosis.",
      "That said, Vatican sources this evening said that Francis has been eating \"normally\" and \"can move\". He is not bedridden. He has no fever, and no apparent sign of sepsis. On Friday his doctors described such a development as the greatest risk, in his situation.",
      "The work the Pope was said to be doing on Monday afternoon was \"light\"- reading and signing documents.",
      "He has been calling a Catholic parish in Gaza most evenings throughout the war there. It's thought this is the first call he has been able to make in recent days, although did keep up the practice when he was first hospitalised.",
      "On Saturday, the Vatican said that the Pope had experienced a respiratory crisis and was in a \"critical\" condition, but later on Sunday released an update that he had \"not presented any further respiratory crises\".",

    "story": [
      "A French former surgeon accused of abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children, has told a court that he admits to having \"committed despicable acts\" and \"understands and shares the suffering\" caused to his alleged victims.",
      "Joel Le Scouarnec is accused of assaulting or raping 299 patients, the vast majority under 15 years old, between 1989 and 2014, mostly in Brittany.",
      "\"I am perfectly aware that these wounds are indelible, beyond repair,\" Le Scouarnec said, in a halting but clear voice.",
      "The white-haired 74-year-old, who wore glasses and a black zip-up sweater over a grey shirt, was addressing the court in Vannes, north-west France, on the first day of the largest child abuse trial in French history.",
      "Warning: This story contains distressing details",
      "\"I can't go back, but I owe it to [the victims] and their relatives to admit my actions and the consequences they had and that they undoubtedly will continue to have throughout their lives,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.",
      "Throughout the day - which was mainly devoted to technical proceedings - he had looked attentive but had no particular reaction when two visibly nervous men in their 30s took the stand to identify themselves as his victims.",
      "The youngest of Le Scouarnec's alleged victims was aged one and the oldest 70.",
      "Police were able to identify them thanks to meticulously-compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec is alleged to have logged assaults he carried out on his young patients over more than 25 years.",
      "He has already been imprisoned since 2017 for abusing four children, of which he was found guilty in 2020.",
      "Many of the plaintiffs were allegedly abused while they were under anaesthesia or recovering from surgeries in hospitals across northern France - meaning a number of them had no recollection of the abuse they are said to have sustained, and had to be told by police that their names appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries.",
      "\"Everything in this terrible story is out of the ordinary... it wasn't the victims that approached the investigators but the investigators that alerted the victims,\" public prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger said in court.",
      "\"Many of them had no memory... several would have rather gone on not knowing. But silence had reigned for too long.\"",
      "Many other people, who do remember being allegedly abused, have said the impact of the events has followed them their whole lives, in many cases resulting in serious psychological trauma.",
      "Mauricette Vinet, the grandmother of a patient of Le Scouarnec who killed himself some years ago, told the BBC her grandson Mathis had been \"killed\" by Le Scouarnec's alleged abuse.",
      "\"If he hadn't happened Mathis would still be here,\" she said.",
      "Defence lawyer Maxime Tissier told the trial on Monday that Le Scouarnec admitted to the \"vast majority\" of the charges against him and that his client would soon \"explain himself\" with regard to the accusations.",
      "\"He is a defendant who has made himself entirely available to the court... despite his age,\" Mr Tissier said.",
      "Le Scouarmec added in court that during his police examinations he did his best to \"admit to the events which constituted rape and those that, in my view, did not\".",
      "Dozens of lawyers were also present in court, but the hundreds of alleged victims they represent were sat in a separate overflow room due to their sheer number. Several psychologists and emotional support dogs will be on hand throughout the course of the trial.",
      "Aude Buresi, the presiding judge, read out a graphic and gruelling summary of the charges against Le Scouarnec, as well as excerpts from his interrogations in 2020, in which the former surgeon initially denied that his diaries reflected real-life abuse and were merely retellings of his \"fantasies\".",
      "But Ms Buresi said several elements - including the level of detail and choice of words used by Le Scouarnec - indicated that the diaries were most likely truthful.",
      "In his short statement to the court on Monday, the former surgeon referred to his writings as \"very violent\".",
      "An hour before proceedings kicked off a few dozen protesters staged a rally outside the courtroom, carrying letters spelling out the phrase \"Stop the code of silence\", while another sign read \"Who knew?\"",
      "Victims and child advocacy groups have said \"systemic failures\" allowed Le Scouarnec to continue working with children.",
      "In 2005, the FBI warned the French authorities that he had been accessing child abuse websites, but this just resulted in a suspended sentence and he faced no consequences in the workplace.",
      "Later, when Le Scouarnec was working in the hospital of Quimperl\u00e9, he allegedly made sexually-charged comments about a young patient of his, raising the suspicions of a colleague who alerted the regional medical association and made them aware of the suspended sentence.",
      "The members of the association were summoned and all but one doctor - who abstained - voted that Le Scouarnec had not violated the medical code of ethics. The BBC has approached the regional medical association for comment",
      "The association is now pressing charges against Le Scouarnec for \"bringing the medical profession into disrepute,\" the body's secretary Didier Robin said on Monday.",
      "His statement elicited a swift rebuttal from lawyer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Benoist, who represents a child protection advocacy group La Voix de L'Enfant (The Child's Voice) and has previously told the BBC that Le Scouarnec was able to commit his deeds due to \"a huge degree of dysfunction\" among medical professionals.",
      "Mr Benoist said it was \"morally indecent and legally questionable\" that the medical association was allowed to be listed as a plaintiff. \"It is unacceptable that [the association] is sat alongside the victims,\" he said.",
      "Monday's session closed early - something that is unlikely to happen again over the course of the trial, which will run on a tight schedule and is due to end in June.",
      "At the request of the plaintiffs, some sessions will be held behind closed doors - but big portions of it will be open to journalists and members of the public.",
      "Le Scouarnec's ex-wife and his siblings will be heard in court on Tuesday.",
      "Asked why she was attending proceedings that will undoubtedly include sordid and graphic details of abuse, one woman queuing to enter the overflow room told the BBC she wanted to see \"this doctor, this Mr Everyman\".",

      "Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails.",
      "They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers.",
      "In the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed \"in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes\".",
      "\"It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies.\"",
      "Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a \"blatant violation\" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released.",
      "\"We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,\" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday.",
      "Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that \"all options are on the table\".",
      "\"Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],\" he added.",
      "\"Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?\"",
      "Naim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released.",
      "The White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an \"appropriate response\" to what it called the \"barbaric treatment\" of hostages by Hamas.",
      "But President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting \"an extension of phase one\".",
      "\"We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,\" he told CNN on Sunday.",
      "A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase.",
      "So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal.",
      "The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day.",
      "The ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "At least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter."

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 00:25:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Pakistan\u2019s heavy loss to India on Sunday rekindles the debate - has this rivalry become overhyped?",
    "story": [
      "Roaring crowds, faces painted blue and green, flags waving like battle standards.",
      "This is the opening of The Greatest Rivalry: India v Pakistan, a new Netflix documentary on one of cricket's most storied contests.",
      "India's Virender Sehwag sets the tone: \"This is a contest bigger than one between the bat and ball\". Cut to dramatic footage of some of the matches, the Wagah border, partition refugees. A nation split into two, but forever bound by cricket.",
      "Pakistan's Waqar Younis doesn't hesitate: \"I put this rivalry right at the top. There's no match like India v Pakistan.\" India's R Ashwin agrees: \"I think this is bigger than the Ashes.\" Ramiz Raja says it's \"the political garnish that makes this rivalry world-class\".",
      "Despite wars, border standoffs and terror attacks, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry has endured, driven by history and national pride. Even when politics halts the bilateral series, International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments keep the fire alive, turning every match into a high-stakes spectacle.",
      "But Pakistan's crushing defeat to India on Sunday at the Champions Trophy has reignited the question: is this rivalry overhyped, propped up by slogans like \"war minus the shooting\" - a phrase George Orwell coined in 1945 to criticise excessive  nationalism in sports?",
      "Is this still the premier clash in cricket, or just one of its most dramatic? Has it lost its competitive edge, running more on history than intensity?",
      "Consider this. From an eight-wicket thrashing in 2018 to a 228-run demolition in 2023, India has dominated, winning six of the last eight ODIs. Pakistan's last victory? The 2017 Champions Trophy final - a fading memory in an increasingly one-sided rivalry.",
      "What rivalry, asked Dawn - a leading Pakistani newspaper - pointedly after the latest debacle. A cricket war that's now just a big yawn, headlined India Today magazine.",
      "The loss would be easier to accept if Pakistan were at least putting up a fight, according to Dawn's Zohaib Ahmed Majeed.",
      "Majeed believes the troubled politics between the two neighbours is the only thing that has kept the rivalry alive.",
      "\"In a way we must thank the politicians of these two nations for keeping this rivalry alive, because the cricketers, especially from our side, are certainly incapable of putting up a show that is worthy of its billing,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Cut out the war of words and the actual wars and what you'll be left with is a professional cricketing unit against a haphazardly put together team at the last minute. There is no rivalry as far as pure cricketing merits are concerned.\"",
      "India Today was no less acerbic. \"With its history of one-sided losses to India in recent years, Pakistan cricket is fast sliding into pity territory. And unless it reverses the trend, Pakistan's dream of competing with India could soon turn into a butt of jokes for cricket fans,\" wrote Sandipan Sharma.",
      "To be true, Pakistan's cricketing woes keep mounting. They have missed the final four in the last three ODI World Cups, crashed out in the T20 World Cup group stage and now, as hosts of the Champions Trophy, they've hit rock-bottom.",
      "Since the 2009 attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, Pakistan cricket has battled isolation, political turmoil, board instability, frequent coaching changes and selection controversies - all adding to its struggles. Meanwhile, across the border, India has risen as cricket's powerhouse, backed by a strong domestic system and the IPL, cricket's richest international league.",
      "Pakistani cricket writer Osman Samiuddin also notes a sense of \"marginalisation\" among his country's cricketers, who remain excluded from the IPL and its franchise ecosystem (no Pakistani player has featured in the IPL since 2009, as they were banned after the Mumbai terror attacks). \"I think they see Indian cricketers and others as well, like Australian and English cricketers, as partaking in a world of cricket they have been excluded from,\" he told a programme.",
      "This has all contributed to the team's fast-declining fortunes.",
      "\"It is a futile exercise to wonder if this is the lowest Pakistan cricket has ever been. However, even when Pakistan have plummeted to spectacular lows in the past, they have done it in a way that justifies the clich\u00e9 of their mercurial nature,\" wrote Sidharth Monga in ESPNcricinfo, after Sunday's game.",
      "\"This slide just feels like a terminal, slow decline. Players are not fighting with each other, there is no backdoor intrigue, there are no cliques in the team plotting to dethrone the captain, there are no comical run-outs or misfields, no defeats snatched from the jaws of victory.\"",
      "The \"war without guns\" narrative once held weight, especially when Imran Khan's Pakistan, armed with a fearsome pace attack of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and batting stars like Javed Miandad and Inzamam-ul-Haq, regularly got the better of India.",
      "\"The narrative may have been true till the early 2000s because this is how the actual fans felt. But it was soon hijacked by the multinationals and the media to cash in on the hyper-pathos of it all,\" Nadeem Farooq Paracha, Pakistani author and columnist, told me.",
      "\"The quality of cricket between the two sides isn't the same anymore. Indian cricket continues to get better. In fact, I think the narrative in question here has ended up pressuring Pakistani side more. They underplay it, even though they're more than willing to pocket its financial benefits.\"",
      "The cricket boards and broadcasters are doing all they can to keep the rivalry alive, and the ICC won't dial down the hype - it's too valuable in an era of overexposure of cricket, limited stars and competition from franchise cricket.",
      "This one game has become a financial juggernaut, fuelling a parallel economy wherever it's played - Dubai, London, Ahmedabad - drawing fans who spend big just to be there. \"Pakistan has talent, but the contest now feels more psychological,\" says cricket writer Gautam Bhattacharyya.",
      "Brand consultant Santosh Desai feels the real contest between the arch rivals plays out beyond the cricket ground and the \"rivalry thrives more in imagination than in reality\".",
      "\"The asymmetry [between the two sides] only fuels the hype. India's dominance makes it an easy narrative to sell, a battle royale where the outcome feels preordained. If Pakistan were winning consistently, the marketing appeal would fade. The rivalry's commercial power lies in India's superiority, feeding a script designed for validation, not uncertainty,\" Desai told me.",
      "India's vice-captain Shubman Gill dismisses talk of overhyping, calling it a contest fans love to watch. \"It is an exciting contest when both of these teams play. Everyone enjoys watching it. If so many people are happy to watch the match, then who are we to say that it is underhyped or overhyped,\" he told reporters on eve of Sunday's game.",
      "Gill is possibly right. Tickets for India-Pakistan games still fly off the shelves - the ICC reported sellouts within minutes. An astonishing 600 plus million viewers tuned in to watch Sunday's match on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar, setting new records.",
      "But for now, as cricket writer Ayaz Memon puts it, \"the hype is more thrilling than the cricket itself\"."

    "summary": "Three years on from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the return of Donald Trump has changed everything",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv no longer looks like a city at war in the way that it was three years ago. The shops are open and commuters get delayed in traffic jams on their way to work. But in the days since 12 February this year when US President Donald Trump rang Russia's Vladimir Putin to send a 90-minute political embrace from the White House to the Kremlin, 2022's old nightmares of national extinction have returned. Ukrainians used to get angry about the way that President Joe Biden held back weapons systems and restricted the way Ukraine used the ones that arrived here. Even so, they knew whose side he was on.",
      "Instead, Donald Trump has delivered a stream of exaggeration, half-truths and outright lies about the war that echo the views of President Putin. They include his dismissal of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as a dictator who does not deserve a seat at the table when America and Russia decide the future of his country. The biggest lie Trump has told is that Ukraine started the war.",
      "Trump's negotiating strategy is to offer concessions even before serious talks have started. Instead of putting pressure on the country that broke international law by invading its neighbour, leading to huge destruction and hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded, he has turned on Ukraine.",
      "His public statements have offered Russia important concessions, declaring that Ukraine will not join Nato and accepting that it will keep at least some of the land it seized by force. Vladimir Putin's record shows he respects strength. He regards concessions as a sign of weakness.",
      "He has not budged from a demand for even more Ukrainian land than his men now occupy. Immediately after the first talks, held in Saudi Arabia, between Russia and the US since the 2022 invasion, Putin's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov repeated his demand that no Nato troops would be allowed into Ukraine to provide security guarantees.",
      "A veteran European diplomat who has dealt with the Russians and the Americans told me that when the grizzled, highly experienced Lavrov met Trump's novice Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"he would have eaten him like a soft-boiled egg.\"",
      "Challenging times",
      "A few days ago, as Trump threw more insults at Ukraine's president, I went to the heavily guarded government quarter in Kyiv to meet Ihor Brusylo, who is a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky and deputy head of his office. Brusylo acknowledged how much pressure Trump is putting on them.",
      "\"It's very, very tough. These are very hard, challenging times,\" Brusylo said. \"I wouldn't say that now it's easier than it was in 2022. It's like you live it all over again.\"",
      "Brusylo said Ukrainians, and their president, were as determined to fight to stay independent as they had been in 2022.",
      "\"We're a sovereign country. We are part of Europe, and we will remain so.\"",
      "Fading colours",
      "In the weeks after Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the sound of battle on the edge of Kyiv echoed around streets that were almost empty. Checkpoints and barricades, walls of sandbags and tank traps welded from steel girders were rushed out onto Kyiv's broad boulevards. At the railway station, fifty thousand civilians a day, mostly women and children, were boarding trains going west, away from the Russians.",
      "The platforms were packed and every time a train pulled in, came another surge of panic as people pushed and shoved to get on. In those freezing days, in bitter wind and flurries of snow, it felt as if the colours of the 21st century were fading into an old monochrome newsreel that Europeans had believed until then was safely consigned to the vaults of history.",
      "President Zelensky, in Joe Biden's words, \"didn't want to hear\" American warnings that an invasion was imminent. Putin rattling a Russian sabre was one thing. A full-scale invasion, with tens of thousands of troops and columns of armour, surely belonged in the past.",
      "Putin believed Russia's mighty and modernised army would make quick work of its obstinate, independent neighbour and its recalcitrant president. Ukraine's western allies also thought Russia would win quickly. On television news channels, retired generals talked about smuggling in light weapons to arm an insurgency while the west imposed sanctions and hoped for the best.",
      "As Russian troops massed on Ukraine's borders, Germany delivered 5,000 ballistic combat helmets instead of offensive weapons. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and once heavyweight boxing champion of the world, complained to a German newspaper that it was \"a joke\u2026 What kind of support will Germany send next, pillows?\"",
      "Zelensky turned down any idea of leaving his capital to form a government in exile. He abandoned his presidential dark suit for military attire, and in videos and on social media told Ukrainians he would fight alongside them.",
      "Ukraine defeated the Russian thrust towards the capital. Once the Ukrainians had demonstrated that they could fight well, the attitude of the Americans and Europeans changed. Arms supplies increased.",
      "\"Putin's mistake was that he prepared for a parade not a war\" a senior Ukrainian official recalled, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"He didn't think Ukraine would fight. He thought they would be welcomed with speeches and flowers.\"",
      "On 29 March 2022, the Russians retreated from Kyiv. Hours after they left, we drove, nervously, into the chaotic, damaged landscape of Kyiv's satellite towns, Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel. On the roads the Russians had hoped to use for a triumphant entry into Kyiv, I saw bodies of civilians left where they were killed. Charred tyres were stacked around some of them, failed attempts to burn the evidence of war crimes.",
      "Survivors spoke of the brutality of the Russian occupiers. A woman showed me the grave where she had buried her son single-handed after he was casually shot dead as he crossed a road. Russian soldiers threw her out of her house. In the garden, they left piles of empty bottles of vodka, whisky and gin that they had looted and drunk. Hastily abandoned Russian encampments in the forests near the roads were choked with rubbish their soldiers had discarded over the weeks of occupation.",
      "Professional, disciplined armies do not eat and sleep next to rotting piles of their own refuse.",
      "Three years on, the war has changed. Although Kyiv has revived, it still has nightly alerts as its air defences detect incoming Russian missiles and drones. The war is closer, and more deadly, along the front line, more than 1,000 kilometres long, that runs from the northern border with Russia and then east and south down to the Black Sea. It is lined with destroyed, almost deserted villages and towns. To the east, in what was Kyiv's industrial heartland of Donetsk and Luhansk, Russian forces grind forward slowly, at a huge cost in men and machines.",
      "Echoes of the past",
      "Last August, Ukraine sent troops into Russia, capturing a pocket of land across the border in Kursk. They are still there, fighting for land that Zelensky hopes to use as a bargaining chip.",
      "Along the border with Kursk, in the snow-covered forests of north-eastern Ukraine, the geopolitical storm set off by Donald Trump is still not much more than a menacing, distant rumble. It will get here, especially if the US president follows up his harsh and mocking verbal attacks on president Zelensky with a final end to military aid and intelligence-sharing, and even worse from Ukraine's perspective, an attempt to impose a peace deal that favours Russia.",
      "For now, the rhythm built up in three years of war goes on, and the forest could be a throwback to the blood-soaked twentieth century. Fighting men move silently through the trees, along trenches and into bunkers dug deep into the frozen earth. In stretches of open ground, anti-tank defences made of concrete and steel stud the fields.",
      "The 21st century is more present in the dry and warm underground bunkers. Generators and solar panels power laptops and screens linked to the outside world, and bring in the news feeds.",
      "Just because bad news arrives doesn't mean that the soldiers look at it. In a deep dug-out lined with bunks made of rough planks from the local sawmill, with nails hammered into the timber to hang weapons and winter uniforms, Evhen, a 30-year-old corporal said he had more urgent matters to think about \u2013 his men and the wife and two small children he left at home when he joined up, ten months ago.",
      "That's a long time on the front line in Kursk. He looks and sounds like a combat veteran. He has faced the North Koreans who have been sent to join the battle there by their leader, Putin's ally, Kim Jong Un.",
      "\"Koreans fight till the end. Even if he is injured and you come to him, he might just blow himself up to take more of us with him.\"",
      "All the soldiers we interviewed asked to be referred to by first names for their own security. Evhen seemed relaxed about fighting on without the Americans.",
      "\"Help is not something that can last forever. We have it today, we don't have it tomorrow.\"",
      "Ukraine, he said, was making many more of its own weapons. That's true, especially when it comes to attack drones, but the US still supplies sophisticated systems that have damaged the Russians badly.",
      "A bitter fault line",
      "Many of the volunteers who took up arms three years ago have either been killed, maimed, or are too exhausted to fight any more. One of Ukraine's most bitter fault lines runs between those who fight and those who bribe their way out of military service. Evhen said they were better off without them.",
      "\"It is better for them to pay not to fight than to come here and run away, tripping us up. It doesn't bother me much. If they came here, they'd just scarper\u2026 they're deserters.\"",
      "War strips away surplus thought. The stakes are straightforward for soldiers preparing to return to the battle in Kursk. Mykola, who commands a company of airborne assault troops, spoke affectionately about the capabilities of their Stryker armoured vehicles, supplied by the Americans.",
      "\"Kursk\" he says, \"shows the enemy, a nuclear weapons state, that a non-nuclear power with a smaller population and a smaller army can come in, capture land and the Russians have been able to do very little about it.\"",
      "Putin's objectives, he said, were clear.",
      "\"His task is to seize all of Ukraine, change its legal status, and change the president and government. He wants to destroy our political system and to make Ukraine his vassal state.\"",
      "He laughed when I asked whether the Americans and others should trust Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"No! I don't have enough fingers to count how many times Putin lied. To everyone! To the Russians, and to us, and to Western partners. He lied to everyone.\"",
      "Growing up in war",
      "At a volunteer centre in Kyiv in the first days after the invasion, I met two young students, Maxsym Lutsyk, 19, and Dmytro Kisilenko, 18, who were signing up to fight.",
      "When they lined up alongside men old enough to be their fathers as well as other teenage recruits, they carried camping gear and could have been friends off to a festival, except for their assault rifles. At the time, I wrote \"18 and 19-year-old lads have always gone off to war. I thought in Europe we'd got past that.\" A few weeks later, Maxsym and Dmytro were in uniform and manning a checkpoint just behind the Kyiv front line, still students joking about their parents.",
      "Both fought in the battle of Kyiv. Dmytro chose to leave the army, his right as a student volunteer, when the fight switched to the east. He is preparing to fight again if necessary, training to be an officer at the National Military University. Maxsym stayed in uniform, serving in the front line in the east for more than two years. Now he is an officer working in military intelligence.",
      "I have stayed in touch with them as, like millions of other young people here, war shapes their adult lives in ways they never expected. Trump's move towards Moscow makes them feel almost as if they have to start again.",
      "\"We mobilised,\" Dmytro says. \"We mobilised our resources, our people, and I think it's time that we repeat it once again.\"",
      "Parallels with the past",
      "Unlike the men in the forest on the Kursk border, they follow the news. Donald Trump's diplomatic and strategic bombshells, starting at the Munich security conference only 10 days ago, reminds them of the infamous deal Britain's prime minister Neville Chamberlain made at Munich in 1938, forcing Czechoslovakia to capitulate to the demands made by Adolf Hitler.",
      "\"It's similar,\" Maxsym said. \"The West gives an aggressor an opportunity to occupy some territories. The West is making a deal with the aggressor, with the United States in the role of Great Britain.\"",
      "\"It's a very dangerous moment for the entire world, not only for Ukraine,\" Maxsym went on. \"We can see that Europe is starting to wake up\u2026 but if they wanted to be ready for the war, they should [have] begun a few years ago.\"",
      "Dmytro agreed about the dangers ahead.",
      "\"I think that Donald Trump wants to become like a new Neville Chamberlain\u2026 Mr. Trump should be more focused on becoming more like Winston Churchill.\"",
      "The Trump effect",
      "If you're a real estate developer, as Donald Trump was before he went into reality TV and then presidential politics, demolition makes money.  Acquire a property, tear it down, rebuild and win. The trouble with that strategy in foreign policy is that sovereignty and independence don't have a price tag. Trump boasts he puts America first, but he is not prepared to accept that non-Americans can feel the same about their own countries.",
      "Since Trump was sworn in for the second time as president of the United States, he has been swinging the wrecking ball. He sent Elon Musk into the federal government to recoup billions of dollars he claims are being stolen or wasted. Abroad, Trump the demolition man has set about the assumptions that underpin the 80-year alliance between the US and European democracies.",
      "Donald Trump is unpredictable, but much of what he is doing he has talked about for years. He is not the first American president to resent the way its European allies have saved money by sheltering behind the US defence budget. The phrase used by his defence secretary Pete Hegseth to his Nato partners, that \"President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker\" was a conscious reference back to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.",
      "A US government document from 4 November 1959 records his frustration. It says: \"The President said that for five years he has been urging the State Department to put the facts of life before the Europeans He thinks the Europeans are close to 'making a sucker out of Uncle Sam.'\"",
      "Trump wants payback. He demanded half a trillion dollars of mineral rights from Ukraine. Zelensky turned that deal down, saying he couldn't sell his country. He wants security guarantees in exchange for any concessions.",
      "In private, European politicians and diplomats recognise that, with Joe Biden, they gave Ukraine enough military and financial support not to lose to Russia, but never enough to win. The argument for more of the same is that Russia, weakened by sanctions and drained of manpower as its generals squander their men's lives, will eventually lose a war of attrition. That is far from certain.",
      "Wars usually end with agreements. Germany's unconditional surrender in 1945 was a rarity. The complaint against Trump is that he has no real plan, so he has followed a gut instinct to get closer to Vladimir Putin, a man he admires. Trump seems to believe that strong leaders from the most powerful states can bend the world into the shape they want. The concessions Trump has already offered to Putin reinforce the idea that his top priority is normalising relations with Russia.",
      "Confronting Putin",
      "A more credible plan would have been to include a way to make Putin drop ideas that are lodged deep in his geostrategic DNA. One of the strongest is that Ukraine's sovereignty must be broken and control of the country returned to the Kremlin, as it was in Soviet times and before that in the empire of Russia's Czars.",
      "It is hard to see how that happens. The idea is as unlikely as Ukraine surrendering its independence to Moscow. Europe's security is being turned upside down by the war in Ukraine. No wonder its leaders are so badly rattled by all they have heard and seen this month.",
      "Their challenge is to find ways to avoid their young people being forced into the unexpected world of war that has enveloped Maxsym Lutsyk, the 22-year-old Ukrainian combat veteran.",
      "\"Everyone changed, and I have changed. I think that every Ukrainian matured during these three years. Everyone who entered the military and everyone who was fighting for such a long time drastically changed.\"",

    "summary": "When was the last time two musicals were up for best picture? And could Adrien Brody break a record?",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not.",
      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for best actor, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother Ingrid Bergman was nominated five times in her career, winning twice.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful film about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",
      "\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

      "She added that \"we are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature\".",
      "Ukraine has been facing growing pressure from the US administration to sign the deal, which has ended up in the centre of the growing rift between the US and Ukrainian presidents.",

      "The idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine.",
      "On Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.",
      "Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",

      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",
      "On Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\".",

      "Prior to Stefanishyna's assertion that a deal was close, there appeared to be several sticking points.",
      "Last Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a reported 50% share of its rare earth minerals - which Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.",
      "\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.",
      "The provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.",
      "Instead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.",
      "Trump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.",
      "However, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.",
      "Zelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.",
      "On Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".",
      "He rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".",
      "Some commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\" but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\""

    "summary": "Moving accounts of some of the men and women behind the striking images that have encapsulated the war.",
    "story": [
      "In the three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, hundreds of photographers have documented the human impact of the war on the front line and in civilian areas.",
      "Some of them have shared  stories about their photos which have appeared in BBC coverage since February 2022.",
      "Vlada and Kostiantyn Liberov",
      "Prior to the full-scale war, this husband and wife team worked as wedding and portrait photographers in the Black Sea port city of Odesa. They soon moved \"from capturing love stories, to documenting Russian war crimes\", recalls Vlada.",
      "She knows first-hand the risks in her work. An explosion on a visit to the Donetsk region in 2023 left her with shrapnel lodged deep in her side, which doctors decided could not be removed.",
      "This powerful shot taken by Kostiantyn Liberov in the summer of 2024 was featured in Paul Adams' report on the Ukrainian offensive over the Russian border in Kursk.",
      "A soldier is seen consoling his desperate comrade after returning from an assault in which a fellow serviceman was killed.",
      "For Liberov, the image mirrors some of the confusion within the military over the operation.",
      "\"To lose your friend in an attack inside Russia, rather than defending our country in Ukraine, is very difficult,\" he said. \"I took this photo because of the emotional impact it had on me. It says a lot about the situation and how hard it was for them.\"",
      "Photographing such deeply affecting scenes has taken its toll on local photojournalists. \"It's not something we talk about a lot with colleagues as it's painful,\" says Vlada. \"You are in a very hard situation, and no-one quite understands what the solution can be.\"",
      "One 2023 photo of hers captures a member of Ukraine's White Angels police unit after an unsuccessful attempt to convince one of the last remaining residents to leave the eastern city of Aviidvka before Russian forces sweep in.",
      "The story was part of a BBC article on a devastating 24-hour Russian bombardment.",
      "A man had asked the police unit to evacuate his brother from the basement of a burnt out building, and yet he still refused to leave.",
      "\"The next day we could not return because of hard shelling,\" Vlada remembers. \"The situation got much worse and I'm not sure he could have survived. It hurts knowing you cannot return to these places.\"",
      "In documenting so much loss and suffering, the couple have found a deeper appreciation of moments of joy.",
      "Dmytro, who has fought in Ukraine for more than a decade, was photographed after his wife gave birth in March 2024.",
      "\"We used to take photos of him in the trenches. And then you see this big, brave soldier crying while he takes his small daughter in his hands, and you understand soldiers like him fight for these moments. Not just for themselves, but for everyone in Ukraine.\"",
      "Valeria Demenko",
      "Since 2016, Valeria Demenko has chronicled the work of Ukraine's state emergency service (DSNS) in the north-eastern Sumy region, and she now joins rescue teams deployed to areas hit by Russian shelling.",
      "\"It's always difficult\u2026 you never know what danger awaits you. It is especially difficult when residential buildings come under attack\".",
      "One moment engraved on her memory involved a striking image featured in a story in March 2024 showing emergency workers at the scene of a five-storey building that collapsed after Russian shelling, with residents still inside.",
      "Valeria recalls how emergency workers attended the site for four days straight. They found four dead, but never recovered the body of a missing girl.",
      "\"There was a doll on one of the upper floors... it meant a child was living there, and there may have been more.\"",
      "Although all her colleagues are emotionally stretched, she wants the world to see their work: \"We give every last ounce of strength to document Russia's crimes against peaceful Ukrainians.\"",
      "Alexander Ermochenko",
      "Alexander Ermochenko has spent the past 11 years documenting Ukraine's war as a photojournalist in the eastern Donetsk region.",
      "He has often reported in Russian-controlled territory too and \"never thought I'd be photographing war in my home\".",
      "\"The fear on the face of the owner of a destroyed house is the same on both sides of the front. It is always important to show that blood has the same red colour.\"",
      "The BBC has less access to photojournalists reporting from Russia, as the Kremlin restricts access to international journalists and Russian news agencies are largely state-run.",
      "The BBC approached a Russia-based photographer to contribute to this story but received\u00a0no\u00a0response.",
      "In the above picture, Ermochenko captured jubilant pro-Russian activists on 21 February 2022 after Vladimir Putin declared their eastern region independent. It was published as part of the BBC's coverage of that fateful moment.",
      "He describes how the photo came about \"accidentally\" - a powerful reminder of the potential impact of a photographer's split-second decision to raise their camera.",
      "Ukraine said 300 people were killed when Russian planes bombed Mariupol theatre in March 2022.",
      "The following month, Alexander Ermochenko captured this image, featured in Hugo Bachega's report, in which the photographer conveys the aftermath of a massacre alongside everyday life.",
      "\"The destruction was absolute,\" he remembers, \"with destroyed nine-storey buildings looking like a Hollywood set. But they are real, and recently inhabited by people.\"",
      "\"What was most surprising was that life continued, despite the fighting in neighbouring streets. People looked calm, but in fact they were deeply shocked by what was happening.\"",
      "This photo, used in our live reporting of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant shelling in November 2022, illustrates the difficulty in photographing the war.",
      "\"Pictures of the plant were rare at that time,\" says Ermochenko. \"It is constantly under guard, though the soldiers themselves perfectly illustrate the situation.\"",
      "Despite the challenges he and his colleagues face, he says \"the war is not only a part of my professional career, but a big part of my whole life... no matter how difficult it is, I will continue.\"",
      "Alina Smutko",
      "Based in Kyiv, Alina Smutko understands the human impact of this war through her work as a photojournalist and from personal experience.",
      "\"I've experienced Russian missiles and drone attacks on the city almost non-stop for three years. During this time, I've been constantly worried about my parents, child, friends and colleagues.\"",
      "She feels lucky that her home is intact and her loved ones alive, after witnessing a missile attack on her neighbourhood from her bedroom window.",
      "Initially, she and her friends and family would check in with each other on a daily basis after the full-scale Russian invasion.",
      "But the frequency of attacks has forced residents to learn to live with the war and maintain as normal a life as possible.",
      "The toll on her profession has been hard.",
      "\"We see how our colleagues - photojournalists in particular - were killed or wounded during this invasion. We lost one of our team members, and another colleague has been badly wounded.\"",
      "Smutko tries not to \"overthink\" what she does, but believes it is important to share the effects of the war with the world.",
      "\"I think it helps somehow, but I don't believe in the idea that a picture can stop a war. If it could, we would not have lost so many lives here.\"",
      "\"I still believe that documenting is important. Because if something hasn't been photographed, it hasn't happened.\"",
      "\"This work has to be done\u2026 I just do my best.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 12:17:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Like 1968 or 1989, this could be a year when the world changes in a fundamental way.",
    "story": [
      "Just occasionally, there are years when the world goes through some fundamental, convulsive change. 1968, with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Paris riots and the anti-Vietnam War protests in America, was one of them. 1989, the year of the Tiananmen massacre, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the implosion of the Soviet empire, was another.",
      "I was on hand to see each of these things happen, and from that perspective it seems to me that, only seven weeks in, 2025 could be a year like that: a time when the basic assumptions about the way our world works are fed into the shredder.",
      "The basic reason, of course, is Donald Trump.",
      "Since the end of World War Two, each one of the 13 US presidents before Trump's current term in office has at least paid lip service to a set of key geopolitical principles: that America's own security depended on protecting Europe from Russia, and the non-Communist countries of Asia against China.",
      "Trump has up-ended this approach. He says he's putting American interests first, way before everything else. Mostly that comes down to the single question of how much it costs the US.",
      "In itself, this is pretty hard for his friends and allies abroad, especially in Europe.  But it's made far more difficult by Trump's own personality. No US president in modern times, not even Richard Nixon, let his personal characteristics shape his policies like Trump does.",
      "\"He's just like Louis XIV,\" one retired American diplomat said to me, referring to France's self-aggrandising Sun King.",
      "Critics like this believe Trump is both breathtakingly vain, and amazingly thin-skinned at the same time. As a result, the appointees who surround him, people like Elon Musk and JD Vance, perhaps think that their position depends entirely on how much they praise him and back his views.",
      "'Trump hasn't got any plan': Russians speak to BBC after three years of war",
      "Trump says Starmer and Macron 'haven't done anything' to end Ukraine war",
      "Trump echoes Russia as he upends US position on Ukraine",
      "When President Trump claims, with no evidence, that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is corrupt and has a low approval rating, Musk then takes it further: he piles in to say that Zelensky is despised by the Ukrainian people and is feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers.",
      "No one in the Trump circle today, it seems, will cough discreetly and say, \"Mr President, maybe you should consider rowing back on that statement.\"",
      "Judging from his previous term in office, we can be sure that every one of the people around him knows how he detests being disagreed with. And they will also know that many voters wholeheartedly back Trump's approach, and feel they have been bankrolling security in a far-off continent.",
      "He has committed himself to stopping the Ukraine war by Easter. He is absolutely correct when he says that President Vladimir Putin is keen on this. Russian troops are, through sheer force of numbers, making slow advances in the eastern part of Ukraine.",
      "But the cost in Russian lives is immense. If the process continues, Russia may have to turn to conscription, which would be dangerously unpopular and might even destabilise Putin's regime. Everything Trump says about getting peace is music to his ears.",
      "John Bolton, Trump's far-from-subservient national security adviser during his first administration, said the other day that they'd be breaking out the champagne in the Kremlin when they heard the Trump administration's peace plan. It certainly felt like a historic moment \u2013 not just in Moscow but around the world.",
      "Putin has pointedly backed the idea that Trump really won the 2020 election. It may not be true, but President Putin knows that Trump favours anyone who backs his view of things.",
      "Why, by contrast, have Trump and the people round him come down so hard on President Zelensky? It must partly be because he's not obediently doing what he's told, such as returning to the negotiating table and strike a deal on US access to Ukraine's critical minerals.",
      "At the same time, President Trump understands that Zelensky is the weakest link in the US-Russia-Ukraine trio, and can be squeezed in a way that Putin can't be. The more pressure that is piled on Zelensky, the quicker a peace deal will come.",
      "President Trump never seems, at least in public, to show much interest in the fine detail of any agreement. It's the agreement itself that matters to him, even if Ukraine and its allies believe it's manifestly unfair and allows Russia to come back at some future date and start the war all over again.",
      "British and German diplomats whom I know have been enraged by the way Trump went about getting Russia to the negotiating table. \"He had two major cards in his hand,\" said one. \"The first was Russia's isolation. Putin would have made plenty of concessions to get himself to the talks with America \u2013 only Trump didn't insist on any concessions at all. He just let him sit down and start talking.\"",
      "The other card, the diplomat said, was to insist that Ukraine should be allowed to join Nato. \"Trump could have banged away about this and extorted all sorts of agreements from Putin, before finally saying OK, well, Ukraine won't join Nato in that case.\" In European capitals it's felt that he threw away both of his essential cards before the talks even started, without any preconditions.",
      "Already, though, some European diplomats with experience of US politics are advising their governments that this grand monarchical period in Donald Trump's presidency, where his advisers defer to him (he literally referred to himself as a \"king\" this week), won't last.",
      "Trump currently has control of a pliant Congress and a conservative Supreme Court \u2013 but in only 20 months' time, in November 2026, there will be mid-term elections in the US.",
      "There are signs that inflation is starting to rise in America, and enough people may well be affected badly by the upheavals to want to punish Trump's Republicans.",
      "If he loses control of one or both Houses, the power he has at present of pushing through every plan and policy, no matter how controversial, will diminish.",
      "But an awful lot can happen in the next year and eight months. Trump's expansionism might embolden China. A major international trade war, sparked off by Trump's tariffs, could open up. The European Union seems likely to become politically and economically weaker than ever.",
      "Agreeing peace in Ukraine on Russia's terms will be something entirely new for the United States. In the great majority of negotiations since 1945, Russia has struggled to get its way because of America's economic and military strength.",
      "Now President Putin, having made the costly decision to invade Ukraine three years ago, looks likely to get away with it, and prosper.",
      "If that happens, then 2025 will indeed be remembered as a key year: a moment when the history of the world changed, and nothing was ever quite the same again.",

      "For as long as Nelly Naisula Sironka can remember she has never wanted children - and with one irreversible decision the 28-year-old Kenyan has ensured she never will get pregnant.",
      "Last October, she took the definitive step of undergoing a sterilisation procedure known as tubal ligation - permanently closing the door on motherhood.",
      "\"I feel liberated,\" the organisational development expert tells the BBC, adding that it has ensured her future is now entirely her own.",
      "The operation prevents pregnancy by blocking a woman's fallopian tubes and is sometimes referred to as \"getting your tubes tied\".",
      "Between 2020 and 2023, roughly 16,000 women in the East African country underwent tubal ligation, according to Kenya's health ministry.",
      "It is unclear how many of these women didn't already have children.",
      "Yet Dr Nelly Bosire says the kinds of women coming forward seeking sterilisation in Kenya is changing.",
      "\"Traditionally, the most common candidates for tubal ligation were women who already had multiple children,\" the Nairobi-based gynaecologist told the BBC.",
      "\"But now, we are seeing more women with fewer children opting for the procedure.\"",
      "Sterilisation is only recommended for women who are certain they do not want to have biological children in the future, as reversal is difficult.",
      "\"Doctors don't typically encourage tubal ligation because the success rate of a reversal is very poor,\" said Dr Bosire.",
      "Despite coming from a large family, Ms Sironka said she never felt pressured to start her own - though societal norms in Kenya do place an expectation on women to have children.",
      "She credits her father with her stance as he encouraged her to focus on education - and gave her a love of reading.",
      "Books by US feminist authors like Toni Morrison, Angela Davis and bell hooks were a revelation.",
      "\"I interacted with women's life stories that didn't feature children at all,\" said Ms Sironka, who is now the chief of operations at Feminists in Kenya, an organisation which works to end gender violence.",
      "\"It made me realise that a life like this was possible.\"",
      "She had contemplated sterilisation for years, but decided to go ahead after saving up the money for the operation and finding herself in a stable job that allowed her to take time off.",
      "It cost her 30,000 Kenyan shillings (\u00a3190; $230) at a private hospital.",
      "Ms Sironka felt that women's rights were being eroded around the world - especially as women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, which also influenced her decision.",
      "It made her fear that a woman's right to control her own body might be eroded elsewhere - and that she should do the procedure while she still could.",
      "\"Within Africa and in America, there has been a rise in fascism and authoritarian regimes, a perfect example of such is Kenya,\" she argued.",
      "When she told her family, it did not come as a surprise to them, as she had always been very vocal about her desire for a child-free life.",
      "And as for dating and relationships?",
      "\"I'm still thinking about it,\" she said with a shrug.",
      "And Ms Sironka is not alone in choosing a child-free life, challenging traditional expectations of womanhood.",
      "Across social media, there are those speaking openly about their choice not to have children and undergo sterilisation.",
      "Among them is Muthoni Gitau, an interior designer and podcaster.",
      "She shared her tubal ligation journey in a 30-minute YouTube video last March, explaining her decision to have the procedure.",
      "\"I think the first time I ever articulated... [that] I did not want to have children, I was about 10,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Her mother was heavily pregnant at the time, and a random question about her future popped into the conversation.",
      "\"I saw a possible partner. I saw travelling. I just never saw children,\" she said.",
      "Like Ms Sironka, Ms Gitau's decision was driven by a strong conviction to live life on her own terms.",
      "After trying birth control pills, which she said made her nauseous, she sought a more permanent solution.",
      "When she first approached a doctor about tubal ligation at the age of 23, she was met with resistance.",
      "She was given what felt like a sermon about how children were a blessing from God.",
      "\"He asked me, 'What if I meet someone who wants kids?'\" she said.",
      "The doctor seemed to have more consideration for an \"imaginary person\" rather than the actual patient sitting in front of him, she said.",
      "Ms Gitau said the dismissal was \"heart breaking\". It was another decade before her wish was finally granted.",
      "Dr Bosire points out that a significant challenge in Kenya is getting medics to shift their mindset and truly appreciate a patient's right to make decisions about their health.",
      "\"This ties in with our culture, where people believe it isn't normal for women to want a tubal ligation,\" she said.",
      "Another Kenyan gynaecologist, Dr Kireki Omanwa, admitted the issue was a matter of debate amongst colleagues and in medical circles.",
      "\"It remains inconclusive,\" he told the BBC.",
      "But Ms Gitau was not deterred and last year approached another doctor - this time at a non-governmental organisation that provides family planning services.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 02:15:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The project aims to channel surplus Ken river water to a drought-prone region.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of villagers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are protesting against a multi-million-dollar river-linking project which, they say, will rob them of their homes and livelihoods.",
      "The Ken-Betwa project, with a budget of 440bn rupees ($5.06bn; \u00a34.05bn), will channel excess water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state through a network of tunnels, canals and a dam.",
      "It is the first of 16 such river-linking projects earmarked under India's National Perspective Plan for water resource development in the 1980s. The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year.",
      "The project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment.",
      "The government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy.",
      "But at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam's reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say.",
      "\"Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don't know what the future holds for us anymore,\" said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project.",
      "Most of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living.",
      "Environmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009.",
      "This could undo years of conservation efforts. \"It's unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before,\" says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar.",
      "In 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India's top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region's wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin.",
      "Independent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations.",
      "A 2023 study published in the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours \"may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive\".",
      "Baleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project.",
      "\"We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well,\" he said.",
      "The government official admitted that there would be a potential \"challenge\" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that \"the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts\".",
      "The assurances have done little to comfort the villagers.",
      "In the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song.",
      "\"Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us,\" they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish.",
      "The village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity.",
      "The bitter irony of the river project isn't lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power.",
      "\"We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others' progress. What about us?\" Mahesh Adivasi said.",
      "The government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; \u00a36,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land's value will also be given.",
      "Mr Thakur said that about 90% of the people had chosen to take the lump sum amount. \"In the meantime, the government has started looking for alternative government land to resettle the villagers,\" he added.",
      "But locals say the amount being offered is insufficient. Tulsi Adivasi showed BBC Hindi a government notice which evaluated his house at 46,000 rupees.",
      "\"Can a house be built with this much money?\" he asked.",
      "Others complain they have not been informed when they must evacuate or where they'd be resettled, fuelling anxieties about their future.",

    "summary": "Roberta Flack's intimate vocal and musical style on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\" and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after.",
    "story": [
      "Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose intimate vocal and musical style on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song,\" \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday, her publicist confirmed to CBS News. She was 88.",
      "She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.",
      "\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"",
      "In 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.",
      "She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.",
      "For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges \u2014 for which she was acquitted \u2014 for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, \"Free to Be ... You and Me.\"",
      "Roberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.",
      "Flack's other hits from the 1970s included the cozy \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\" \u2014 a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "\"We were deeply connected creatively,\" Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling \"Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway\" album. \"He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I'd had before or since.\"",
      "She never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of \"Killing Me Softly,\" which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.",
      "Overall, she won five Grammys (three for \"Killing Me Softly\"), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.",
      "\"I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it's our language,\" Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. \"Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling. No matter what challenge life presents, I am at home with my piano, on a stage, with my band, in the studio, listening to music. I can find my way when I hear music.\"",
      "In 2022, Beyonc\u00e9 placed Flack, Franklin and Diana Ross among others in a special pantheon of heroines name-checked in the Grammy-nominated \"Queens Remix\" of \"Break My Soul.\"",
      "Flack was briefly married to Stephen Novosel, an interracial relationship that led to tension with each of their families, and earlier had a son, the singer and keyboardist Bernard Wright. For years, she lived in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building, on the same floor as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who became a close friend and provided liner notes for a Flack album of Beatles covers, \"Let It Be Roberta.\" She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music, based in New York and attended mostly by students between ages 6 to 14.",
      "Flack had taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools for several years in her 20s, while performing after hours in clubs. She sometimes backed other singers, but her own shows at Washington's renowned Mr. Henry's attracted such celebrity patrons as Burt Bacharach, Ramsey Lewis and Johnny Mathis. The club's owner, Henry Yaffe, converted an apartment directly above into a private studio, the Roberta Flack Room.",
      "\"I wanted to be successful, a serious all-round musician,\" she told The Telegraph in 2015. \"I listened to a lot of Aretha, the Drifters, trying to do some of that myself, playing, teaching.\"",
      "Flack was signed to Atlantic Records and her debut album, \"First Take,\" a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz, came out in 1969. One track was a love song by the English folk artist Ewan MacColl: \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written in 1957 for his future wife, singer Peggy Seeger. Flack not only knew of the ballad, but used it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "\"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, D.C. It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. (Flack starts singing a Supremes hit) 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\" she told the Tampa Bay Times in 2012.",
      "\"You have to do all sorts of things when you're dealing with kids in the inner-city,\" she said. \"I knew they'd like the part where ('The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face') goes 'The first time ever I kissed your mouth.' Ooh, 'Kissed your mouth!' Once the kids got past the giggles, we were good.\"",

After years of reflection and now thoughtful, the new team and I have amazing plans for Fyre 2. The adventure seekers who trust the vision and take the leap will help make history.\"",
      "For now, it's unclear what exactly festival attendees are getting for their money. The festival's site promises arts, cuisine, music, comedy, fashion, gaming, sports and \"treasures.\" But no musical artists have committed to performing at the three-day event, slated for May 30 to June 2. Instead, so-called \"Fyre Experiences\" will be released in a number of drops leading up to the festival,\" its website says.",
      "Lostnights, a Mexican festival producer, will produce and operate the event.",
      "What does $1 million buy you?",
      "Most ticket holders have to pay for flights and accommodations separately to attend the festival. But with a $25,000 \"Fyre Phoenix\" pass, attendees \"will stay amongst the artists and other performing talent\" at one of two luxury resorts, the event website\u00a0says.",
      "A package valued at roughly $1.1 million, dubbed the \"Prometheus God of Fyre\" pass, covers accommodations for up to eight people, although other perks are not specified. The pass grants access to \"unique adventures, intimate dinners and other exclusive excursions,\" the festival site notes, without providing additional details.",
      "Guests with the highest-priced pass can choose to stay on either a yacht or in a villa, according to the Fyre website, and will travel by private air travel from Miami to Cancun, then by helicopter to Isla Mujeres.",
      "What happened at the first Fyre Festival?",
      "McFarland also promised a luxury experience at the first Fyre fest, staged in Great Exuma, Bahamas, eight years ago, with Blink-182 and other musical acts expected to perform.",
      "Instead, most pass holders found that their accommodations consisted of unfinished tents and drenched mattresses, with cheese sandwiches for sustenance.",
      "McFarland, who was convicted of defrauding investors of more than $27 million, in 2018 was sentenced to six years in prison. He served four years and was released in 2022. His partner in the first festival, rapper Ja Rule, said the following year that he had been \"hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hoodwinked, led astray\" by the organizers.",

      "The Notorious B.I.G., one of rap's greatest performers, was shot to death at age 24 in Los Angeles in 1997. The case remains unsolved. He was survived by his wife, the musician and actress Faith Evans, and his two children, Christopher Jordan Wallace and T'yanna Dream Wallace.",
      "Wallace was a dedicated keeper of her son's legacy, born Christopher Wallace. When he first emerged on the scene as one of rap's most distinctive talents with songs that expertly detailed street life in Brooklyn, she labeled his music \"noise.\"",
      "Since his death, his gift took on a new meaning for her. She told AP in 2017, 20 years after his death, \"I remembered my son said, 'Don't listen to my music.' And I never listened to his music. I heard it on the radio and it sounded good because it was clean. But I said, 'You know what, I have to. I have to listen to that music.' And that's what I did.\"",

The 2002 lawsuit also named the city of Los Angeles and Muhammad's former college roommate, David A. Mack, a Los Angeles policeman. It accused Mack of hiring Muhammad to shoot the hip-hop artist and police of failing to investigate properly after a fellow officer came under suspicion.",
      "In 2021, Wallace worked as an executive producer on the Netflix documentary \"Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell,\" and told AP about her role in the public eye.",
      "\"They never knew me. The public never knew me. I was thrust into this environment, I should say, after he passed away because I'm a very private person. Extremely private,\" she said. \"What he was doing out there, maybe I should have known. But honestly, I didn't. And to this day, there are people who are saying, 'Oh, she knew.'

      "Divide 18 strangers into three \"tribes\"; drop them on remote islands with little food and no shelter, and have them outwit and outplay one another until the last competitor standing is crowned the winner of a $1 million prize. When the adventure reality game show \"Survivor\" debuted on CBS in May 2000, nothing like it had been seen on American television before.",
      "Asked to describe the series, \"Survivor\" host and showrunner Jeff Probst said, \"It is a social experiment, in that it takes a group of people who don't know each other, and forces them to rely on each other, while playing this game where you vote each other out.\"",
      "Probst invited \"Sunday Morning\" to watch this experiment for ourselves, in Fiji, as he began taping Season 48, which premieres on CBS and Paramount+ this Wednesday.",
      "Asked if he still gets nervous hosting the series for the 48th time, Probst replied, \"I don't get nervous on 'Survivor.' It's weird. I've never gotten nervous. I lean into it. I love the uncertainty.\"",
      "And it's this uncertainty that's made \"Survivor\" one of the most popular shows on television for a quarter of a century. The show averages around 6 million viewers an episode. In the past 24 years, fans have collectively watched ten-and-a-half billion hours.",
      "\"When I knew 'Survivor' was going to be interesting was the first day of the first season,\" said Probst, \"when we abandoned everybody on the beach, and Richard Hatch \u2013 who ended up winning the first season \u2013 got up in a power position in a tree. And he was looking down on everyone, and he said, 'I think we should all talk!'\u00a0 And Sue Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin, looked up and said, 'Where I'm from, we work while we talk.'\"",
      "While Probst had no doubt, \"Survivor\" almost didn't happen. Mark Burnett, the British TV producer behind hits like \"The Apprentice\" and \"Shark Tank\" (and now President Trump's newly-appointed special envoy to the United Kingdom), re-imagined a Swedish reality series (\"Expedition: Robinson\") and took his idea to just about every U.S. TV network.",

And he described the show. I knew when I heard it; I told all my friends, 'This is my show, this is what I've been waiting for.'\"",
      "Today, Probst (now also the showrunner) has his hands in every aspect of production, including combing through more than 15,000 audition tapes that arrive each year. \"I know within 30 seconds, honestly, within 30 seconds, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be on the show or not,\" he said. \"Some people are compelling immediately.\"",
      "People like Stephanie Berger, a technical product manager from New York City, and one of this season's chosen ones. Asked in Fiji what her strategy for the game will be, Berger replied, \"In my, like, day-to-day life, everyone will tell you that I get to be the alpha, like, I like to be in charge. I like control.

      "\"Listen, I am gonna have to lie,\" Fraser said. \"You know, I'm not gonna tell people I'm a lawyer.\"",
      "Contestants not only need to build trust through any means possible; they have to win mental and physical challenges from the moment they arrive, or risk getting voted off.",
      "Probst says what we see is never staged or scripted, including tribal councils, where he grills contestants off-the-cuff, a skill he's developed over time.",
      "I said, \"You're a student of psychology and anthropology.\"",
      "\"Without the degrees!\" Probst laughed. \"I've always loved all of that. I just never formally applied it. I didn't want to be a psychologist; I wanted to be a storyteller.\"",
      "What does make it on television is carefully selected from thousands of hours worth of video shot around the clock for 26 days, in what is one of the largest television productions on Earth. \"It's a great trick, because when you're watching 'Survivor' it does feel intimate, and it is,\" Probst said. \"When the tribes are on the beaches, there's just a small handful of crew there and producers. But when you get to a challenge or tribal council, you know, there's cameras everywhere. We have roughly 400 people that are our international crew. Then we have another 400 Fijians who work with us as well. So, we're close to 1,000 people.\"",

    "title": "Gallery owner Larry Gagosian on the art world's \"blood sport\"",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 09:26:10 -0500",
    "summary": "With 18 galleries around the globe, he's been called \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\" Larry Gagosian talks about his estimated billion-dollar-a-year business and why, at age 79, he's still energized by the hustle.",
    "story": [
      "On any night, he can have art openings in Paris, in London, or at his flagship gallery in New York. With 18 galleries around the globe, Larry Gagosian has more exhibition space than most museums. His annual revenues are estimated at over a billion dollars, which (as The New Yorker put it) may make Gagosian \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\"",
      "In 2022, when Andy Warhol's \"Shot Sage Blue Marilyn\" set an auction record for a 20th century artist at Christie's, the winning bidder was Larry Gagosian. The final price, with fees: $195 million.",
      "I asked, \"That must have been a crazy moment?\"",
      "\"When you're bidding at that level,\" Gagosian said, \"your adrenaline is \u2026 it's very exciting.\"",
      "\"It's a brutal business.\"",
      "\"It's a blood sport.\"",
      "\"What do you love about this most?\" I asked.",
      "\"I love the challenge,\" Gagosian smiled. \"I love winning.\"",
      "Gagosian represents more than 100 artists, and shows the works of Picasso, Warhol, and de Kooning. His clients include billionaire mega-collectors like New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, music mogul David Geffen, and cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder. Gagosian said, \"That's why New York is such a great city for an art dealer, because you have all these super-competitive rich guys trying to (you know, in a certain way) outdo each other \u2013 'I got one.' 'Oh, I got one better.'\"",
      "Gagosian, who grew up in an Armenian family in Los Angeles, never had any formal art training. In the 1970s, he was working as a parking attendant. Then he saw somebody selling posters on the street. \"I saw that and I said, 'Jeez, I could do that.' And so, I bought basically the same posters, I literally paid a dollar apiece, and then put a little aluminum frame on them and put 'em on a peg board and tried to get as close to twenty bucks as I could, which is a pretty good profit margin.\"",
      "He built it into a business, and started having shows. In 1981, a young New York artist caught his eye: Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gagosian bought three of his paintings on the spot. \"And sadly, I sold them all. Wish I still owned them!\"",
      "He'd give Basquiat his first West Coast exhibition, which put Gagosian's gallery on the map. \"It was a big deal in L.A.,\" he said. \"We did the show and it was, like, mobbed. The buzz was \u2013 I'd never experienced anything like that in my gallery.\"",
      "But Gagosian knew that New York was the center of the art world, and in 1985, he relocated.",
      "How was he received in the New York art world? \"They didn't like me,\" he said. \"I guess they thought I was gonna, you know, cause some trouble.\"",
      "\"Well, you kinda did!\" I said.",
      "\"I'd rather not go into that litany, but I was roughed up quite a bit by competitors, I think very unfairly.\"",
      "He earned a nickname, \"Gogo,\" which he says actually started when he was young. \"When I was kid, my friends had a hard time pronouncing my name, Gagosian. And that's really where it started. But then it became, people associate it with something else.\"",
      "But Gagosian made an important ally, the esteemed dealer Leo Castelli. On a walk together one day, Castelli stopped a non-descript man in the street: \"And so I said, 'Well, who was that?' 'Oh, that's Si Newhouse.' And I'll never forget his very words: 'He can buy anything.'\"",
      "Newhouse, who owned the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, would become Gagosian's first big client. At Sotheby's 1988 auction of Jasper Johns' painting \"False Start,\" they sat side-by-side: \"He didn't want to be seen bidding,\" said Gagosian. \"So, he would literally nudge me when he wanted to bid. And I bid, I think it was $17 million. And he got the painting.\"",
      "It was a record for a living artist at the time. \"It was, you know, like, jaw-dropping,\" Gagosian said.",
      "But that price seems almost quaint today.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think there's a billion-dollar painting out there?\"",
      "\"Maybe; I don't see why not,\" Gagosian replied. \"A young artist, if he's really talented, can sell for a million dollars.\"",
      "I asked Gagosian about the comments of one of his former rivals, Arne Glimcher of Pace Gallery, who said five years ago, \"This market has nothing to do with art. It's all about how fast one can make money.\"",
      "\"You know, there's a certain truth to what he's saying,\" Gagosian said, \"but I don't think it's just about money at all. I don't think, if people didn't love art, you know, I think they wouldn't buy it at that level. I don't think it's just an asset class. And it's not just about money. It's just gotten more expensive to buy really great art.\"",
      "\"Do you think in any way it distances ordinary people from loving art?\"",
      "\"No. I think it actually makes art seem more interesting. Wow! Somebody spent X amount of money for a painting? Wow, that's fascinating!\"",
      "Gagosian \u2013 who's had some high-profile romances, is single, and has no children \u2013 is still energized by the hustle. \"I guess to a degree I thrive on it,\" he said. \"It gives you something to go for.\"",
      "\"Why do you thrive on it?\"",
      "\"Cause I'm tenacious. And because I like to win.\"",
      "\"What's the win for you?\"",
      "\"The win is to keep it going. The win is to survive at the top. There's no real finish line.\"",
      "But there is, of course. Gagosian turns 80 in April. And the man who GQ magazine called \"The closest thing the art world has to a Caesar,\" still has no plans of succession for his empire.",
      "So, can there be a Gagosian without Gagosian? \"I don't know; that's the question,\" he said. \"I don't want to think it's an impossibility. I think it's a serious challenge. But I'm not ready to pass the reins. I enjoy it too much.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are you ever gonna be, do you think?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Well, it kind of means you're, like, never at rest.\"",
      "\"Well, there's no time to rest, really. It's overrated!\" he laughed.",

    "summary": "As The Sims celebrates its 25th anniversary, its legacy is undeniable.",
    "story": [
      "As the year 2000 ushered in the new millennium, boy bands and pop stars dominated the music charts, and the International Space Station welcomed its first crew, while back on Earth, reality TV was forever changed by an inaugural group of castaways on the CBS show \"Survivor\" \u2014 all when more than 70% of Americans didn't own a cellphone and only half of U.S. households had a computer.",
      "Phil Salvador, library director for the Video Game History Foundation, reflected on this era of rapid technological growth.",
      "\"If you were playing especially computer games back then, you were probably playing on the family computer,\" Salvador  said.",
      "It was a time when gaming hardware was evolving, and titles like Halo and first-person shooters were on the rise. But one game development company, Maxis, was trying something different: simulation games, designed to replicate real-life activities.",
      "At the helm was legendary game designer Will Wright, who had a personal reason for exploring the genre.",
      "\"Will Wright actually lost his home in the Oakland Hills Fire in 1991, and he had to start rebuilding his life, and that became the inspiration for his idea of Dollhouse,\" Salvador said.",
      "Initially a virtual construction game, Dollhouse failed to draw much interest. But when Maxis was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1997, EA recognized the quirky potential of the game.",
      "Salvador noted that EA realized that people liked telling stories and interacting with the simulated people more than the game's original objective: to construct homes. It was around this time when EA changed the concept from Dollhouse to The Sims.",
      "The Sims spent nearly a decade in development, ultimately creating a digital space where players could control virtual beings, environments and life choices. When the game debuted in February 2000, it was unlike anything seen before.",
      "\"It is a game where you're helping people do chores around the house and use the toilet and things like that, and it's not the most immediately compelling game idea, but once people started seeing it hands-on, I think they realized there was something special happening there,\" Salvador said.",
      "Despite the competition from PlayStation 2 and Xbox, The Sims quickly became a cultural phenomenon. By 2002, it had become the best-selling PC game in history.",
      "\"It is \u2026 humbling to look back on all of the people that we've impacted,\" said Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, Technology and Central Development. \"Multiple generations of people grew up with The Sims.\"",
      "The franchise has redefined what it means to be a gamer, with women making up around 60% of the most recent game's player base. With over 500 million players, The Sims remains the largest brand in life-simulation games.",
      "Miele credits the game's successful longevity to it being an open canvas for creators to express themselves no matter their age.",
      "\"A player, whether you're 12 or 82, you can always be connected at the culture that you love through The Sims,\" Miele  said.",
      "The Sims continues to resonate with culture-makers too. This year, Grammy award winner Doja Cat joined The Sims' celebratory 25-hour livestream, as did Chappell Roan, the newly crowned best new artist who expressed interest in being Simmified, aiming to join the likes of the Black Eyed Peas and Glass Animals' Dave Bayley, who have recorded their songs in Simlish, the fictional language created for the game.",
      "\"Simlish was a brilliant, brilliant concept for The Sims, I have to say,\" said Rachel Franklin, EA's senior vice president and group general manager of lifestyle entertainment. \"What it does is it allows the player to be able to say, 'Hmm, I think they're saying this,' and allowing for choice and creativity and meaning that's directly connected to the player.\"",
      "Under Franklin's direction, The Sims 4 has become the most widely played title in the franchise, offering players unparalleled control over the customization of their Sims and their environments.",
      "\"We get stories all the time about how people, for example, they want to be an architect, and so they go and they play with building in The Sims, and that translates into, 'Hey, I was able to get my dream job as an architect because of all of that time I spent playing,'\" Franklin  said.",
      "\"There's also a lot of people that experiment with their own lives in The Sims, where some people will build a family, find what makes them happy through this cause and effect with these little people,\" she said. \"It's a safe space, and it's an optimistic universe. It's a place where, in the end, it all works out.\"",
      "As The Sims celebrates its 25th anniversary, its legacy is undeniable.",
      "\"In terms of importance, it is very close to the top of the list,\" said Salvador. \"When you think about games that really broke ground for what video games could be, you see, you know, Doom, which is the game, one of the first games that was a first-person shooter that really clicked on. You see something like Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, obviously. The Sims deserves to be in that same conversation.\"",
      "And as to why the game is still relevant, Salvador said, \"Everybody brings a little of themselves into the game. Everyone gets something a little bit different out of it, far more than what the developers ever intended. How many games can say that?\"",

      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",

      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart.

    "story": [
      "Blake Lively was not alone in her feelings about Justin Baldoni's alleged conduct while making the film \"It Ends with Us,\"\u00a0according to the amended complaint filed Tuesday in New York. The actor alleged that her costar and the film's director made other women uncomfortable on set and their concerns were documented, the complaint said.",
      "The amended complaint from Lively's legal team included new allegations against Baldoni and his business partner, Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Health. It described an alleged incident in 2023 \u2014 after Lively said she reported experiencing \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior\" to various leads on the movie \u2014 where another woman in the cast \"reported her own concerns regarding Mr. Baldoni's unwelcome behavior\" and the ways in which she saw it hurting the film.",
      "Baldoni apparently responded to the cast member, whose name doesn't appear in the lawsuit, soon afterward, according to the document. He apparently acknowledged in writing his awareness of the cast member's concerns and indicated things would change, but according to the amended lawsuit they didn't. The complaint referenced another woman in the cast who later told Lively she felt uncomfortable on set, too.",
      "\"Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited,\" said Lively's attorneys, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, in a statement. The attorneys said their amended complaint contains evidence to support that accusation \"as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants' retaliatory campaign.\"",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been embroiled in a widely publicized legal battle\u00a0since December, when the New York Times published her sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni. She also alleged that Baldoni retaliated after she spoke up about what happened on set. Baldoni has since sued the newspaper and Lively for defamation, seeking $400 million from her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively's accusations against Baldoni have partly centered on his alleged use of retaliation tactics to discourage the actor from speaking up by turning public opinion against her. The amended complaint suggested the retaliatory efforts have devolved into \"dangerously extreme\" acts of cyberbullying, harassment and intimidation, allegedly directed not only toward just Lively, but also toward her family, others in the cast of \"It Ends with Us\" and some witnesses.",
      "\"The culture of fear, intimidation, harassment and threats is the predictable result of an incessant digital campaign to turn social media sentiment as dark and negative as is humanly possible,\" a spokesperson for Lively said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Jed Wallace, the owner of crisis public relations firm Street Relations, was also introduced as a defendant in Lively's lawsuit in the amended version. Wallace, who was named in an initial civil rights complaint Lively filed in California prior to suing Baldoni, has been accused of helping orchestrate an alleged smear campaign to damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out. He has denied Lively's allegations and recently filed a defamation suit of his own against her.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, characterized the amended complaint from Lively as \"unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively's false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening. What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively's lack of actual evidence,\" Freedman told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Lively's attorneys said they would work to dismiss both defamation suits against her. The first trial with Baldoni is set for March 2026.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:33:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Arline Geronimus' research shows how societal pressures like institutional racism, classism, financial stressors or the environmental can impact not just the length of life, but also the quality of life for marginalized communities suffering chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years ago, the public was outraged.\u00a0 It seemed there was a wave of teenage girls, particularly Black teenage girls, getting pregnant. \"This was a new idea, this new deviant class of people, and it was portrayed in these terms that were really not accurate: babies having babies,\" said Arline Geronimus.",
      "Geronimus was at the time a graduate student.\u00a0 The prevailing wisdom was that high rates of infant mortality in the Black community were because women were having children when they were too young. \"I had worked in a school for pregnant teens. And none of what I was hearing, and had taken as common sense myself, was what I was seeing,\" she said.",
      "Geronimus looked at the numbers and found that, actually, younger mothers were having more successful pregnancies. She said, \"For the Black women, the lowest risk ages were in the teens and the late teens. And then they went straight up, so that by the 20s, and certainly by the mid-to-late 20s, there was substantially more risk of infant mortality if you had a baby, compared to if you were 18 or 19. And by 35, things were off the charts.\"",
      "How did people react to what she found? \"Not very well!\" Geronimus said. \"People thought I was promoting teen childbearing. The papers wrote columns where they called it things like, 'Research Queen Says Let Them Have Babies.'\u00a0 I got death threats.\"",
      "Geronimus became a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, where she teaches to this day. She lowered her profile, but also widened her perspective, examining indicators like the lower life expectancy of Black Americans (72.8 years) compared to white Americans (77.5).",
      "She developed a theory: that stress caused by racism and other societal pressures contributes to poor health. She named it \"Weathering.\"",
      "\"The idea of weathering was connoting sort of how a rock, for example, would be weathered by hundreds of years of rain and wind,\" she said. \"It's gonna affect it [and] absolutely wear it down. I like the word weathering in particular, because it also has another meaning, which is that you weather the storm.\"",
      "The weathering theory deals with not just length of life, but quality of life. For example, while on average Black women outlive white men (76.5 years versus 75.1), Geronimus found that Black women faced shorter active life expectancies (59 years) than white men (64) \u2013 that is, Black women become disabled at earlier ages.",
      "After decades of working on the theory, she pulled it all together in a book called, \"Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society\" (Little, Brown Spark).\u00a0 She defines weathering as the way that structural racism makes life very hard. But there are a lot of different factors. \"This is not something that just affects people of color; it can be a class issue as well?\" I asked.",
      "Geronimus said, \"It can be a class issue, it can be a stigmatized group issue; anybody who's human is capable of becoming weathered, and will become weathered to some degree, if they're also oppressed or marginalized or suffering endless stressors, whether it's environmental or material hardships or hunger, or whether it's the fact that you're not affirmed or valued, and you have to question where you belong, and what it's safe to do or say in different situations.\"",
      "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom has spent much of her career putting Geronimus' theories into practice, trying to overcome the impacts of weathering: \"She endured a lot for this work. And we just have to applaud her. Her courage is remarkable.\"",
      "Wisdom is the senior vice president of community health and equity at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. She also served as Michigan's first surgeon general.",
      "She notes how day-to-day stress actually changes the body down to the cellular level, leading to premature aging. \"The body keeps score,\" she said. \"So, take diabetes, take hypertension, take cardiovascular disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality \u2013 just multiply the poor outcome by two or by three, and that's what you see in the populations of color. So, it's like the Caucasian population can catch a cold, but populations of color actually develop pneumonia.\"",
      "For example, the latest studies show infant mortality rates for Black Americans that are more than double those of white Americans (10.9 versus 4.52).",
      "To take on the challenge, Dr. Wisdom founded the WIN Network, which stands for the Women-Inspired Neighborhood Network. Expectant mothers are given health care, guidance and support through pregnancy and beyond, which has led to maternal and infant deaths falling, and birthweights rising.",
      "Courtney Anderson said the experience of having her third child, Kalani, through WIN was great. \"She's a happy baby. Most happiest baby I got,\" Anderson said.",
      "Anderson had her first child, Kamrine, before she was in the WIN Network. He was followed a year later by his brother, Kristian. \"With my first child \u2026 I had my hands full, kind of stressed. Kind of bummed out. Post-partum depression.\" But she says the support she received through WIN was a major improvement, increasing her happiness, which in turn has impacted her children positively. \"It's going to affect them really well to know that their mom's happy,\" Anderson said. \"When mom is happy, they get it, and they have a lot more.\"",
      "I asked Wisdom, \"What would you say to people who would kind of maybe blow this off and say, 'Everybody has stress, everybody has things to deal with, what's the big deal? Take care of it yourself. Be responsible for your own health'?\"",
      "\"Yes, people should eat healthy, have healthy behaviors, but yet we see the weathering, when we look through the lens of what's really happening in a society,\" Wisdom replied. \"You can do all those things and have a poor outcome. See, the typical narrative is you eat healthy, you go to school, you get a college degree, you have a good life and you live to 80 or 90.\u00a0 That happens with one population. When you find another population that eats healthy, goes to college, gets an education, gets her Ph.D., and dies of maternal mortality, something is wrong.\"",
      "When asked if the concept of \"weathering\" could be seen as another way of making Black people into victims, or building in another stereotype, Geronimus said, \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. Even if you go back to slavery, no one was working harder, or doing more. But the people who pronounce on 'Black people's poverty is self-inflicted 'cause they're too lazy or too irresponsible,' they're just wrong.\"",
      "At the end of the day, it got me thinking about my own family.\u00a0 My parents died in their 70s. Two siblings died in their early 60s \u2026 all of them much too soon.\u00a0 There were certain ailments \u2013 diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure \u2013 that were expected almost, or that just kind of comes with the territory. And Wisdom says it shouldn't come with the territory \u2013 or that the reason it came with the territory was due to weathering.",
      "Wisdom said, \"Many people of color, families say that, 'Oh, we all get diabetes. We all get cancer. I mean, that's part of the natural course of life. That's the life course.' That is not the life course.\"",

Cuts to its grant funding will limit our ability to prove that new conditions are WTC related, and should be added to the list of covered conditions.

    "summary": "Elon Musk's close ties to President Trump is alienating some motorists. Wall Street analysts say that could hurt Tesla.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long been Tesla's public face, convincing consumers to pay premium prices for electric vehicles that promised to help combat climate change. But as Musk has navigated toward conservative politics and emerged as a close adviser to President Trump, some Tesla owners say they are reconsidering their loyalty to the brand.",
      "Wall Street analysts worry the Tesla brand is showing some cracks, with sales falling 1% in 2024 from the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years, even as global EV sales rose 7.3%. They also say Musk's political activities risk alienating consumers, while protests have erupted at a number of\u00a0Tesla dealerships across the U.S. over his proximity to the Trump administration.",
      "\"It would seem that potential consumers for Tesla EVs might be turning away from the company because they don't appreciate Elon Musk's close relationship to President Trump and the administration's tariff policies,\" Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the carmaker's stock has dropped 17% due to the \"visible perceived downside impact\" of Musk's involvement with the White House, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Feb. 19 research note.",
      "The inextricable link between Musk, the world's richest person, and Tesla's brand illustrates both the opportunities and risks of tying a company's fortunes to the personality of a single executive. Musk has led Tesla from its days as a scrappy startup to the world's biggest producer of EVs, growing its valuation to more than $1.2 trillion, making it one of the world's most valuable businesses.",
      "But Musk's recent\u00a0inflammatory public statements\u00a0and his role leading Mr. Trump's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, appear to be turning off some Americans. Consumers' political leanings can play into their decision to buy an electric vehicle, with Democrats three times more likely to buy an EV than Republicans, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of Musk's political activities on the automaker.",
      "Customer dissatisfaction",
      "Among the one-time Tesla fans who have had second thoughts is Minah Oh, 40, of Massachusetts, who told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's political activities led her to sell her Tesla Model X, which she had owned since 2015, in October.",
      "\"I got it because it was great for the environment, and at the time he was more on the liberal side of politics,\" Oh told CBS MoneyWatch about Musk. But, she added, she felt that Musk by last fall had become \"volatile and turned radically right.\"",
      "Oh also said she was concerned that driving a Tesla could signal to others that she's aligned with Musk's political opinions.",
      "\"I wouldn't want people to think I was a Trumper or that I am associated with Elon, because he is so tied to the brand,\" Oh said. \"I am so happy I sold it, because if I was driving it today, in the current climate I would be so embarrassed.\"",
      "Jake Nickell is another former Tesla owner who has distanced himself from the car company because of Musk's evolving reputation. An early EV fan, the Chicago-based entrepreneur bought the first of three Tesla vehicles he eventually purchased, a Roadster sportscar, in 2006.",
      "\"It was super fun to see an electric car company come up and be viable,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. He sold the car for a profit when it was no longer practical for his growing family, replacing it with a Tesla Model S and later a Model X.",
      "But Nickell said he sold the Model X in 2021 because he was unhappy with the vehicle and because of Musk's changing public persona. He replaced it with a car from rival EV maker Rivian.",
      "\"We were not happy with how [Musk] was acting on many levels. It was a slow slide. He started getting into the 'bro' startup culture of cryptocurrency at time, and there were signs that he was sliding into right-wing politics. We didn't want anything to do with that anymore,\" Nickell said of why he sold his family's Model X.",
      "Asked if he'd ever buy a Tesla again, Nickell responded, \"Absolutely not.\" He's now helping his son buy a car and is considering a Toyota Prius or an EV from Volkswagen.",
      "Musician Sheryl Crow is another former Tesla owner who recently distanced herself from the brand, writing in an Instagram\u00a0post\u00a0that she sold her vehicle because of Musk's recent political activities.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" she wrote, adding that she was donating the proceeds of the sale to NPR because the Trump administration wants to cut its federal funding.",
      "Wall Street analysts have voiced concern about the impact of Musk's reputation on the company's sales. That includes in Europe, where Tesla sales in Germany, a key market, fell roughly 60% last month, according to Reuters.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" Ives, who remains bullish on the company's prospects, said in his Feb. 19 report. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November.\"",
      "Tesla's \"net favorability rating,\" which measures consumers' perception of the brand based on survey responses, is at all-time lows, according to Stephen Gengaro, an analyst for investment advisory firm Stifel, who believes that Musk could be hurting the brand's score. Researchers asked consumers if they had a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" impression of Tesla, ranging from \"very favorable\" to \"very unfavorable,\" to determine the rating. Respondents could also reply that they'd never heard of the brand, or that they had no opinion.",
      "Tesla's favorability rating sank to 3%, a six percentage point decline, for the week ended Jan. 28, compared with 9% in January 2024, according to data from Stifel Think Tank Group, the firm's research and analysis arm. In January 2018, the company's favorability rating stood at 33%.",
      "\"[M]any on the Street view Musk spending '100% of his time' with DOGE as creating a negative perception around his Tesla focus,\" Gengaro wrote in a research note.",
      "Partisan divide",
      "More than half of Americans held a negative view of Musk, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2. Views were starkly divided based on political party, with about 7 in 10 Republicans saying they had a favorable view of him, while more than 8 in 10 Democrats said they viewed him unfavorably.",
      "Those changing perceptions may be rubbing off on car buyers, with a February Morning Consult poll finding that about 32% of U.S. buyers \"would not consider\" buying a Tesla, a five percentage point increase compared with a year earlier, according to a recent CNN report.",
      "In states that voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections, the share of repeat Tesla buyers dropped seven percentage points over the past year, falling from 72% at the end of 2023 to 65% by the fourth quarter of 2024, according to additional data provided to CNN by S&P Global Mobility. Repeat buyers in states that voted Republican barely inched higher, rising from 47.6% to 48.2% over the same period.",
      "In California, the country's largest market for electric vehicles, total driver registrations for Tesla's cars fell 11.6% percent in 2024, according to data from Experian automotive. Registrations for all other brands increased 1.4%, California New Car Dealers Association NCDA wrote in a January\u00a0report.",
      "Could Musk's ties to Trump actually help Tesla?",
      "At the same time, some on Wall Street say there are potential upsides to Musk's alliance with Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, the Trump administration may seek to weaken or eliminate federal rules governing Tesla's self-driving vehicle technology, a major initiative for Tesla.",
      "Musk has long had ambitions to launch full self-driving vehicles powered by AI. The company plans to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June, Musk\u00a0confirmed. Yet such efforts have been slowed by federal investigations into vehicle crashes involving Tesla's\u00a0\"Full Self-Driving\" system and by existing safety regulations.",
      "\"Trump's election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that's been stifling Tesla,\" Ives told the Associated Press.",
      "If the Trump administration eases regulations for self-driving cars, it would be \"a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the dip in consumer perceptions of Tesla's brand could simply be a short-term headwind, Gengaro said. And long-term, the company's development of robotaxis and self-driving vehicles could provide much more of Tesla's growth than vehicle sales to consumers, he added.",
      "Tesla's sales struggles also could be based on other issues besides Musk, including mounting competition for EVs from other automakers. And Tesla's sales decline in Germany could be due to a preference among consumers there for electric cars made by homegrown automakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.",

    "story": [
      "Egg prices jumped more than 15% in January from a year ago, with a carton of eggs costing Americans roughly $4.95. Producers blame it on the bird flu that has forced them to euthanize millions of chickens.",
      "With relief not expected anytime soon, some egg consumers are now looking for alternatives, including going to the source itself: Chickens.",
      "Egg consumers search for alternatives",
      "Across the country, several hatcheries who spoke with CBS News said they're seeing significantly more interest in buying chickens.",
      "\"Sales have gone up dramatically for all the people I know that sell chickens,\" Ron Goldsmith said.",
      "Goldsmith said sales of feed for chickens at his pet store, Mike's Feed Farm in Riverdale, New Jersey, have more than doubled since October.",

      "Renting hens has also taken off, with one company, Rent The Chicken, telling CBS News they lend out their chickens for six months at a time.",
      "\"There are a lot of considerations that go into making the commitment to keep chickens,\" said author Kathy Shea Mormino. \"If you travel a lot or have a job that keeps you away from home, most of the day, chickens are not a good pet for you.\"",
      "Known as \"The Chicken Chick,\" Mormino has been raising chickens in her Connecticut backyard for 20 years. She shares her experience on social media and wants people to do their research before committing to raising chickens.",
      "She said not all municipalities may allow you to keep chickens, explaining there could be restrictions on the location of the coop, number of birds and more.",
      "\"The best thing to do is to contact the code enforcement officer in your town to request information about any limitations that may exist with respect to the legalities on your property,\" Mormino said.",
      "Tips for saving on soaring costs",
      "Experts say the costs of raising chickens can quickly add up. A backyard hen in her prime can lay up to five eggs per week, but consumers need to consider the initial cost of the coop, chicks and feed, which could cost thousands of dollars. Meanwhile if you bought a dozen eggs per week at the grocery store, it would be about $300 per year.",
      "\"I always say that they're not just PEZ dispensers,\" Mormino said. \"So how many eggs they lay a week is going to depend on how healthy they are, how young they are, what the seasonal influences are.\"",
      "But there are some tips to save on eggs as prices continue to soar. Experts at Good Housekeeping suggest substituting a fourth cup of Greek yogurt in place of an egg while baking. Liquid left over from a can of chickpeas can also be added to recipes, or whipped into an aioli-like spread in place of mayonnaise.",
      "Bird flu impact",
      "The H5N1 strain of the bird flu has been spreading since 2022. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it's impacted more than 162 million birds across the country.",
      "Mormino said bird flu is a big concern for flocks at home.",
      "\"Bird flu is distributed primarily by migratory waterfowl so they're droppings and other secretions are infected by the virus,\" Mormino explained. \"All you have to do is walk through duck poop at a pond in the local park and now you're carrying bird flu on your shoes, wherever you're going.\"",
      "She added the concern is true for wildlife as well.",
      "\"So all it takes is a mouse to walk through infected droppings from waterfowl that is a carrier and bring it into your backyard. ... But there are certain biosecurity measures that you can take and should be taking as a backyard 'chickeneer' with the prevalence of bird flu.\"",
      "At least 70 people have been affected by the bird flu, and one fatality has been reported. Human cases have been spread through dairy cattle, poultry farms and other animals, CDC data shows.",
      "Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was trying to rehire some of its employees who were fired as part of major cuts made by the Trump administration based on recommendations from Elon Musk's Department of Efficiency, or DOGE. The USDA employees were experts working to combat the bird flu.",

    "story": [
      "Tax filing season is upon us, and some people are worried it may take longer to get their refunds as President Trump says he intends to make\u00a0significant cuts\u00a0to the IRS during its busy period.",
      "Tax experts say these concerns are valid and that it's more important than ever to file early this year, as Americans could encounter tax refund delays, particularly as they get closer to the filing deadline. The Internal Revenue Service began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15, unless a taxpayer asks for an extension.",
      "Mr. Trump is\u00a0expected to fire more than 6,000\u00a0IRS employees by the end of this week, as he doubles down on efforts to cut the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Tax accountant Terrance Hutchins, of Logos Financial Group, said taxpayers should expect longer hold times over the phone and slower customer service in general. He still expends refunds on relatively straightforward returns that are filed early and electronically, though, to appear in a timely manner.",
      "But many taxpayers could experience processing delays as a result of the anticipated cuts.",
      "\"Your refund can be very fast indeed if you receive it by direct deposit, but those promises were made a few weeks ago before the agency knew of the cuts, so it's very hard to say what the impact will be,\" Vanessa Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Will the IRS cuts affect how long it takes to get my refund?",
      "Tax accountants say the advice they always give taxpayers \u2014 which is to file their returns early \u2014 is even more important this year, in light of the anticipated workforce reduction. If the IRS' headcount is reduced, any errors on one's tax return will take longer to remedy.",
      "If taxpayers file close to the deadline or make mistakes in their returns, Hutchins expects a reduced workforce at the agency would lead to one's refund being delayed.",
      "Williams of the Tax Policy Center, said filers in need of assistance should expect slower refunds as a result of long wait times and worse customer service.\u00a0 \"You spend a lot of time on hold, and there are real consequences,\" she said, recalling the 2010s when the IRS was understaffed.",
      "Democratic Senators warned in a letter to the Trump administration Tuesday that potential staff cuts could lead to delayed tax refunds for Americans in 2025.",
      "\"Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement effort,\" the senators wrote. It's essential that the agency responsible for processing refunds be fully staffed to support Americans through tax season and \"answer their questions, process their returns, send them refunds and keep IRS systems online and functional.\"",
      "\"I always advise people to do their taxes as early as they can, partly because hackers can get their social security numbers and file false tax returns,\" Katie Brewer, a Texas-based financial adviser told CBS MoneyWatch. Brewer also expects cuts to lead to longer wait times to have tax-related questions answered by phone, a particularly burdensome for older filers, who aren't as tech savvy and might not be inclined to turn to the IRS' website for advice, she added.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "The IRS says that most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days, if you file your taxes electronically. It can take longer to get a refund on paper returns.",
      "Taxpayers filing electronically can view the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund? tool.",
      "Returns that require corrections or extra review could result in a delayed refund, the IRS notes. That's why Brewer says it's extra important to ensure that there are no errors on your return.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't double check things until after they hit send. But I really encourage to make sure not to mix up any numbers or accidentally add a zero because those are the kinds of things that hinder refunds or make it hard to deal with the IRS to correct them,\" Brewer said.",
      "Who counts on timely refunds?",
      "Millions of Americans count on receiving their refunds in a timely manner, so that they can repay debt, put money into savings, or make a big purchase.",
      "\"Particularly for working families who receive a child tax credit, or the earned income tax credit, these are often essential supports for Americans,\" Williams said. \"Low-income people use their tax refunds to pay off their winter heating bills, or to put money aside to cover spring clothes for their kids.\"",
      "She added that working-class Americans rely on their tax credits for financial stability. \"That's the purpose. To give people stability when they are working and have kids,\" she said. \"It's not a spare $20 someone might be excited to receive as gift or surprise. It's real money that underwrites the economic security of a very large number of Americans.\"",
      "The IRS last year piloted a new, free electronic service called Direct File, that provides public tax preparation services. It's currently available to 30 million Americans in 25 states, and pulls one's personal tax filing information directly from the IRS. Using such a service is one way to increase one's chances of receiving a refund in a timely manner, according to Williams.",
      "Why haven't I received my tax refund yet?",
      "The IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool will tell electronic filers what the status of their 2025 tax refund is 24 hours after they file a return, according to the agency's website. Those filing by mail can view the status of their refund four weeks after they mail in their return.",
      "To use the tool, taxpayers need to enter their Social Security number, or ITIN, their filing status and exact dollar amount of their refund rounded to the nearest whole number.",

    "summary": "Stocks fell sharply after reports signaled concerns that President Trump's policies could be impacting the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks tumbled on Friday after weaker-than-expected economic reports suggested that President Trump's policies could be impacting U.S. business activity, while consumer sentiment dropped to a 15-month low.",
      "Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% on Friday, marking their worst one-day declines since December 18, according to financial data firm FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.2%.",
      "A preliminary report from S&P Global found U.S. business activity is nearing stall-speed, with growth decelerating to a 17-month low. Activity for U.S. services businesses unexpectedly shrank, and many businesses in the survey reported slumping optimism because of worries about policies from the Trump administration, including the potential for new tariffs and domestic spending cuts.",
      "\"Companies report widespread concerns about the impact of federal government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"Sales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.\"",
      "Inflation worries also weighed on the stock market, with a University of Michigan survey finding that consumers are preparing for higher inflation due to potential tariffs. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, such as retailers such as Walmart, the costs are often passed onto consumers, raising prices.",
      "Consumers say they are broadly expecting prices to be 4.3% higher 12 months from now, which is a big jump from last month's forecast of 3.3% inflation, the University of Michigan survey found. That fits with preliminary data the survey suggested earlier, though a divide is evident underneath the surface.",
      "Expectations for inflation are rising for political independents and Democrats, while falling slightly for Republicans.",
      "A third economic report, meanwhile, said sales of previously occupied homes were weaker last month than economists expected. Relatively high mortgage rates have been hurting the housing market.",
      "Walmart, Akamai",
      "Other corporate reports have added to the sense of unease on Wall Street, including Walmart's most recent earnings report. The retailing giant on Thursday provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart shares slipped 2.5% on Friday, following a 6.5% decline on the prior day.",
      "\"With policy uncertainty and weaker retail sales guidance yesterday from consumer spending bellwether Walmart, we may have the catalyst we need for a healthy correction,\" noted Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email.",
      "Akamai Technologies had the sharpest drop in the S&P 500, even though the cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger profit than analysts expected. It lost a fifth of its value and fell 20.6% as investors focused instead on its forecasts for revenue and other financial measures this upcoming year, which fell short of analysts' expectations.",
      "Even within the big companies of the S&P 500 index, roughly 4 out of every 5 stocks fell. Everything from Big Tech stocks that have been bid up amid the artificial-intelligence frenzy to airlines to metals companies fell. Nvidia sank 2.5%. United Airlines lost 5.5%, and Newmont Mining fell 4.4%.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. stock market is still up for the young year so far and is not far from its all-time high set earlier this week. Virtually no one on Wall Street is forecasting a recession anytime soon. But Friday's reports together raise concerns about what's been a remarkably resilient economy, and the ensuing losses on Wall Street were widespread.",
      "Before Friday's sharp drop, the S&P 500 had been heading for a week of almost zero movement. Helping to lift stocks had been a steady parade of better-than-expected profit reports. That worked against worries about stubbornly high inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 12:33:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A grassroots effort is asking American consumers to refrain from making purchases at major retailers for one day in February.",
    "story": [
      "Over the past few weeks, information has been spreading on social media about a nationwide economic protest called the \"Feb 28 Economic Blackout.\"",
      "The call to action \u2014 or rather inaction \u2014 is asking that American consumers refrain from making any purchases at major retailers on Friday, February 28. The protest comes as people continue to endure\u00a0rising prices on everything from food and gas to housing and utilities, epitomized by the soaring cost of eggs which in January\u00a0averaged $4.95 a dozen.",
      "Behind the boycott is a group called The People's Union USA, a self-described grassroots organization founded by John Schwarz, a 57-year-old dad originally from Queens, New York, who has been promoting the consumer blackout for weeks on social media. The People's Union says it has no political affiliation, but focuses on \"fairness, economic justice and real systemic change.\"",
      "Some postings for the event created by online supporters have suggested a targeted boycott of retailers like\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta, Target and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0that have ended their DEI programs to comply with an\u00a0executive order\u00a0signed by President Trump in January. However, official messaging from The People's Union suggests a boycott of all major retailers, with the goal of enacting broader economic change.",
      "\"For our entire lives, they have told us we have no choice ... that we have to accept these insane prices, the corporate greed, the billionaire tax breaks, all while we struggle to just to get by,\" Schwarz said in a video posted to his Instagram account. \"February 28, the 24-hour economic blackout: no Amazon, no Walmart, no fast food, no gas, not a single unnecessary dollar spent ... for one day, we are going to finally turn the tables.\"",
      "The boycott has received support from celebrities including John Leguizamo, Stephen King and Bette Midler, each of whom has posted information on the Economic Blackout on their social media accounts.",
      "Schwarz did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Why February 28?",
      "Schwarz explains on Instagram that he originally picked the Feb. 28 date to provide \"time to get amped up, to push this out there and really spread the word.\"",
      "What is the 24-hour economic blackout?",
      "According to an email circulating for the 24-hour Economic Blackout, The People's Union is urging consumers to halt all purchases, both online and in stores, from starting at 12 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 28 through 11:59 p.m. that same day.",
      "The idea is to halt spending at big corporations, Schwarz said.",
      "\"If you have automatic payments linked up to your bank account of course, we're not talking about disrupting your life,\" he said in a video. \"But do not go out and shop at any big, major store \u2014 if you have to, go to the local pizza place, the small local boutique.\"",
      "Will the Feb. 28 blackout make an impact?",
      "Consumer spending is the bedrock of the U.S. economy, contributing almost 70% of GDP, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But some critics say that halting spending for a single day isn't likely to make much impact on major retailers.",
      "\"A lot of people dismiss the idea, arguing that a one-day spending freeze won't move the needle for major corporations or the broader financial system. And I agree \u2014 it'll likely have a minimal direct impact,\" Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek.",
      "But, he added, the economic blackout could become bigger, snowballing into more events across the U.S. The People's Union is planning additional blackouts aimed at specific retailers, such as an event from March 7-14 to halt spending at Amazon.",
      "Schwarz expresses optimism in his videos that the economic blackout could make an impact. \"If a million people on the 28th do not spend a dime, you might not think out of 360 million people in this country that's a lot, but a million people all on one day not spending their money, that is a hit,\" he said.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says there is an audit every year and that \"all the gold is present and accounted for.\"",
      "The United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox has stored precious metal bullion reserves for the United States since 1937 and has become synonymous for secure and well protected. Along with protecting gold reserves, Fort Knox is currently also used as the Army's human resources command center, and it hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.",
      "\"We're going to open up the the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox,\" Trump said in a speech to Republican governors Thursday evening.",

It was made a permanent installation in 1932 and has been known since then as Fort Knox. The first gold arrived at Fort Knox in 1937 with the 1st Cavalry Regiment called on to guard the shipment.",
      "With the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the Army created the Armored Force at Fort Knox, and thousands of soldiers were ordered there and introduced to the tank. For nearly 80 years, the post was known as the \"Home of Cavalry and Armor.\"",
      "In 2005, the Army decided to move the Armor Center and School to Fort Benning, Georgia, and the Human Resource Command Center of Excellence was established at Fort Knox. In 2013, ROTC Cadet Summer Training was consolidated at Fort Knox. The post hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.",
      "According to the U.S. Mint, current gold holdings at the US Bullion Depository at Fort Knox are 147.3 million ounces. About half of the Treasury's stored gold is kept at Fort Knox.",
      "Heavily guarded vaults seen by few",
      "Has the gold ever been removed? The Mint says only very small quantities have been removed to test the purity of the gold during regularly scheduled audits. Except for these samples, no gold has been transferred to or from the depository for many years. The gold's book value is $42.22 per ounce.",
      "The depository is very secure. The actual structure and content of the facility is known by only a few, and no one person knows all the procedures to open the vault.",
      "What is known publicly is that the facility was built in 1936 using 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel. The facility is heavily guarded and has broken its strict policy of not allowing visitors only three times.",
      "In 1974, the US Mint opened the vaults to a group of journalists and a congressional delegation so they could see the gold reserves. The Treasury secretary allowed the visit after persistent rumors that the gold had been removed. Until then, the only person other than authorized personnel to access the vaults was President Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
      "Since then, the vaults have been opened one other time: In 2017, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin visited with Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and congressional representatives. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he would happily arrange an inspection for any senator who is interested in seeing the vaults.",
      "The gold depository at Fort Knox has a reputation for being impenetrable, which has gained it a place in popular culture. As early as 1952, a Looney Tunes cartoon featured Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam digging for gold in Fort Knox. Fort Knox has also been featured in the plot of movies such as the 1964 James Bond spy thriller \"Goldfinger\" and the 1981 comedy \"Stripes,\" which was partially filmed at the post.",

    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits, but executives expressed caution about an uncertain economic landscape.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart shares tumbled on Thursday after the retailing giant provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart slipped $6.93, or 6.7%, to $97.07 in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "\"[W]e have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time, and we don't want to get out over our skis here,\" said Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey on a conference call with investors on Feb. 20.",
      "Walmart executives said the company has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company's most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA is already limited in policing claims of health benefits by makers of supplements and herbal remedies \u2014 a $70 billion industry. Get ready for even less regulation.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, before being named the senior U.S. health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration would liberate Americans from the FDA's \"aggressive suppression\" of vitamins, dietary supplements, and other substances \u2014 ending the federal agency's \"war on public health,\" as he put it.",
      "In fact, the FDA can't even require that supplements be effective before they are sold. When Congress, at the agency's urging, last considered legislation to require makers of vitamins, herbal remedies, and other pills and potions to show proof of their safety and worth before marketing the products, it got more negative mail, phone calls, and telegrams than at any time since the Vietnam War, by some accounts. The backlash resulted in a 1994 law that enabled the dietary supplement industry to put its products on the market without testing and to tout unproven benefits, as long as the touting doesn't include claims to treat or cure a disease. Annual industry revenues have grown from $4 billion to $70 billion since.",
      "With Kennedy now in the driver's seat, the industry will likely expect more: It aims to make bolder health claims for its products and even get the government, private insurers, and flexible spending accounts to pay for supplements, essentially putting them on an equal footing with FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.",
      "On Feb. 13, the day he swore in Kennedy as secretary of Health and Human Services, President Donald Trump issued a \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda targeting alleged corruption in health regulatory agencies and instructing them to \"ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\"",
      "Kennedy has said exercise, dietary supplements, and nutrition, rather than pharmaceutical products, are key to good health. Supplement makers want consumers to be able to use programs like health savings accounts, Medicare, and even benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to pay for such items as vitamins, fish oil, protein powders, and probiotics.",
      "\"Essentially they're seeking a government subsidy,\" said Pieter Cohen, a Harvard University physician who studies supplements.",
      "As the Senate Finance Committee questioned Kennedy during his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing, supporters in the Alliance for Natural Health lunched on quinoa salad in a U.S. Capitol Visitor Center and crowed that the moment had finally arrived for their health freedom movement, which has combined libertarian capitalism and mistrust of the medical establishment to champion unregulated compounds since the 19th century.",
      "\"The greatest opportunity of our lifetimes is before us,\" said Jonathan Emord, the group's general counsel, who has brought many successful lawsuits against the FDA's restrictions on unproven health claims. \"RFK has dedicated his whole life to opposing the undue influence\" of the pharmaceutical industry and \"assuring that our interests triumph,\" Emord said.",
      "In speeches and in a pamphlet called \"The MAHA Mandate,\" Emord and alliance founder Robert Verkerk said Kennedy would free companies to make greater claims for their products' alleged benefits. Emord said his group was preparing to sue the FDA to prevent it from restricting non-pharmaceutical production of substances like biopeptides \u2014 complex molecules related to drugs like Ozempic.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not respond to a request for comment on the agency's plans vis-\u00e0-vis dietary supplements.",
      "While the basic law governing the FDA establishes that a substance alleged to have treatment or curative effects is by definition a \"drug,\" and therefore comes under the agency's requirements for high standards of scientific evidence, the new administration could reallocate money away from enforcement, said Mitch Zeller, former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "As a Senate aide early in his career, Zeller investigated a tainted L-tryptophan supplement that killed at least 30 people and sickened thousands in the U.S. in 1989. The scandal led the FDA to seek heavier regulation of supplements, but a powerful backlash resulted in the relatively weak supplements law of 1994.",
      "Even that law's enforcement could be undercut with a stroke of the pen that would keep FDA inspectors out of the field, Zeller said.",
      "Sweeping changes couldn't come too soon for Nathan Jones, founder and CEO of Xlear, a company that makes products containing xylitol, an artificial sweetener. The Federal Trade Commission sued Xlear in 2021 for making what it called false claims that its nasal spray could prevent and treat COVID.",
      "Jones points to a handful of studies evaluating whether xylitol prevents cavities and infections, saying the FDA would require overly expensive studies to get xylitol approved as a drug. Meanwhile, he said, dentists have been bought out by \"Big Toothpaste.\"",
      "One can hardly find any products \"without fluoride for oral health,\" he said. \"Crest and Colgate don't want it to happen,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's desire to rid water supplies of fluoride because of its alleged impact on children's IQ is welcome news, he said, and not only because it could highlight the value of his products. Jones stresses, as do many health freedom advocates, that clean air and water and unadulterated food do more to prevent and cure disease than vaccines and drugs. For example, he and other advocates claim, wrongly, that the United States eliminated the crippling disease polio through better sanitation, not vaccination.",
      "The Alliance for Natural Health hopes that in lieu of strict FDA standards, Kennedy will enable companies to make expanded marketing claims based on evidence from non-FDA sources, Verkerk said, such as the National Institutes of Health's nutritional information site, which describes the pros and cons of different supplements.",
      "Kennedy has also called for relaxing the strictures on psychedelic drugs, which interest some veterans as potential remedies for such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder. VETS, a San Diego-based organization, has paid for 1,000 veterans to get treatment with the powerful hallucinogen ibogaine at clinics in Mexico and other countries, said the group's co-founder, Amber Capone.",
      "She got involved after her husband, a retired Navy SEAL, pulled out of a suicidal spiral after spending a week at an ibogaine clinic near Tijuana, Mexico, in 2017. She wants NIH, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund research on the illegal substance \u2014 which can cause cardiac complications and is listed as a Schedule I drug, on par with heroin and LSD \u2014 so it can be made legally available when appropriate.",
      "Coincidentally, the push for less onerous standards on supplements and psychedelics would come while Kennedy is demanding \"gold-standard science\" to review preservatives and other food additives that he has said could play a role in the country's high rate of chronic diseases.",
      "\"Put aside the fact that there's precious little evidence to support\" that idea, said Stuart Pape, a former FDA food center attorney. \"There's been no indication they want the same rigor for supplements and nutraceuticals.\"",
      "Although most of these products don't have major safety concerns, \"we have no idea which products work, so in the best case people are throwing away a ton of money,\" Zeller said. \"The worst-case scenario is they are relying on unproven products to treat underlying conditions, and time is going by when they could have been using more effective FDA-authorized products for diseases.\"",
      "Supplement makers aren't entirely unified. Groups such as the Consumer Healthcare Products Association and the Council for Responsible Nutrition have advocated for the FDA to crack down on products that are unsafe or falsely represented. The Alliance for Natural Health and the Natural Products Association, meanwhile, largely want the government to get out of the way.",
      "\"The time has come to embrace a radical shift \u2014 from reactive disease management to proactive health cultivation, from top-down public health diktats to personalized, individual-centric care,\" Emord and Verkerk state in their \"MAHA Mandate.\"",

    "summary": "The employees who will be affected \u2014 in a single division of the IRS \u2014 are expected to be notified Thursday that they've been fired.",
    "story": [
      "Over 6,000 Internal Revenue Service employees are expected to be terminated by the end of this week, according to a source familiar with the agency's plans. More than half of these employees \u2014 over 3,500 \u2014 are expected to be from just one division at the IRS, according to text of an email obtained by CBS News and shared by an IRS employee.",
      "The email was sent to managers of the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed Division Wednesday, and it says that the affected SBSE employees will be notified Thursday by the IRS Human Capital Office.",
      "The email, signed by SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert and SBSE deputy commissioner Maha Williams, says that \"while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week.\"",
      "According to the email, the probationary workers who are expected to be fired \"were not deemed as critical to filing season.\" The layoffs are expected to take place a couple of weeks before the tax filing season reaches peak activity, in mid-March through mid-April. The New York Times was first to report that 6,000 IRS employees are expected to be cut.",
      "According to an email sent to IRS managers in one division Thursday morning, probationary employees terminated were supposed to receive these emails by 12 p.m. ET. Managers were not copied on these emails, but CBS News obtained a copy of the termination memo.",
      "The guidance said all separation actions will be final Thursday. Terminated employees are to be paid for a full day Thursday, and the guidance says \"administrative leave will cover the balance of the day after they depart.\" Federal probationary employees who have worked for under a year are not entitled to severance.",
      "Managers were instructed to inform any employees who planned to be on leave on Thursday that their leave was canceled and they were to report to the office with their equipment. If this is \"not practical,\" the email said, managers were to ensure terminated employees read their notice and sent an email to IT to provide information for prepaid labels and boxes to return their equipment.",
      "The email also also included a list of national tax groups to help connect employees with accounting backgrounds and \"tax return preparation experience.\"",
      "The IRS is carrying out some of the highest numbers of mass terminations known so far at a department or agency \u2014 and these figures represent only a single department within the IRS. Managers in the IRS Large Business & International Division also received an email that asked them to come into the office Thursday and Friday \"to support offboarding activities.\" It did not specify a number of employees that could be terminated.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to the IRS and White House for comment.",
      "The IRS has tens of thousands of employees \u2014 it used 82,990 full-time equivalent positions to carry out its work in 2023. Under former President Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act boosted IRS funding over the next decade by $80 billion. A fraction of this, $1.4 billion, was rescinded in a bill passed by Congress in 2023.",
      "The anticipated layoffs are taking place after the Trump administration and the Office of Personnel Management issued a directive to cut probationary workers across federal agencies. The federal government's probationary workers are those who are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment in their position.",
      "This past weekend, an IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an internal data system within the IRS that houses Americans' individual personal tax information. An executive order signed by Trump in early February instructed agency heads to work with DOGE and initiate \"large scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The Wednesday email to SBSE managers goes on to say that later Wednesday, they would receive a list of the employees who are to be terminated. After telling managers to instruct employees to be in the office at the end of the week, the email also asked SBSE managers to be in the office for the rest of the week.",
      "The SBSE division makes sure small business owners comply with their tax obligations, like filing their taxes, and it offers help with debt resolution. It serves more than 57 million small business owners and entrepreneurs with less than $10 million in assets, according to the IRS website.",
      "\"IT will be available to help secure equipment. If IT is not available, managers will secure equipment,\" the email to SBSE managers reads. It adds that there will be a guide and FAQ guide \"to help guide managers through this difficult process.\"",
      "Some LB&I employees were also called and emailed Wednesday to be summoned to the office later this week and were told to bring any government-issued equipment with them, like access cards and paper case files.",
      "\"Under an executive order, IRS has been directed to terminate probationary employees who were not deemed as critical to filing season. We don't have many details that we are permitted to share, but this is all tied to compliance with the executive order,\" according to the text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "Before cuts of the probationary workers at several agencies began last week, federal employees were offered a \"deferred resignation\" buyout program by the Trump administration. The program offered employees the option to resign and go on administrative leave while retaining their pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Over 75,000 employees opted in before the program's deadline, according to the White House. The program is facing legal challenges, but a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled in early February that the program could continue. Within an hour of the ruling, the Office of Personal Management announced the deadline to participate had passed.",

The 2024 rule made mishandling wheelchairs a violation of the federal Air Carrier Access Act.",

      "\"Progress has been made in four key areas aimed at improving the travel experience for passengers with mobility aids \u2014 reducing instances of wheelchair mishandling, advancing employee training and education programs, forming passenger accessibility advisory groups and supporting research for onboard accessibility solutions,\" it stated.",

      "Finalized in December, the rule requires that airlines offer annual training for workers who interact with disabled passengers, and that those with disabilities get prompt assistance during their travels. If a wheelchair is checked but is delayed, missing or damaged, the rule requires that passengers be told options including the right to file a claim or receive a loaner device.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\" Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",
      "\"I wouldn't be budgeting a $5,000 expense in the near term,\" Jacquez said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:39:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk had claimed that DOGE found evidence of 150-year-olds receiving Social Security benefits.",
    "story": [
      "People who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" the new head of the agency said Wednesday, contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over that age are receiving checks.",
      "Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" said Lee Dudek, the new acting Social Security Administration commissioner who was placed in the role by President Trump, in the Feb. 19\u00a0statement.",
      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "Social Security and COBOL",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birth dates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago.",
      "The news organization WIRED first reported on the agency's use of COBOL, a programming language which is more than 60 years old.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\"",
      "DOGE at the Social Security Administration",
      "Dudek, who was named acting chief of the Social Security Administration after the resignation of Michelle King, reiterated the agency's commitment to transparency. The last lines of the statement acknowledged recent reporting about people older than 100 receiving benefits from the agency.",
      "In the statement, Dudek added that the agency's priority continues to be \"paying beneficiaries the right amount at the right time, and providing other critical services people rely on from us.\"",
      "He noted that DOGE personnel \"CANNOT make changes to agency systems, benefit payments, or other information. They only have READ access.\"",
      "\"I am confident that with DOGE's help and the commitment of our executive team and workforce, that Social Security will continue to deliver for the American people,\" Dudek said.",
      "Treasury clawbacks",
      "In early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\"The real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there's an easy fix to Social Security's financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\" Slavov said. \"This is simply not true.\"",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\"A previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\" she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration's whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an uncommon style of giving that has brought meaningful change to charities, a new report finds.",
    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has pioneered a new kind of giving that has proved transformative for nonprofit organizations.",
      "Since 2019, Scott, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $32 billion, has given away $19 billion in no-strings-attached gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits, meaning the recipients of the donations were permitted to spend the funds however they saw fit. The median gift size was roughly $5 million. She identified organizations she deemed worthy of support through \"quiet research,\" or a discreet vetting process, and didn't accept solicitations for donations.",
      "That's according to new\u00a0research\u00a0from the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) which found that the uncommon size and lack of restrictions of Scott's charitable gifts have not only helped those nonprofits become more financially stable but has enabled them to increase the scope of their impact.",
      "\"There is much to learn from the experiences of nonprofits who received grants using Scott's approach,\" CEP vice president of research Elisha Smith Arrillaga said in a statement. \"These organizations have managed large gifts in strategic ways that have impacted thousands of lives \u2014 whether doubling or tripling the number of individuals receiving food from food banks, or increasing the number of houses being built in towns across the country, or countless other examples.\"",
      "For the report, which is the culmination of a three-year study, CEP surveyed roughly 800 organizations that received gifts from Scott on how the donations affected their efforts.",
      "Organization leaders surveyed said they managed the grants with an eye toward long-term sustainability, and most \u2014 90% \u2014 said the gifts from Scott strengthened their financial positions, compared with organizations that did not receive such grants. Half of nonprofit heads also said that Scott's gift made fundraising easier, and many said they the gift attracted new contributions. Only a few \u2014 7% \u2014 said they lost funders because of the grant.",
      "Some funders expressed concerns that such large grants would make it hard for their groups to continue fundraising, a fear that never materialized and a notion the study dispels.",
      "Community impact",
      "Grant recipients also said they put part of the money they received toward programming efforts, and that they've observed meaningful change in communities as a result.",
      "\"We received the grant December 2022, during which we served migrants from 29 countries, and were able to expand that to 71 countries in 2023,\" one grantee said in a statement. \"In 2023, our staff provided legal orientation to over 12,000 refugees, helped reunify over 200 unaccompanied children with their family members in the United States, and coordinated life-saving shelter and medical treatment to over 1,600 migrants.\"",
      "One group that received funding from Scott said the grant allowed their charity to grow from serving meals to approximately 2.5 million people a day, to 10 million. The grants also had an effect within community organizations, notably by boosting leaders' confidence in the work they do, according to the report.",
      "\"Receiving this grant has helped to rewrite my own narrative of who is capable of being a leader,\" one nonprofit leader said in the report, adding that the confidence boost led the group to expand its programming, take more risks, raise its profile and feel more secure in asking for larger grants from other funding sources.",
      "\"We need more unrestricted gifts like the one we received to help really make a difference in the work we do! We are extremely grateful to MacKenzie Scott for graciously gifting us this funding, which will go a long way to helping us achieve our programmatic and scale goals,\" another gift recipient said in a statement.",
      "For her part, Scott is quoted in the report as saying that the motive behind not issuing restrictions around how groups could allocate the funds was rooted in her belief that those who are closest to the work are best positioned to identify the organization's needs.",
      "\"I needn't ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that his meeting with\u00a0French President Emmanuel Macron\u00a0marked an \"important step\" in ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, as Mr. Trump's return to the White House has indicated a likely tipping point in American support\u00a0\u2014 and a possible rift with France and other European allies.",
      "Mr. Trump and Macron, who have a long-standing relationship after both came to office in 2017, held a bilateral meeting and news conference Monday afternoon, after participating in a Group of Seven leadership call earlier in the day to mark three years since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Macron is the first European leader to visit the White House since Mr. Trump returned to office last month.",
      "\"France is America's oldest ally, our cherished partnership has been a force for freedom, prosperity and peace from the very beginning,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're now working on some very interesting developments, one in particular, as you know, the war between Russia and Ukraine.\"",
      "Citing France's support during the American Revolution and during World War II, Mr. Trump said the purpose of the meeting was to \"end another battle,\" the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"The horrors of this gruesome and bloody war can scarcely be underestimated,\" Mr. Trump said, citing the Russians and Ukrainians who have \"needlessly died.\" \"It's time to end this bloodletting and restore peace, and I think we're going to do it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called his meeting with Macron an \"important step\" toward achieving a permanent peace between Russia and Ukraine. He said it's in the best interest of the U.S., Ukraine, Russia and Europe more broadly to \"stop the killing now and bring the world to peace.\" He added that he hopes his legacy will be of \"a peacemaker and a unifier.\"",
      "Macron reiterated that France and the U.S., along with European leaders, are committed to reaching lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia, while outlining how Europe would take on a larger role.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying one of the first calls he made when he returned to the White House was to the Russian president, and he said the White House has been working on \"deals right now\" to end the war through a ceasefire or a broader agreement.",
      "\"They want to end this war,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Macron said with the new U.S. administration, there's \"good reason for President Trump to reengage with President Putin,\" while warning that Putin could violate a negotiated peace. Macron said \"being strong and having deterrence capacities is the only way to be sure it will be respected,\" saying the U.S. \"has the capacity to do so.\"",
      "\"A lot of my European colleagues are ready to be engaged, but we do need this American backup because this is part of the credibility of the security guarantees. And this is our collective deterrence capacity,\" Macron said. \"And I have the feeling that the president has this capacity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said it's \"to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal,\" adding that he's confident that Putin wants to make a deal.",
      "The meeting came as more than a dozen Western leaders, including European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, gathered Monday in Kyiv to show their continued support three years into the war with Russia. Meanwhile, the U.S. has reopened relations with Putin and sought to negotiate an end to the war, marking a major shift from the Biden administration. Preparations are underway for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin, Russia's deputy foreign minister told state media on Saturday.",
      "Mr. Trump has also escalated a public feud with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in recent days, calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator.\" And Mr. Trump has argued that Ukraine should give something to the U.S. in return for the American aid the country has received, pointing to U.S. interest in Ukraine's rare minerals.",
      "Over the weekend, Zelenskyy said he would be willing to step down in exchange for Ukraine's entrance into NATO military alliance.",
      "In a\u00a0post\u00a0Monday on Truth Social after the G7 meeting, Mr. Trump said everyone \"expressed their goal of seeing the War end,\" while claiming that it would never have started had he been in office. The president also said he expressed the importance of a rare minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine in the meeting, adding that he hopes the deal will be signed \"very soon.\" He also said he is engaged in \"serious discussions\" with Putin \"concerning the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Maryland blocked the Trump administration from carrying out immigration enforcement actions at places of worship for three religious groups.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland blocked the Trump administration on Monday from carrying out immigration enforcement actions at certain places of worship for Quakers, Cooperative Baptists and Sikhs, who filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's unwinding of a Biden-era memo that barred immigration arrests at certain protected locations.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang granted a request for a narrow preliminary injunction sought by the religious groups as they pursue their challenge to Mr. Trump's directive allowing federal immigration authorities to conduct enforcement actions at places of worship. Chuang's order does not block the administration's policy nationwide, and only applies to houses of worship owned or used by the challengers \u2014 the Quakers, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the Sikh Temple.",
      "The groups had argued that the new policy allowing immigration arrests at places that were previously considered protected violates their First Amendment rights and burdens the free exercise of religion under federal law.",
      "Chuang, appointed by President Barack Obama, found that the threat of enforcement action at houses of worship attended by the three religious communities has caused reductions in attendance by not only immigrants who are in the country illegally, but also by those with legal status who fear they may be mistaken for unauthorized immigrants. The court concluded that the new policy from the Trump administration likely violates the faith groups' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment.",
      "\"Where plaintiffs' communal religious exercise will be significantly and adversely affected by reductions in attendance resulting from immigration enforcement actions pursuant to the 2025 policy, armed law enforcement officers operating in or at places of worship pursuant to the 2025 policy will adversely affect the ability of Quakers and Sikhs to follow their religious beliefs or worship freely,\" Chuang wrote in a 59-page opinion.",
      "The court found that the 2025 policy imposes a substantial burden on the groups' exercise of religion in relation to their communal worship and the Cooperative Baptists' immigrant-focused services.",
      "\"Immigration enforcement actions at plaintiffs' places of worship pursuant to the 2025 policy would impose substantial pressure on plaintiffs' to modify their behavior by preventing them from worshipping with a larger and more diverse group of congregants and thereby inhibiting their exercise of central facets of their respective religions,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He said that because the new directive from the Trump administration has already caused a decline in attendance at communal worship, it \"effectively compels\" the religious groups to worship with a smaller congregation and with fewer immigrants, \"even though their beliefs call for worship with as large and diverse a community as possible.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs have thus shown that religious exercise is being hindered by the 2025 policy for entire congregations, including United States citizens and immigrants with legal status, whose ability to worship is undermined by such reduced participation,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate a 2021 memorandum from then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that barred the department and its components from taking enforcement action in certain places that \"require special protection,\" including schools, medical facilities or places of worship. That memo said immigration enforcement action should not be undertaken at houses of worship \"to the fullest extent possible.\"",
      "The court's order requires the Department of Homeland Security under Mr. Trump to abide by the terms of the 2021 memo when pursuing enforcement actions at the three faith communities' places of worship.",
      "Chuang's order does not prevent the Trump administration from conducting arrests in or near places of worship when authorized by a warrant.",
      "Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the religious groups, said they are grateful to the court for limiting the policy.",
      "\"For decades, the government has recognized that everyone \u2014 no matter their immigration status \u2014 should be able to attend houses of worship without fear of a warrantless government raid. Religious institutions should not have to go to court to fight for the right to worship and associate freely that is enshrined in our Constitution,\" she said in a statement in response to\u00a0the court's decision.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive revoking the Biden administration's memo\u00a0was issued on his first day in office as part of a series of executive actions aimed at cracking down on immigration. The Trump administration replaced it with a directive stating that \"it is not necessary\" to \"create bright line rules regarding where our immigration laws are permitted to be enforced.\"",
      "A press release from the Department of Homeland Security further stated that \"criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"",
      "The Quakers are comprised of six different meetings of the Religious Society of Friends. The Religious Society of Friends has practiced the Quaker faith in the U.S. since the 1600s, and \"yearly meetings\" are its highest organizational bodies. The group has argued that the communal aspect of its worship is key to the exercise of the Quaker faith.",
      "The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship is a network of churches, worshippers and partners that includes more than 1,400 congregations. Its congregations operate in 37 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Many congregations have a large number of immigrants as members, according to court filings, and some of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship's congregations are engaged in ministry focused on immigrants and refugees.",

      "It marks a setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. But it also shows some diminished support for Ukraine, whose resolution passed 93-18, with 65 abstentions. That's lower than previous votes, which saw over 140 nations condemn Russia's aggression.",
      "The United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favor of its proposal, according to a U.S. official and a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. They refused, and then the assembly added language to the U.S. proposal making clear that Russia invaded its smaller neighbor in violation of the U.N. Charter.",
      "The vote on the amended U.S. resolution was 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting \"yes,\" the U.S. abstaining and Russia voting \"no.\"",
      "Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its \"inherent right to self-defense\" following Russia's invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter's requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations.",

      "U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops \"have failed to stop the war,\" which \"has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.\"",
      "\"What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,\" Shea said.",
      "The dueling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the transatlantic alliance with Europe over the Trump administration's extraordinary turnaround on engagement with Moscow. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary talks last week.",
      "In escalating rhetoric, Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \"better move fast\" to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Mr. Trump was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space.\"",
      "Since then, the Trump administration not only declined to endorse Ukraine's U.N. resolution, but at the last minute proposed its own competing resolution and pressed its allies to support that version instead. It comes as Mr. Trump hosted French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington.",
      "The U.S. also wanted a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the council presidency this month, has scheduled it for Monday afternoon.",
      "The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the 15-member Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia's veto power.",
      "There are no vetoes in the assembly, and the Ukraine resolution, which is co-sponsored by all 27 members of the European Union, is almost certain to be adopted. Its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion, but the resolutions passed there are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council.",
      "Since Russia forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Assembly has approved half a dozen resolutions that have condemned Moscow's invasion and demanded the immediate pullout of Russian troops.",
      "The votes on the rival resolutions \u2014 which have sparked intense lobbying and arm-twisting, one European diplomat said \u2014 will be closely watched to see if that support has waned and to assess the backing for Mr. Trump's effort to negotiate an end to the fighting.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away two appeals from abortion rights opponents asking the justices to overrule a 25-year-old decision that allowed for buffer zones around abortion clinics, leaving that ruling in place.",
      "In declining to wade into the court fight, the justices will not add a second abortion-related case\u00a0to their current docket, following two terms in which the issue was before them. Last June, the court rebuffed two separate challenges involving abortion \u2014 the first over access to a popular pill used in medication abortions, and the second over how Idaho's near-total ban on the procedure interacts with a federal emergency care law.",
      "In June 2022, the court's conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade. Citing that landmark decision, anti-abortion rights groups had called on the Supreme Court to reverse its 2000 ruling in the case Hill v. Colorado, which involved buffer zones outside facilities to perform abortions.",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the requests to hear the cases. In a dissent from the Supreme Court's denial of the appeal in one of those disputes, involving an ordinance passed by the city council in Carbondale, Illinois, Thomas said the high court should make clear that its 2000 decision \"lacks continuing force\" and should be explicitly overturned.",
      "The decision in Hill v. Colorado \"has been seriously undermined, if not completely eroded, and our refusal to provide clarity is an abdication of our judicial duty,\" he wrote.",
      "The ordinance enacted in Carbondale came just six months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority rolled back the constitutional right to abortion. Known as the \"Disorderly Conduct Ordinance,\" the restriction was put in place in response to the high court's ruling, as reproductive health care clinics in the city reported an uptick of threats and acts of intimidation by people protesting abortion access.",
      "Illinois law protects the right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood opened a new facility in Carbondale in December 2023 as the state saw a spike in patients seeking abortion care from neighboring states that restricted abortion after Roe's reversal. Two other clinics were also opened in the city, which is located in southern Illinois near the Missouri border.",
      "Carbondale's measure created a 100-foot buffer zone around the entrance to health care facilities. Activists were prohibited from coming within eight feet of a person to give them a \"leaflet or handbill,\" display a sign or engage in \"oral protest, education or counseling\" inside the perimeter.",
      "The ordinance took effect in January 2023 but was repealed several months later. The Carbondale City Council said it had not been enforced against any potential violator.",
      "Before the measure was rolled back, the Missouri-based group Coalition Life challenged it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. Coalition Life organizes sidewalk counselors who seek to provide information and assistance to women approaching abortion clinics, including alternatives to terminating their pregnancies.",
      "The group has said their goal is to speak to the patients one-on-one and they believe it's necessary to get close to them \"so they can make eye-contact and speak from a normal conversational distance in a friendly and gentle manner.\" Carbondale's ordinance, however, hindered their ability to do so.",
      "A federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit agreed to dismiss the case, citing the Supreme Court's 2000 decision in the case Hill v. Colorado. The decision upheld a state law that barred activists from coming closer than eight feet of a person entering an abortion clinic to engage in protest, counseling or education unless they obtained their permission.",
      "The court has heard one other case involving buffer zones outside of abortion clinics since its ruling nearly 25\u00a0years ago. In 2014, the high court unanimously struck down a Massachusetts law that established a 35-foot buffer zone around medical facilities where abortions are performed. The law exempted four categories of people: those entering or exiting the facility; employees; law enforcement or other public workers; and people using the public sidewalk or right-of-way covered by the buffer zone to get to another destination.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in 2000, its makeup has shifted significantly. Conservatives now hold a 6-3 majority, and only one of the justices who heard that case, Thomas, is still on the bench. He joined the late Justice Antonin Scalia and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy in dissent.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday he would be ready to give up the presidency if doing so would achieve a lasting peace for his country under the security umbrella of the NATO military alliance.",
      "Speaking at a forum of government officials in Kyiv marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, \"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready.\"",
      "Responding to a journalist's question on whether he'd trade his office for peace, Zelenskyy said, \"I can trade it for NATO.\"",
      "His comment appeared to be aimed at recent suggestions by President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that elections should be held in Ukraine despite Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law.",
      "Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 strike drones into Ukraine overnight on Saturday, more than in any other single attack of the war.",
      "Ukraine's air force said 138 drones had been shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost en route to their targets.",
      "Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said. One person was killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the city military administration.",
      "The attack came as leaders in Kyiv and across Europe are seeking to navigate rapid changes in U.S. foreign policy under Mr. Trump, who in a matter of days has upended years of firm support for Ukraine, leading to fears that he would join with Moscow to force a settlement to the war without involving Ukraine and its European backers.",
      "Mr. Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy.",
      "Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Mr. Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression, though U.S. officials have asserted that the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine when this week he suggested that Kyiv had started the war, and that Zelenskyy was acting as a \"dictator\" by not holding elections, despite Ukraine's prohibition on them during wartime.",
      "Russia's deputy foreign minister on Saturday said preparations were underway for a Trump-Putin meeting, a further sign that the Russian leader's isolation, at least for the Trump administration, was beginning to thaw.",
      "Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, however, Andrii Sybiha\u200e, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the overnight attack \"demonstrates that avoiding calling Russia an aggressor does not change the fact that it is one.\"",
      "\"No one should trust Putin's words. Look at his actions instead,\" Sybiha\u200e said in a statement on social media.",
      "Ukrainian officials on Sunday discussed a deal that would allow the U.S. to access Ukrainian rare earth minerals, a proposal that the Trump administration is pushing for but that Zelenskyy earlier declined to accept because it lacked specific security guarantees.",
      "At the forum in Kyiv where Zelenskyy made the offer to give up his presidency in return for peace and NATO membership, his chief of staff Andrii Yermak said the government was considering investment opportunities both with the U.S and European countries \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction.\"",
      "Yermak left the forum early along with Economic Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko for what he said were talks with U.S. representatives on a potential deal. He said Ukraine's mineral resources represent \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Yermak pushed back on the notion that Ukraine had rejected U.S. proposals but said any agreement \"must meet the national interests of Ukraine, and undoubtedly, must be interesting to our partners.\"",
      "Before leaving the forum, Svyrydenko said there are $350 billion worth of minerals on Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia. This calculation, however, is partly based on geological maps dating back to 1940s and 1960s, she said, adding: \"We have to conduct geological exploration and confirm the deposits we have on paper.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Putin in a special televised message Sunday praised Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine for defending \"their native land, the national interests and the future of Russia.\"",
      "Putin used his speech, on Russia's Defender of the Fatherland Day, to pledge greater social support for military personnel and new weapons and equipment for Russian forces.",
      "\"Today, as the world is changing impetuously, our strategic course for strengthening and developing the Armed Forces remains unchanged,\" he said, adding that Russia would continue to develop its armed forces \"as the essential part of Russia's security that guarantees its sovereign present and future.\"",
      "The U.K. on Sunday said it would announce new sanctions on Russia Monday, its biggest package since the early days of the war. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the measures would be aimed at \"eroding [Russia's] military machine and reducing revenues fueling the fires of destruction in Ukraine.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 07:27:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over funding for federal safety net programs may lead some state officials to turn to opioid settlement dollars to make up the difference.",
    "story": [
      "At a recent Nevada legislative committee hearing, lawmakers faced off with members of the governor's administration over how to fill gaping holes in the state's upcoming budget.",
      "At issue: whether opioid settlement money \u2014 paid by health care companies that were sued for fueling the opioid crisis and meant to help states abate addiction \u2014 should be funneled to two counties for a safety net program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which is aimed at helping low-income children and families.",
      "Previous funding \"will no longer be available after June 30, 2025,\" the budget proposal says. By then, billions of dollars in covid-era relief from the federal government \u2014 including a set-aside for TANF, which can cover emergency aid, job training, child care, and more \u2014 is likely to have expired.",
      "Recognizing both the need for and uptake of this assistance, Gov. Joe Lombardo's budget proposal directs $5 million in opioid settlement cash to shore up the program in the state's most populous counties, Clark and Washoe.",
      "The prospect of such tradeoffs is smacking many states in the face as they embark on budget season.",
      "Not only is the river of federal pandemic relief that flowed to public health, education, food assistance, child care, and more over the past few years drying up, but a deluge of actions from the Trump administration has thrown into question once-reliable federal funding for a myriad of social services and health care programs. Congressional Republicans have also threatened cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for many low-income people.",
      "Together, these financial headwinds have left many states hunting for alternative funds to maintain crucial services.",
      "Opioid settlement money can seem like an attractive option. More than $10 billion has landed in state and local government coffers in recent years and billions more are set to arrive over the next decade-plus.",
      "But recovery advocates, family members who have lost loved ones to addiction, and legal experts say that money has a specific purpose: to address the ongoing addiction and overdose crisis.",
      "Even if $5 million is a small portion of the hundreds of millions Nevada has received, some say spending it elsewhere sets a troubling precedent. Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a Democrat, raised this concern at the February hearing.",
      "\"There doesn't seem to be a direct link to opioids\" in the governor's proposal directing these dollars to TANF, he said. Settlement money should not be used \"to backfill budget accounts.\"",
      "Richard Whitley, director of the state's Department of Health and Human Services, insisted at the hearing that this was an appropriate use of settlement dollars. The money flowing through TANF will help \"relatives who are raising children whose parents are substance-abusing,\" he said.",
      "In addition, Elizabeth Ray, a spokesperson for the Republican governor, told KFF Health News that the money would help families at risk of losing custody of their children due to substance use, with the goal of keeping kids in their homes and \"ultimately reducing the need for foster care placements.\" Implementing this program through the state's TANF system would \"reduce start-up costs and implementation time,\" she wrote in a statement.",
      "But TANF is available to many families living in poverty and it was unclear how these dollars would be targeted to such a subset.",
      "Similar budget conflicts have surfaced in Connecticut \u2014 whose Democratic governor, the CT Mirror reports, is asking lawmakers to redirect opioid settlement money to social services that were previously funded through other means, including federal dollars \u2014 and Arizona, whose legislature transferred $115 million in settlement money to the state prison system last year to help close a $1.4 billion budget deficit.",
      "National recovery advocate Ryan Hampton expects to see more efforts like this nationwide.",
      "\"I have a very high level of fear that states are going to be tapping into these settlement dollars in every creative way they can to fill some of these budget shortfalls,\" he said. \"It's a grave misuse of funds and one that is going to have dire consequences.\"",
      "Although national overdose deaths have declined recently, tens of thousands of Americans are still dying from overdoses each year. In a few states, including Nevada, such deaths increased in the 12 months leading up to September.",
      "\"The intent of these dollars is to save lives right now,\" said Hampton, who is in recovery from opioid addiction and founded a Nevada-based recovery advocacy organization. He submitted a public comment opposing the Nevada governor's budget proposal.",
      "Hampton and other advocates worry that using opioid funds for services that, even if crucial, are only tangentially related to addiction risks a repeat of the tobacco settlement of the 1990s.",
      "At that time, cigarette manufacturers agreed to pay state governments billions of dollars annually. Initially, states spent a chunk of that money on anti-smoking programs, said Meg Riordan, a vice president of research at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which tracks states' spending on tobacco prevention programs.",
      "But over time, states encountered budget crunches and many raided or dissolved trust funds they'd set up to protect tobacco money. Instead, they funneled the cash directly into their general funds and spent it on infrastructure projects and budget shortfalls.",
      "\"Once the funds start going somewhere else, there's a risk that they won't come back,\" Riordan said.",
      "Tobacco use remains a leading cause of preventable death in America.",
      "The opioid settlements have more guardrails than the tobacco settlement did, but KFF Health News' multiyear investigation found lax oversight and enforcement.",
      "Nevada and Connecticut are among 13 states that have explicitly restricted the practice of supplantation, or using opioid settlement funds to replace existing funding streams.",
      "Whitley, Nevada's DHHS director, and the governor's office have insisted that none of their proposed uses of settlement funds are examples of supplanting.",
      "At the February hearing, Whitley repeatedly suggested that the budget proposal was misworded, creating a false impression. \"We'll clean that up with the language,\" he said.",
      "But he also emphasized the importance of settlement dollars as federal funding sources diminish. \"As ARPA [the American Rescue Plan Act] goes away and other flexible funding goes away to address problems, this becomes one that really we have to rely on,\" he said.",
      "That perspective seems reasonable to JK Costello, director of behavioral health consulting for the Steadman Group, a company that he said is helping about a dozen local governments across the country administer the settlements.",
      "Ideally settlement money adds to existing services, he said, but realistically, some safety net programs, even if they don't directly address addiction, can be a lifeline for people with opioid use disorder. If major cuts in federal spending imperil those programs, using settlement funds to save them could be worthwhile.",
      "\"Getting people into great treatment when their housing voucher is cut isn't really that helpful,\" Costello said. \"Treatment isn't going to work if they're not able to eat or feed their kids.\"",
      "The tricky thing is that many community organizations that work directly on addiction and recovery issues are also feeling the crunch of expiring federal aid and expected federal program changes that would reduce their resources, Costello said. When everyone is strapped, deciding where limited settlement dollars can do the most good becomes increasingly challenging.",
      "Some places presciently set aside opioid settlement funds in \"emergency\" or \"sustainability\" accounts that could be tapped for addiction services in case of declining federal aid. South Dakota has such a fund with more than $836,000, according to its 2024 opioid report. None of it has been used yet.",
      "Kristen Pendergrass, vice president of state policy for the addiction-focused nonprofit Shatterproof, hopes states turn to rainy day funds first, before raiding settlement accounts.",
      "Nevada has $1.23 billion in its rainy day fund, more than the national median, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts.",
      "\"It would be a slippery slope if we stop paying attention now\" and allow settlement funds to be used for anything, Pendergrass said. \"The money was won to remediate harms and save lives. It should be used that way.\"",

      "All U.S. Agency for International Development direct hires deemed non-essential will be placed on administrative leave at 11:59 p.m. ET Sunday, according to an email sent from the Office of the Administrator and reviewed by CBS News.",
      "Those being placed on leave \u2014 an estimated 4,200 staffers \u2014 would be notified by 5 p.m. Sunday, the email said. USAID is also resuming \"voluntary Agency-funded return travel\" for impacted employees overseas, according to the email.",
      "USAID employs more than 10,000 people, according to the Congressional Research Service, with around 4,800 direct hires stationed in foreign and domestic posts.",
      "Per the email, approximately 2,000 personnel in duty stations across the U.S. will also be subject to a reduction in force.",
      "USAID had previously deemed 611 workers as essential amid an initial attempt earlier this month to place the majority of direct hires on leave. But a judge, in response to a lawsuit brought by two unions representing USAID employees, had ordered the agency to temporarily reinstate some 2,100 personnel who had previously been placed on leave while blocking the administration from placing another 2,000 or so on leave. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was appointed by President Trump, also put a stay on orders for overseas personnel to return home.",
      "However, Nichols on Friday chose not to extend the temporary stay.",
      "In a\u00a026-page decision, Nichols said the potential harm asserted by the unions did not warrant emergency relief.",
      "\"Plaintiffs have presented no irreparable harm they or their members are imminently likely to suffer from the hypothetical future dissolution of USAID,\" Nichols wrote, adding that those placed on leave still have the ability to go through the standard process of bringing their concerns before the government body for employee complaints.",
      "While the lift on the stay allows the Trump administration to place USAID workers on leave, a ruling in a separate lawsuit brought by a group of nonprofit organizations and contractors that received funding for foreign aid projects is still preventing the administration from pausing foreign aid, grants and contracts previously appropriated by Congress while legal proceedings continue.",
      "USAID is also establishing a \"Coordination Support Team\" made up of several working groups to \"reduce uncertainty for our employees and to find solutions to logistical issues facing personnel and programs,\" according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The working groups, co-lead by USAID Acting Chief of Staff Joel Borkert and Marcus Thornton, a member of the Secretary of State's policy planning staff, are focused on facilitating safe returns for USAID personnel overseas and their families, maintaining operations for life-saving humanitarian assistance and other programs that have received waivers, and \"addressing logistical challenges,\" the email said.",
      "Established in 1961, USAID was one of the first agencies Mr. Trump and Elon Musk \u2014  who is classified as a special government employee, but who the White House has claimed in a court filing has \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions\" and is not an employee of the\u00a0White House's Department Government Efficiency, or DOGE \u2014 in their efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.",

      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: It wasn't an adversarial meeting, but I was very clear, especially after I found that the Trump administration had ended a program that was put in place, congestion pricing, by the duly elected members of our legislature, representing the voice of the people, and with a tweet, he claims that he is the king, and, therefore, he has the power to destroy it.",
      "And I have a problem with that characterization, because we labored under a king 250 years ago, and, as I said, we're not going back there. So I wanted to take my case to him directly and let him see the benefits of this program, because our city is paralyzed with gridlock. And we had a path forward to be able to make the city move again, and it's working.",
      "I wanted to just have that opportunity to convey that. But I don't know that we're very persuasive on that front, but that's OK. The people in my state need to know I'm willing to take the fight wherever I have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, just to explain for our audience, congestion pricing, you're talking about this $9 toll you put on people driving into Lower Manhattan below 60th Street.",
      "Your fellow Democrat Phil Murphy of New Jersey says he doesn't like this policy, actually asked President Trump to stop it. President Trump's office says this is discriminatory against working-class people. How do you respond to that?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: I respond this way. With all due respect to the state of New Jersey, they do not tell us in New York what to do, nor does Washington, when it comes to policies that we believe are going to reduce congestion, move along vehicles. Emergency vehicles are moving faster. Air quality is improving.",
      "So I have arguments that are important, but no one else should be able to second-guess us, because that's not how our system of laws and states was set up. I'm the governor of New York. I will deal with the internal issues before me without interference from New Jersey or, indeed, the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is going to the courts?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: Oh, yes, it's going to the courts, and I believe we will be victorious in the courts, and this program will continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, this is not the only standoff between the state and federal government and the tension here.",
      "I know you were in Washington with other governors who were meeting with the president this week. Federal funds account for about 40 percent of your state's budget. President Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds to governors in order to force compliance with his agenda.",
      "Here's what he said to the governor of Maine. Take a listen.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Is Maine here, the Governor of Maine?",
      "GOVERNOR JANET MILLS (D-Maine): Yes, I'm here.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Are you not going to comply with it?",
      "GOVERNOR JANET MILLS: I will comply with state and federal laws.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm \u2013 we are the federal law. Well, you better do it. You better do it, because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was about transgender athletes on girls sports teams.",
      "Are you Democratic governors going to start to work together on this? Is there legal pushback?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: What he is doing is \u2013 they've described it as flooding the zone.",
      "They're attacking California when it comes to FEMA dollars. They're filing lawsuits in Illinois. They're going after Maine on this, and they're coming after programs that have been duly put in place in the state of New York.",
      "What they're trying to do is create this theater of all kinds of activity that is trying to be a distraction to us. And when someone floods the zone in a football game, what you need to have is the defenders be very disciplined, smart, but also stand their ground. And that's exactly what New York governors, the governor of New York will do, in cooperation with our governors.",
      "We're not going to sit idly by and let our rights be attacked. We'll work with you when there's common ground, no doubt about it. Let's build great projects and infrastructure. There's areas where we're going to work with you on immigration and getting the violent criminals off our streets. We do not dispute that. But don't think that you can just come in and bully us around and not expect a reaction from governors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know that, when it comes to your state, there's been a lot of focus on Manhattan and the Department of Justice because of Eric Adams and the ongoing legal issues he has.",
      "In the past week, four deputy mayors resigned. Seven federal prosecutors resigned after the Trump Justice Department moved to dismiss those five counts of federal corruption indictments against \u2013 against Mayor Adams.",
      "You know the allegation is that the dismissal of the charges was in \u2013 related to a quid pro quo around immigration compliance. Did you discuss this case at all with the president when you were in the room with him one on one?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: No, I did not. In fact, it's \u2013 we're waiting for the decision by a judge on whether he's going to accept those \u2013 the recommendation for a dismissal. So that's still in litigation.",
      "But I will say this. We are not allowing the Trump administration to interfere in the operations of our city. And the legal problems that the mayor is facing because of the Trump administration, and the phrasing they have used, and, indeed, an interview that was done by one of his representatives on national television, saying that he's basically got the mayor under his control, that's concerning.",
      "And I have to be able to put in safeguards. Of course, everyone says I had the option to remove him. I still hold that option to remove him. It is an extraordinary power. And I know there's a lot of people disappointed and angry and want something done immediately, but I will always stand on the fact that we are a nation of laws.",
      "And one individual, the governor of New York, should not use her voice and her will to override the will of the voters. We have an election in a few months for \u2013 in a primary. I'm going to let the voters decide, but I'm also going to be very cognizant. I need to keep an eye on this situation, especially the way the Trump administration has telegraphed that they want to get into our operations, and I have to be the firewall to stop that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, having said that, does that mean you do believe there was a quid pro quo understanding with Eric Adams?",
      "GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: I am going by what the perception could be. I cannot let the integrity of the administration in the city of New York be undermined by perception that the Trump administration actually created. They created this perception.",
      "The reality, I will never know. But as long as there's the faith of New Yorkers that has been undermined by what the Trump administration doing is trying to give the appearance of holding the city hostage, those are \u2013 but that's exactly what they're trying to do.",
      "Again, they're trying to create chaos. But we have to be smart as Democrats and as leaders and parse through all this and just go do what's right. That will always be my North Star.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Hochul, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff.",
      "He is in Miami Beach this morning.",
      "Good morning to you, sir.",
      "I have\u2026",
      "STEVE WITKOFF (U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a lot to get to with you.",
      "I want to start on the Mideast first. You have said you are headed there this week to work on a hostage deal. I know Prime Minister Netanyahu has changed his negotiating team. Will we get to phase two of this hostage deal? And can we get that American citizen Edan Alexander out any time soon?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: So, I \u2013 we \u2013 we will get to stage two \u2013 or phase two. And I'm very focused on that, and I think it's going to happen.",
      "I'm going there probably Wednesday evening. I will spend five days there as soon as I arrive, making \u2013 going to various countries, including Qatar, Egypt, Israel, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.",
      "And, as to Edan Alexander, he's front and center for us. I know his parents. We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home. And we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in that second phase, talking about what comes next for Gaza becomes part of that. For that day after, do Hamas leaders need to leave Gaza? Are you discussing that? And, if so, where would they go?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: So, Margaret, the \u2013 the May 27 protocol agreement signed last May 27 sets forth that the phase two negotiation is much about two things, A, a permanent cease-fire, a cessation of all violence, and, in addition to that, the fact that Hamas cannot be allowed to come back into the government.",
      "And I think the way you square that circle is that Hamas has to go. They've got to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Physically?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And we're going to \u2013 the negotiation will be around that.",
      "I would say physically. That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Where would they go? Has any country offered to take them in?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I think \u2013 I think the devil is in the details, and we've had a lot of discussions around it. I'm not at liberty to have that discussion, that specific discussion today, but we've got some ideas, and that will be part of the negotiation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been quoted as saying that when you went to Gaza and you personally saw the devastation there, you couldn't understand why anyone would say \u2013 stay, but it doesn't mean you can't have some sort of right to return, if that's the policy that works for people.",
      "Does the Trump administration support Palestinians' right to return?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, Margaret, first of all, what I would say is this.",
      "President Trump is one of the most sensible human beings you're ever going to meet. He is \u2013 he understands that it makes no sense to endorse old policy prescriptions that have not worked. And what has not worked in Gaza are all of these old policy prescriptions.",
      "So, he's come up with a new notion. And the new notion is, let's create a better opportunity for these \u2013 for people who have lived in Gaza to have a better life for themselves, better upside, better aspirations for what can happen for their children and so forth.",
      "The May 27 protocol talked about Gaza as if it was a five-year reconstruction plan. We've been talking in the Trump administration about a 15-year horizon, perhaps even 20 years. And now, all of a sudden, The Wall Street Journal printed an article yesterday agreeing with that math.",
      "There is a much \u2013 level-setting the facts suggest that nobody can really live there in a safe environment for probably at least 15 years. So, effectively, we need \u2013 effectively, people have been under this misassumption. When you're under a misassumption about facts, you're not going to make decisions correctly.",
      "We're making decisions based on a real set of facts. And so there's a lot of work that has to be done there. There's tons of demolition. There's artillery shells all over the place that could explode at any moment. This is a much longer project, and people don't belong living there right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they could return?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: That's \u2013 that's \u2013 again, goes to the devil in the details.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I'm not sure that anyone has a problem with people \u2013 with people returning. We've had these discussions around that.",
      "I just think the fundamental issue today is how we get phase two done and then develop a reconstruction plan for Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And for that, you've got to have a real set of facts. And we've been operating prior to the Trump administration coming in under facts that are just not accurate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about Russia.",
      "You are a very trusted adviser to President Trump, and he sent you to speak face to face with Vladimir Putin. FOX reported you sat with Putin for 3.5 hours. You said that you spent a lot of time talking, developing a friendship and a relationship with Putin, and that's how you helped bring this U.S. citizen Marc Fogel home.",
      "Can you take us inside that room? Did you have a translator? Did you have a notetaker? Were you talking in English? What happened?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: There was a translator. And, in fact, there were two translators.",
      "And I \u2013 to me, the assignment was trust-building and speaking behalf \u2013 on behalf of my boss, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. And I had no expectation as to how long the meeting was going to last. I was intent on carrying a message from the president to President Putin.",
      "I had been advised that the president \u2013 that President Putin had something for me to transmit back to the president. And the meeting ended, I looked at my watch, and it was close to 3.5 hours that we were in there. And, hopefully, that that suggests that a lot of good things got accomplished.",
      "I think that President Trump believes \u2013 and I believe because he believes it \u2013 that trust-building begins with good, proper communication. And we had really good \u2013 we just had a great discussion, me and President Putin. And now it will be up to President Putin and President Trump to work something out. And I think they're going to be successful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you have an intelligence officer or anyone else with you? That's an extraordinary amount of face time with Putin.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I had \u2013 it was just me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was just you.",
      "The head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund \u2013 I know you know him \u2013 Kirill Dmitriev, told Reuters that\u2026",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 afterward, they expect a number of American companies to return to Russia this year.",
      "Is he right to expect that? Did you discuss lifting U.S. sanctions off of Russia?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: We \u2013 we did not have that specific discussion at \u2013 at the meeting you're referring to.",
      "But I think that \u2013 that, obviously, there would be an expectation that, if we get to a peace deal, that you would be able to have American companies come back and do business there. And I think that everybody would believe that that would be a positive, good thing to happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: After the end to the war and concessions were made by Russia?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, that's what everybody wants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And what everybody wants, the \u2013 the beginning of that, Margaret, is \u2013 is \u2013 would be a \u2013 would be a temporary cease-fire.",
      "But \u2013 but the long-term goal would be an end to this. The \u2013 we've had a - - you know, close to a million-and-a-half deaths. And so, you know, President Trump, the \u2013 his \u2013 his agenda is to end this carnage. It just didn't belong to happen \u2013 it didn't need to happen.",
      "And it doesn't need to continue, not, you know, another day. So we're on it, at his direction. And I think there is \u2013 you're going to see some \u2013 some real positive developments in the near-term future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, thank you for joining us.",
      "We'll be back in a moment with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay tuned for our next half-hour, including an interview with Utah Republican Senator John Curtis.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Utah Republican Senator John Curtis.",
      "Good to see you here in person, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS (R-UT): It's nice to be in person. Good morning. And lots to talk about today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely.",
      "I want to get your perspective on the decision by the president on Friday to dismiss not only the chair of the Joint Chiefs but also five other senior military officers. The former chair of the Joint Chiefs, General Martin Dempsey, released a statement saying, \"trust should be based on leadership, integrity and performance. To relieve a senior officer not for a lack of one of those qualities but for a real or perceived disagreement in their beliefs harmfully politicizes the military profession.\"",
      "Are you concerned that's what's happening here?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: You know, I think we have to stop and look what happened really last November. And one of my colleagues describe it this way, it was a stop the car moment. Those of us who have had young kids and been on family vacations know what a stop the car moment is. It's, kids, you're so disruptive, we're stopping the car.",
      "And I think in many ways the American people said, stop the car. We want dramatic change. We're unhappy with what's happening at the border, we're unhappy with the economy, we're unhappy with so many things. You keep promising that you're going to cut spending, and you don't. Stop the car. And so people really shouldn't be surprised that this is a stop the car moment. We don't get to go to Disneyland until we figure this out. And I think that's what people are seeing right now in Washington.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think part of the public frustration, or that there was correct to be frustration, with the leadership at the Pentagon or the president's top military adviser?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Look, we elected a commander in chief last November. This is his discretion. They want change. The people want change.",
      "We all knew what we were getting with President Trump, right? Nobody should be really surprised at the - at these dramatic shocks to the system. The system needs a shock. And I think you're - what you're seeing as a result of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern, though, at a time of geopolitical risk, as our Pentagon correspondent was suggesting there, that, you know, carrying the institutional knowledge with you through a transition, we're still at the beginning of the Trump administration, certainly, that there could be a hiccup there or some complication.",
      "I mean, General Caine is - or Lieutenant General Caine is a - is a three star. He's retired. It's not clear if he needs a congressional waiver or not to take this job because he didn't run a combatant command.",
      "Do you know how complicated it will be to get him in place, or how long?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: So, listen, yes, it - I don't. And I'm not overly worried about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: I'll come back to this, the American people have asked for change. They've lost - lost confidence in so many things. They want to see dramatic change. That - that was a stop the car moment. And what happened at the Pentagon was a stop the car moment. Let's make some change.",
      "We've tried subtle changes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: We've tried the easy changes. We've tried working around the edges. And I think the American people are saying, it didn't work. Let's - let's do something more dramatic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we've certainly seen dramatic. You had the video at the Conservative Political Action Committee of Elon Musk wielding this shiny chainsaw.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's celebrating this Department of Government Efficiency idea.",
      "Yesterday, federal employees also received an e-mail, I'm sure you've heard, telling them to reply by midnight Monday to a message with five bullet points of what they accomplished in the last week. Elon Musk tweeted, failure to do so would result in firing.",
      "Utah has 33,000 federal employees. Is that how they should be treated?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: So, listen, let's go back to $36 thousand - trillion of debt. And we have to do something dramatic.",
      "Now, to answer your question, I don't believe so. You know I just published an op-ed to DeseretNews.com - deseret.com, and I talk about my experience as mayor and having to do similar things. If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it's, like, please put a dose of compassion in - in this. These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. We - it's a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel to do it as well. We can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's not just about efficiency, though. I mean the president himself has characterized this as getting rid of bad people.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: You know, I regret that narrative. We all know, you know, thousands, millions of federal workers who are good people, who work hard. But the reality of it is, we have 3 million federal workers. Not all of them do. Many aren't coming to work. In my work - business -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Working from home, you mean?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Working from home. Let's hope they're working from home. We don't know. That's why the e-mail. What are you doing? It's not unusual, in a corporate setting, to have people report and explain what they're doing, especially if they're working from home. So, I don't think this is a request that is that difficult. I would ask my employees to let me know what they're doing. But I will double down on the fact of, we don't need to be so cold and hard and let's put a little compassion and, quite frankly, dignity in this as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And in that op-ed you said, \"sometimes it is the worst day of someone's life to receive a notice like this.\"",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: It is. Yes, going back to my experience as mayor, we did have to let some people go. We did a lot through attrition. But every single person we let go, I met with personally. I looked them in the eye. I told them why we had to do it. How can we then help you transition to the next thing. We can do both things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's not happening at all right now, as you know. At these department agencies - some of them, they're just getting locked out of systems. People don't even know who to ask. They can't ask HR. And HR says, I don't know, if they can't get ahold of them at all.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Yes. But - but also - I'll also come back to this, stop the car moment. Like, this is not a normal moment. We have tried. We've tried for years to do this gracefully. We've tried for years to do this slowly. And we have failed consistently. And the American people said, enough. We're tired of this. You have to make these changes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you believe the president has the unilateral authority to cancel funds appropriated by Congress?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Well, what we're seeing play out is the wrestle between the three branches of government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: We'll find out. And this is the beauty of the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have a point of view?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Well, listen, I - I believe in the Constitution, right? I believe this is how we test the Constitution. And people have said, oh, this is a constitutional crisis. And I say exactly the opposite, it's proving to work. We have the court's playing in it. We have Congress who will play in it. We have the ability - I think we hold a lot of responsibility for what's happening right now. We could solve the budget as Congress, we could solve the border, and we haven't. And both parties, when Congress doesn't do their job, and the White House, have a tendency to try to solve it.",
      "Let's let this play out by the Constitution and - and then, Congress, let's step up, right? We need to do - I'll be the first to say, we - this is a problem that Congress is, in many cases, has given the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pushback has been relatively quiet. You're gently doing that by saying, be more compassionate.",
      "Senator Murkowski was telling constituents the other day, I can't be the only one speaking out.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: So, listen -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are Republican lawmakers going to be more forceful?",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Well, listen, I don't know what you want me to be more forceful on. Stop the car. Like, fix this. That's what Utahans are telling me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, in terms of the congressional role here, the check that Congress is supposed to put on the executive.",
      "SENATOR JOHN CURTIS: Yes. But I also think that's a stop the car moment. Congress has failed in these - in these things. And the - and the people have said, fix it. So, Donald Trump is trying to fix it with the tools that he has.",
      "The courts will push back if he steps out of line. We've seen that. We know that. We saw that with President Biden as well. And that's the beauty of the system. I works.",
      "Now, it's very - it's - the - the people back home are impatient. If you were to walk on the streets of Utah, they would say, stop the car, John. Like, we - this is not good. You have promised, your colleagues have promised, for decades that you would fix these things, and you haven't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if the fiscal problems are fixed in the near term.",
      "Senator, it's going to be up to you and your fellow lawmakers.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "I want to refer back to the interview we just did with the president's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. You watched the Middle East closely. I know you were just meeting with Arab leaders when you were in - in Europe last week.",
      "He said that it is not realistic to have Palestinians remain in Gaza while it is rebuilt. Egypt and Jordan are working on plans for that to be possible. Does - does that proposal have any chance of surviving, or is this idea of moving them away for 15 years going to happen?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): So, the good news in what Steve Witkoff said was that he expected us to get to phase two of the discussions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE).",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: The very bad news was, he did not disavow this outrageous idea that Donald Trump put on the table of cleaning out 2 million Gazans. That is ethnic cleansing by another name. And Arab countries are right now working very hard to put together a plan to show that you can deal with the governance, security and reconstruction, and that you don't need to, you know, have 2 million people pushed out of Gaza in order to do it.",
      "It is tough. It will have to be done in stages. And they have identified areas in Gaza, few areas in Gaza, that have not been obliterated where you can begin to phase the reconstruction and at least get people housing, temporary housing, as you rebuild in other areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But how does that survive if the United States' most powerful player is saying, that's not what we want to do?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, this is a big problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Because when Trump made those statements, what he did was fueled even more the far, far right in Israel. The Ben-Gvir, the Smotriches who are just celebrating because their idea all along has been to move 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza. They also want to move Palestinians out of the West Bank into places like Jordan and Egypt.",
      "So, in addition to being a reprehensible idea for moral and legal reasons, it would also totally destabilize the region, which is why the Arab countries are working so furiously to put together a plan that addresses these issues and has a future horizon that provides security to both Israelis and Palestinians and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are also hearing that the president is closing in on this deal with Ukraine in regard to its mineral resources that can be used for all sorts of valuable technology. What security guarantees are you comfortable with the U.S. giving to Ukraine as part of any of this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I think this is all negotiable. But what you should not do, Margaret, is begin your negotiation with Putin by, number one, adopting the Putin narrative, saying that Ukraine started this war, which is just a big lie. And you shouldn't begin by giving up certain key cards.",
      "So, for example, American guarantees or a future for Ukraine in NATO. However you settle this in the end is a matter of negotiation. But it's terrible negotiating to give up those cards up front, as - as Trump has done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was extraordinary to hear Steve Witkoff describe his meeting with Vladimir Putin, as he did for us.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I would just say that this is not America first. This is America in retreat. And China and Russia and our adversaries are celebrating every moment of this as our allies are scared to death. And this is not just rhetoric. This is reality. And so -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is what you heard at Munich last week?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, well, and I think, you know, European allies and others from around the world who believe in freedom and democracy, they're wondering whether this is just rhetoric or whether this is a real shift.",
      "My warning to them is, I think this is reality. I think Trump is much closer ideologically to Putin and other autocrats around the world than he is to democratic countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An extraordinary statement to digest.",
      "But I want to ask you about what - what's happening here at home, because you sit on some powerful committees. The administration did have some legal wins this past week. USAID, a federal judge said that they can put on administrative leave thousands of USAID employees. Another district court denied a request from unions to stop the firing of federal employees. Are Democrats too knee-jerk to say that all this is unlawful?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No, this is unlawful. In many of these cases, judges found that the plaintiffs did not have standing, but other parts of their opinion clearly indicated that Elon Musk did not have the authority to do what he's doing.",
      "So, we just talked about the great betrayal of the Ukrainian people. What we're witnessing now is the great betrayal of the American people.",
      "Canada - Trump said he was going to lower prices. Right now what he's doing is slashing important public services that help every American in order to finance a tax cut for the super rich, for Elon Musk and the billionaires.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there was this e-mail that went out yesterday to federal employees. We know that at the FBI and the State Department management inside those agencies has - have told employees, don't respond to the personnel e-mail saying respond with your five bullet points.",
      "Can people working at the State Department feel safe not responding? Are they putting their jobs at risk?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I don't think so because what we are witnessing are illegal actions by Elon Musk. And a number of courts, as you know, have issued temporary restraining orders on their efforts to seize important private information, but also on their overall conduct. So, what the head of management at the State Department said is, Elon Musk doesn't have the authority to require State Department employees to answer these questions. That has to happen in the chain of command.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though the president says he wants him to be more aggressive?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, the reality is, we don't - we don't know what the president meant. But as you pointed out, you've got Elon Musk taking a chainsaw to the federal government and important services. And there's no article four in the Constitution that gives Elon Musk that authority. And the way that he's been sort of, quote, delegating his authority is - there - is illegal. And the actions he's taking are illegal and we need to shut down this illegal operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for your insight today.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's a former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member.",
      "Welcome back, Dr. Gottlieb.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner and Current Pfizer Board Member): Thanks a lot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen these troubling measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico. Nearly 100 people sickened. It looks like most of those who have been infected were unvaccinated and the outbreak area has one of the highest vaccination exemption rates in the state. How concerned are you, though, that this could spread?",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Very concerned. I think this will spread. There's been 100 cases that have been identified so far. There's probably many more than that. So, I think that this is going to get into the hundreds of cases and could take many months to try to fully snuff out.",
      "And when you have that kind of a concentration of measles within a community, it's going to inevitably spread outside that community. When you look around the country, there's a lot of parts of the country, states that have relatively low vaccination rates when it comes to MMR right now. You look at Idaho, about 80 percent oof children have been vaccinated for MMR. Alaska and Wisconsin at about at 84 percent. Minnesota, 87 percent. States like Florida, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia, Utah, around 88 percent. Iowa, I think, is at 89 percent.",
      "And herd immunity is achieved at a vaccination rate of between 93 and 95 percent. And even within those states, it's not like the low vaccination rates are distributed evenly across the states. There's pockets of under vaccination as communities have relatively low vaccination rates. And so, when you have this much virus spreading in that portion of Texas and New Mexico, I think that there's some inevitability that you're going to see cases exported into other states where there's low vaccination rates. And you could see a continuous spread across the country. Even at a low level we could get some endemic spread.",
      "And the risk to the United States right now is that a virus that has been largely extinguished from circulation in the U.S. could return and just continue to spread even at a low level. And the U.S. could be at risk of losing its measles elimination status, which would have more profound implications on things like travel advisories that could be initiated from other countries.",
      "And so, beyond just the public health impact of this, which I think is quite substantial, there could be some economic impacts as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And, finally, when you look at that outbreak in Texas, 27 percent of people have been hospitalized. And there's been four cases where children have contracted measles that have been vaccinated. So, those were probably kids who only had one dose of the vaccine. But there's a lot of people who are at risk of this beyond just the people who have chosen to forgo the vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's terrifying, Doctor. And kids are usually vaccinated, as any parent knows, around one year old roughly.",
      "The MMR vaccine, though, this is the vaccine against measles, is particularly scrutinized. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is now the HHS secretary, has accused it of causing issues in children. He wrote the forward to a book questioning vaccines, saying measles is \"a disease that is rarely life threatening and a vaccine that is largely unnecessary but carries real risks.\"",
      "He is now the HHS secretary. How does he restore confidence in a vaccine that he previously denigrated?",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think it's going to be difficult. And as best I can tell, he hasn't spoken to this outbreak. I think you captured the essence of the argument from Mr. Kennedy, as well as people within his anti-vacs movement, that they believe this vaccine isn't effective. That's not true. It's highly effective. And that measles itself isn't a bad illness. And I think there's been some statements that actually getting measles has certain long-term advantage, which is just patently false. This is a very dangerous virus. And as I said, about 27 percent of the kids who have been infected in that west Texas outbreak and the New Mexico outbreak have been hospitalized. So, this is going to be a quite serious illness with long-term consequences.",
      "Herd immunity is achieved at 93 to 95 percent. We're well below that in most parts of the country. Texas actually has a high vaccination rate and I think Texas local public health officials are doing a good job to try to get control of this outbreak. But now that it's stretched into the hundreds of cases, it's going to be very difficult.",
      "This has been a vaccine that's been studied extensively. The links between - the alleged links between MMR vaccine and autism have been the subject of some of the most - the largest studies ever undertaken. There were two studies done in Denmark, each with about 500,000 children enrolled in those studies. There were also a number of studies that were commissioned by the CDC and the NIH also looking at this in the United States. And so, this is one of the most extensively studied questions, the purported link between MMR and autism.",
      "And I think the reality is sometimes we have to accept no for an answer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That there just is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and those studies were brought up by Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, in the hearing, and Mr. Kennedy would not affirm them. Senator Cassidy still voted for him, though.",
      "But I want to ask you about another issue. Our correspondent, Camilo Montoya-Galvez, has learned the Trump administration is preparing plans to use a health authority, known as Title 42, which you remember was used during the pandemic, to restrict migrant entries across the southern border. Now they want to invoke it on the basis of other diseases like TB. Is that warranted right now? Is TB that much of a problem?",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I - I think from a policy standpoint, the administration has done a good job shutting down flows across the border. So, I'm not sure why they're reaching for a public health measure to try to provide an additional provision, an additional tool. They seem to have done a good job with the law enforcement that they're doing at the border.",
      "Just from the objective standpoint of TB and the risk of TB being transported across the border, TB incidents rates are high in the countries where immigrants are coming from, but they're not exceedingly high relative to other countries. So, you look at a country like Mexico. The - the incidents of TB is about 30 cases per 100,000 people. In Venezuela, where there's a lot immigrants coming from, it's about 45 per 100,000. That compares to about 10 per 100,000 in a country like England. But you look at a country like India, the incidents is about 200 per 100,000. In South Africa it's about 500 per 100,000. So, there's a lot of countries around the world where people come in from all the time where the incidents of TB is much higher than what - what it is in the countries where people are coming across the border from.",
      "Now, you can argue that people coming in the country from South Africa or India going through regular check points where they might undergo some screening, but I think just purely from an objective public health standpoint, there's probably parts of the world where we have immigrants coming in -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That provide a larger risk of the transmission of TB than across the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you give us some perspective on the thousands of employees who are being dismissed from federal health agencies? Should the public be concerned?",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I don't - I don't think they should be concerned. I think that there have been steps taken to try to re-adjudicate some of those initial dismissals, at least within the public health context when you look across HHS, and I'm most familiar with FBA where they're hiring back a number of employees. And I think they could hire back fully half of the employees that were initially dismissed at the FDA. And they've tried to preserve things like review functions and inspectors at FDA. They didn't do it perfectly because of the way they went about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They riffed the probationary employees. So, they did caught some employees that I think are in critical functions. They seem to be hiring them back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know, just objectively, they look at this and they say, well, the number of people hired has gone up a lot in recent years and they want to reduce head count.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And so I think we need to be more judicious about who they target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Gottlieb, I'm sorry, I've got to leave it right there.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, described on Sunday a three-and-a-half hour meeting he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month, part of what he said was a \"trust-building\" assignment given to him by President Trump.",
      "Witkoff traveled to Moscow to bring home\u00a0Marc Fogel, an American who had been serving a 14-year sentence in Russia for traveling with medical marijuana. Russia freed Fogel on Feb. 11. Witkoff told a conference last week that he met with Putin before leaving the country with Fogel.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Witkoff said there were two translators at the meeting with Putin, and he was the only U.S. official present. He said he was \"intent on carrying a message from the president to President Putin\" and that he was told that the Russian leader \"had something for me to transmit back to the president.\"",
      "\"The meeting ended, I looked at my watch and it was close to three and a half hours that we were in there. And hopefully that suggests that a lot of good things got accomplished,\" Witkoff said.",
      "A real estate investor and friend of Mr. Trump's who has taken an outsized role in his foreign policy, Witkoff noted that Mr. Trump believes that \"trust-building begins with good, proper communication.\"",
      "\"We just had a great discussion, me and President Putin, and now it will be up to President Putin and President Trump to work something out, and I think they're going to be successful,\" Witkoff said.",
      "In addition to his trip to Moscow, Witkoff also joined Russian and U.S. representatives at a meeting in Saudi Arabia last week, where the officials agreed to begin working toward an end to the war in Ukraine and related economic opportunities, though no Ukrainian officials were present.",
      "Witkoff said the officials did not discuss lifting American sanctions on Russia, but he noted that if a peace deal is reached, \"there would be an expectation\" that American companies could return to the country to do business.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has argued that Ukraine should give something to the U.S. in return for the American aid the country has received, pointing to U.S. interest in Ukraine's rare minerals. And the president has escalated a public feud with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in recent days, calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator.\"\u00a0Preparations are underway for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin, Russia's deputy foreign minister told state media on Saturday.",
      "Witkoff said the president's agenda is \"to end this carnage,\" adding that the war in Ukraine \"didn't need to happen, and it doesn't need to continue.\"",
      "\"So we're on it at his direction,\" Witkoff said. \"And I think there is, you're going to see some real positive developments in the near-term future.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Trump's clash with Democratic governors. Joining us now from Albany, New York, is the governor, Kathy Hochul, good morning to you, Governor.",
      "GOV. KATHY HOCHUL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were just here in Washington and you met privately with President Trump. In the past, you've said the relationship doesn't have to be adversarial. Was your meeting with him adversarial? And what was your top message?",
      "GOV. HOCHUL: It wasn't an adversarial meeting, but I was very clear, especially after I found that the Trump administration had ended a program that was put in place, congestion pricing, by the duly elected members of our legislature representing the voice of the people, and with a tweet, he claims that he is the king, and therefore he has the power to destroy it. And I have a problem with that characterization, because we labored under a king 250 years ago, and as I said, we're not going back there. So I wanted to take my case to him directly and let him see the benefits of this program, because our city is paralyzed with gridlock, and we had a path forward to be able to make the city move again, and it's working. I wanted to just have that opportunity to convey that, but I don't know that we're very persuasive on that front, but that's okay. The people in my state need to know I'm willing to take the fight wherever I have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So just to explain for our audience, congestion pricing, you're talking about this $9 toll you put on people driving into lower Manhattan, below 60th Street. Your fellow Democrat, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, says he doesn't like this policy, actually asked President Trump to stop it. President Trump's office says this is discriminatory against working class people. How do you respond to that?",
      "GOV. HOCHUL: I respond this way with all due respect to the state of New Jersey. They do not tell us in New York what to do, nor does Washington when it comes to policies that we believe are going to reduce congestion. Move along vehicles, emergency vehicles are moving faster. Air quality is improving. So I have arguments that are important, but no one else should be able to second guess us, because that's not how our system of laws and states was set up. I'm the Governor of New York. I will deal with the internal issues before me without interference from New Jersey or indeed, the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is going to the courts.",
      "GOV. HOCHUL: Oh yes, it's going to the courts, and I believe we will be victorious in the courts, and this program will continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, this is not the only standoff between the state and federal government, and the tension here, I know you were in Washington with other governors who were meeting with the President this week. Federal funds account for about 40% of your state's budget. President Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds to governors in order to force compliance with his agenda. Here's what he said to the governor of Maine. Take a listen.",
      "[VO SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Is Maine here, the Governor of Maine?",
      "ME GOV JANET MILLS: Yeah, I'm here.",
      "PRESIDENT TRUMP: Are you not going to comply with it?",
      "ME GOV JANET MILLS: I'll comply with the state and federal law.",
      "PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well I'm -- we are the federal law. Well you better do it. You better do it. Because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was about transgender athletes on girls sports teams. Are you Democratic governors going to start to work together on this? Is there legal pushback?",
      "GOV. HOCHUL: What he is doing is they've described it as flooding the zone. They're attacking California when it comes to FEMA dollars. They're filing lawsuits in Illinois. They're going after Maine on this, and they're coming after programs that have been duly put in place in the state- What they're trying to do is create this theater of all kinds of activity that is trying to be a distraction to us. And when someone floods the zone in a football game, what you need to have is the defenders be very disciplined, smart, but also stand their ground. And that's exactly what New York governors, the governor of New York will do in cooperation with our governors. We're not going to sit idly by and let our rights be attacked. We'll work with you when there's common ground, no doubt about it, let's build great projects and infrastructure. There's areas where we're going to work with you on immigration and getting the violent criminals off our streets. We do not dispute that, but don't think that you can just come in and bully us around and not expect a reaction from governors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know that when it comes to your state, there's been a lot of focus on Manhattan and the Department of Justice because of Eric Adams and the ongoing legal issues he has. In the past week, four deputy mayors resigned. Seven federal prosecutors resigned after the Trump justice department moved to dismiss those five counts of federal corruption indictments against- against Mayor Adams. You know, the allegation is that the dismissal of the charges was in- related to a quid pro quo around immigration compliance. Did you discuss this case at all with the President when you were in the room with him one on one?",
      "GOV. HOCHUL: No, I did not. In fact, it's- we're waiting for the decision by a judge on whether he's going to accept those recommendation for a dismissal. So that's still in litigation. But I will say this, we are not allowing the Trump administration to interfere in the operations of our city, and the legal problems that the mayor is facing because of the Trump administration, and the phrasing they have used, and indeed, an interview that was done by one of his representatives on national television saying that he's basically got the mayor under his control. That's concerning, and I have to be able to put in safeguards. Of course, everyone says I had the option to remove him. I still hold that option to remove him. It is an extraordinary power. And I know there's a lot of people disappointed and angry and want something done immediately, but I will always stand on the fact that we are a nation of laws, and one individual, the governor of New York, should not use her voice and her will to override the will of the voters. We have an election in a few months for- in a primary, I'm going to let the voters decide, but I'm also going to be very cognizant. I need to keep an eye on this situation, especially the way the Trump administration has telegraphed that they want to get into our operations, and I have to be the firewall to stop that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So having said that, does that mean you do believe there was a quid pro quo understanding with Eric Adams?",
      "GOV. HOCHUL: I am going by what the perception could be. I cannot let the integrity of the administration in the city of New York be undermined by perception that the Trump administration actually created, they created this perception, the reality I will never know, but as long as there's the faith of New Yorkers that has been undermined by what the Trump administration doing is trying to give the appearance of holding the city hostage, those are what-\u00a0 that's exactly what they're trying to do. Again, they're trying to create chaos. But we have to be smart as Democrats and as leaders and parse through all this and just go do what's right. That will always be my North Star.",

      "SEN. JOHN CURTIS: It's nice to be in person. Good morning, and lots to talk about today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely, I want to get your perspective on the decision by the President on Friday to dismiss not only the Chair of the Joint Chiefs, but also five other senior military officers. The former Chair of the Joint Chiefs, General Martin Dempsey, released a statement saying trust should be based on leadership, integrity and performance to relieve a senior officer, not for a lack of one of those qualities, but for a real or perceived disagreement in their beliefs harmfully politicizes the military profession. Are you concerned, that's what's happening here?",
      "SEN. CURTIS: You know, I think we have to stop and look what happened, really, last November. And one of my colleagues described it this way. It was a stop the car moment. Those of us who have had young kids and have been on family vacations know what a stop the car moment is. It's- kids, you're so disruptive, we're stopping the car. And I think in many ways, the American people said, stop the car. We want dramatic change. We're unhappy with what's happening at the border. We're unhappy with the economy. We're unhappy with so many things. You keep promising that you're going to cut spending and you don't. Stop the car. So, people really shouldn't be surprised that this is a stop the car moment we don't get to go to Disneyland until we figure this out. And I think that's what people are seeing right now in Washington.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think part of public frustration or that there was correct to be frustration with the leadership at the Pentagon or the President's top military adviser?",
      "SEN. CURTIS: Look, we elected a commander in chief last November. This is his discretion. They want change. The people want change. We all knew what we were getting with President Trump, right? Nobody should be really surprised at these dramatic shocks to the system. The system needs a shock. And I think what you seeing as a result of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern, though, at a time of geopolitical risk, as our Pentagon correspondent was suggesting there that, you know, carrying the institutional knowledge with you through a transition, we're still the beginning of the Trump administration, certainly, that there could be a hiccup there or some complication. I mean, General Caine- is- Lieutenant General Caine is a three star. He's retired. It's not clear if he needs a congressional waiver or not to take this job because he didn't run a combatant, Combat Command. Do you know how complicated it will be to get him in place, or how long?",
      "SEN. CURTIS: Yeah, I don't, and I'm not overly worried about that. I'll come back to this. American people have asked for change. They've lost- lost confidence in so many things. They want to see dramatic change that that was a stop the car moment, and what happened at the Pentagon was a stop the car moment. Let's make some change. We've tried subtle changes. We've tried the easy changes. We've tried working around the edges, and I think the American people are saying it didn't work. Let's do something more dramatic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we've certainly seen dramatic. You had the video at the Conservative Political Action Committee of Elon Musk wielding this shiny chainsaw. It's celebrating this Department of Government Efficiency idea. Yesterday, federal employees also received an email. I'm sure you've heard telling them to reply by midnight Monday to a message with five bullet points of what they accomplished in the last week. Elon Musk tweeted, failure to do so would result in firing. Utah has 33,000 federal employees. Is that how they should be treated?",
      "SEN. CURTIS: So, listen, let's go back to 36 thousand- trillion dollars of debt, and we have to do something dramatic. Now to answer your question, I don't believe so. You know, I just published an op-ed Deseret News, Deseret.com, and I talk about my experience as mayor and having to do similar things. If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it's like, please put a dose of compassion in this. These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. We- it's a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well. We can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's- it's not just about efficiency, though. I mean, the President himself has characterized this as getting rid of bad people.",
      "SEN. CURTIS: You know, I regret that narrative. We all know thousands- millions of federal workers who are good people, who work hard. But the reality of it is, we have 3 million federal workers. Not all of them do. Many aren't coming to work. In my work- business--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Working from home, you mean?--",
      "SEN. CURTIS: -- Working from home. Let's hope they're working from home. We don't know. That's why the email. What are you doing? It's not unusual in a corporate setting to have people report and explain what they're doing, especially if they're working from home. So I don't think this is a request that is that difficult. I would ask my employees to let me know what they're doing. But I will double down on the fact of we don't need to be so cold and hard, and let's put a little compassion and, quite frankly, dignity in this as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And in that op-ed, you said sometimes it is the worst day of someone's life--",
      "SEN. CURTIS: -- It is --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- To receive a notice like this.",
      "SEN. CURTIS: Yeah, and going back to my experience as mayor, we did have to let some people go. We did a lot through attrition. But every single person we let go, I met with personally. I looked them in the eye. I told them why we had to do it. How can we then help you transition to the next thing? We can do both things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's not happening at all, right now, as you know. And at these department agencies- some of them, they're just getting locked out of systems. People don't even know who to ask. They can't ask HR, and HR says, I don't know.\u00a0 If they can get hold of them at all.",
      "SEN. CURTIS: But I'll also come back to this stop the car moment. Like this is not a normal moment. We have tried- we've tried for years to do this gracefully. We've tried for years to do this slowly, and we have failed consistently. And the American people said, enough. We're tired of this. You have to make these changes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you believe the President has the unilateral authority to cancel funds appropriated by Congress?",
      "SEN. CURTIS: Well, what we're seeing play out is this wrestle between the three branches of government. We'll find out. And this is the beauty of the system--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- You don't have a point of view?",
      "SEN. CURTIS: Well, listen, I believe in the Constitution, right? I believe this is how we test the Constitution. And people have said, oh, this is a constitutional crisis. And I say, exactly the opposite. It's proving to work. We have the courts playing it. We have Congress who will play in. We have the ability, I think we hold a lot of responsibility for what's happening right now. We could solve the budget as Congress. We could solve the border, and we haven't. And both parties, when Congress doesn't do their job in the White House, have a tendency to try to solve it. Let's let this play out by the Constitution and- and then Congress, let's step up, right? We need to- I'll be the first to say we. This is a problem the Congress is, in many cases, has given the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pushback has been relatively quiet. You're gently doing that by saying, be more compassionate. Senator Murkowski was telling constituents the other day, I can't be the only one speaking out.--",
      "SEN. CURTIS: -- So, listen--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Are Republican lawmakers going to be more forceful?",
      "SEN. CURTIS: I don't know what you want me to be more forceful on. Stop the car, like, fix this. That's what Utahns are telling me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of the congressional role here. The check being--",
      "SEN. CURTIS: -- Yeah. But I also--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- put on the executive--",
      "SEN. CURTIS: -- think that's the stop the car moment. Congress has failed in these- in these things, and the people have said, fix it. So Donald Trump is trying to fix it with the tools that he has. The courts will push back if he steps out of line. We've seen that. We know that. We saw that with President Biden as well. And that's the beauty of the system. It works. Now, it's very- it's the people back home are impatient. If you were to walk on the streets in Utah, they would say, stop the car, John. Like this is not good. You have promised. Your colleagues have promised for decades that you would fix these things, and you haven't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if the fiscal problems are fixed in the near term. Senator, it's going to be up to you, and your fellow lawmakers. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's a former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member. Welcome back, Dr Gottlieb.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen these troubling measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico, nearly 100 people sickened. It looks like most of those who have been infected were unvaccinated, and the outbreak area has one of the highest vaccination exemption rates in the state. How concerned are you though that this could spread?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Very concerned. I think this will spread. There's been 100 cases that have been identified so far. There's probably many more than that. So I think that this is going to get into the hundreds of cases, and could take many months to try to fully snuff out. And when you have that kind of a concentration of measles within a community, it's going to inevitably spread outside that community. When you look around the country, there's a lot of parts of the country, states that have relatively low vaccination rates when it comes to MMR, right now,. You look at Idaho, about 80% of children have been vaccinated for MMR. Alaska and Wisconsin are about at 84%, Minnesota 87%, states like Florida, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia, Utah, around 88% Iowa, I think, said 89% and herd immunity is achieved at a vaccination rate of between 93 and 95% and even within those states, it's not like the low vaccination rates are distributed evenly across the states. There's pockets of under vaccination. There's communities that have relatively low vaccination rates and so when you have this much virus spreading in that portion of Texas and New Mexico, I think that there's some inevitable- inevitability that you're going to see cases exported into those other states where there's low vaccination rates, and you could see a continuous spread across the country. Even at a low level, we could get some endemic spread. And the risk to the United States right now is that a virus that has been largely extinguished from circulation in the U.S. could return and just continue to spread, even at a low level, and the U.S. could be at risk of losing its measles elimination status, which would have more profound implications on things like travel advisories that could be initiated from other countries. And so beyond just the public health impact of this, which I think is quite substantial, there could be some economic impacts as well. And finally, when you look at that outbreak in- in Texas, 27% of people have been hospitalized and there's been four cases where children have contracted measles that have been vaccinated. So those are probably kids who only had one dose of the vaccine. But there's a lot of people who are at risk of this, beyond just the people who have chosen to forego the vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's terrifying, doctor and- and kids are usually vaccinated, as any parent knows, around one year old, roughly. The MMR vaccine, though- this is the vaccine against measles, is particularly scrutinized. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is now the HHS Secretary, has accused of causing issues in children. He wrote the forward to a book questioning vaccines, saying 'measles is a disease that is rarely life threatening and a vaccine that is largely unnecessary but carries real risks.' He is now the HHS Secretary, how does he restore confidence in a vaccine that he previously denigrated?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think it's going to be difficult. And as best I can tell, he hasn't spoken to this outbreak. I think you captured the essence of the argument from Mr. Kennedy, as well as people within his anti-vax movement, that they believe this vaccine isn't effective. That's not true. It's highly effective, and that measles itself isn't a bad illness. And I think there's been some statements that actually getting measles has certain long term advantages, which is just patently false. This is a very dangerous virus, and as I said, about 27% of the kids who have been infected in that West Texas outbreak and the New Mexico outbreak have been hospitalized. So this could be a quite serious illness with long term consequences. Herd immunity is achieved at 93 to 95%. We're well below that in most parts of the country. Texas actually has a high vaccination rate, and I think Texas local public health officials are doing a good job to try to get control of this outbreak, but now that it's stretched into the hundreds of cases, it's going to be very difficult. This has been a vaccine that's been studied extensively, the links between- the alleged links between MMR vaccine and autism have been the subject of some of the most- the largest studies ever undertaken. There were two studies done in Denmark, each with about 500,000 children enrolled in those studies. There were also a number of studies that were commissioned by the CDC and the NIH also looking at this in the United States. And so this is one of the most extensively studied questions, the purported link between MMR and autism. And I think the reality is, sometimes we have to accept no for an answer, that there just is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah and those studies were brought up by Dr Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, in the hearing, and Mr. Kennedy would not affirm them. Senator Cassidy still voted for him, though, but I want to ask you about another issue. Our correspondent Camilo Montoya-Galvez has learned the Trump administration is preparing plans to use a health authority known as Title 42, which you remember was used during the pandemic to restrict migrant agents- entries across the southern border. Now they want to invoke it on the basis of other diseases like TB. Is that warranted right now? Is TB that much of a problem?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I- I think from a policy standpoint, the administration has done a good job shutting down flows across the border, so I'm not sure why they're reaching for a public health measure to try to provide an additional provision, additional tool. They seem to have done a good job with the law enforcement that they're doing at the border, just from the objective standpoint of TB and the risk of TB being transported across the border. TB incidence rates are high in the countries where immigrants are coming from, but they're not exceedingly high relative to other countries. So you look at a country like Mexico, the incidence of TB is about 30 cases per 100,000 people. In Venezuela, where there's also immigrants coming from, it's about 45 per 100,000. That compares to about 10 per 100,000 in a country like England. But you look at a country like India, the incidence is about 200 per 100,000. In South Africa, it's about 500 per 100,000 so there's a lot of countries around the world where people come in from all the time, where the incidence of TB is much higher than what- what it is in the countries where people are coming across the border from. Now, you can argue that people coming in the country from South Africa or India are going through regular checkpoints where they might undergo some screening, but I think just purely from an objective public health standpoint, there's probably parts of the world where we have immigrants coming in that provide a larger risk of the transmission of TB than across the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you give us some perspective on the thousands of employees who are being dismissed from federal health agencies? Should the public be concerned?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I don't- I don't think they should be concerned. I think that there have been steps taken to try to readjudicate some of those initial dismissals, at least within the public health context. When you look across HHS, and I'm most familiar with FDA, where they're hiring back a number of employees, and I think they could hire back fully half of the employees that were initially dismissed at the FDA, and they've tried to preserve things like review functions and inspectors at FDA. They didn't do it perfectly because of the way they went about this. They riffed the probationary employees. So they did catch some employees, I think are in critical functions. They seem to be hiring them back. You know, just objectively, they look at this and they say, well, the number of people hired has gone up a lot in recent years, and they want to reduce head count, and so I think they need to be more judicious about who they target.",

      "When governors from both sides of the aisle met with Mr. Trump at a White House event Friday, the president called out Maine Gov. Janet Mills, saying that her state wouldn't get federal funding if it doesn't comply with an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women's sports teams. Mills replied, \"See you in court.\"",
      "Hochul said Mr. Trump and his administration are \"flooding the zone,\" citing disputes over FEMA recovery funds in California, lawsuits in Illinois and the confrontation with Mills.",
      "\"What they're trying to do is create this theater of all kinds of activity that is trying to be a distraction to us,\" Hochul said. \"And when someone floods the zone in a football game, what you need to have is the defenders be very disciplined, smart, but also stand their ground.\"",
      "Hochul also met\u00a0privately with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, a meeting that took place days after his administration revoked federal approval for congestion pricing in New York City.",
      "The Trump administration said last week that it would pull the approval of New York City's congestion pricing, which requires drivers entering lower Manhattan and Midtown to pay $9 tolls if they enter the areas during peak hours. Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that \"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD,\" claiming to have saved New York while he declared \"LONG LIVE THE KING!\"",
      "Hochul has pledged to push back on the move, touting the program that has been in effect since January and announcing that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had initiated legal proceedings. Hochul said Sunday that she expects the state will be victorious in the courts and that the program will continue, while also expressing opposition to the president's suggestion that he is a king.",
      "\"I have a problem with that characterization, because we labored under a king 250 years ago, and as I said, we're not going back there,\" Hochul said.",
      "Hochul's meeting with the president also came after federal prosecutors in New York filed a motion to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Amid the controversy, Hochul said in recent days that she wouldn't remove Adams from office. She said Sunday that she didn't discuss the issue during her meeting with the president, though she noted that \"we are not allowing the Trump administration to interfere in the operations of our city.\"",
      "\"I know there's a lot of people disappointed and angry and want something done immediately, but I will always stand on the fact that we are a nation of laws, and one individual, the governor of New York, should not use her voice and her will to override the will of the voters,\" Hochul added.",
      "Hochul pledged that with the way the Trump administration has \"telegraphed that they want to get into our operations,\" she must be the \"firewall to stop that.\"",

      "SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE MIDDLE EAST STEVE WITKOFF: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a lot to get to with you. I want to start on the Mideast first. You have said you are headed there this week to work on a hostage deal. I know Prime Minister Netanyahu has changed his negotiating team. Will we get to phase two of this hostage deal and can we get that American citizen, Edan Alexander, out anytime soon?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: So, I- we- we will get to stage two- or phase two, and I'm very focused on that, and I think it's going to happen. I'm going there probably Wednesday evening. I'll spend five days there as soon as I arrive, making- going to various countries, including Qatar, Egypt, Israel, UAE and Saudi Arabia. And as to Edan Alexander, he's front and center for us. I know his parents. We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home. And we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in that second phase, talking about what comes next for Gaza becomes part of that. For that day after, do Hamas leaders need to leave Gaza? Are you discussing that? And if so, where would they go?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: So, Margaret, the- the May 27 protocol agreement signed last May 27 sets forth that the phase two negotiation is much about two things, a- a permanent ceasefire, a cessation of all violence. And, in addition to that, the fact that Hamas cannot be allowed to come back into the government. And I think the way you square that circle is that Hamas has to go. They've got to leave.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Physically?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And we're going to- the negotiation will be around that- I would say physically, that's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Where would they go? Has any country offered to take them in?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I think- I think the devil is in the details, and we've had a lot of discussions around it. I'm not at liberty to have that discuss- that specific discussion today, but we've got some ideas, and that will be part of the negotiation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been quoted as saying that when you went to Gaza and you personally saw the devastation there, you couldn't understand why anyone would say- stay. But it doesn't mean you can't have some sort of right to return, if that's the policy that works for people. Does the Trump administration support Palestinians' right to return?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, Margaret, first of all, what I would say is this, President Trump is one of the most sensible human beings you're ever going to meet. He is- he understands that it makes no sense to endorse old policy prescriptions that have not worked. And what has not worked in Gaza are all of these old policy prescriptions. So, he's come up with a new notion. And the new notion is, let's create a better opportunity for these, for people who have lived in Gaza to have a better life for themselves, better upside, better aspirations for what can happen for their children and so forth. The May 27 protocol talked about Gaza as if it was a five year reconstruction plan. We've been talking in the Trump administration about a 15 year horizon, perhaps even 20 years. And now, all of a sudden, the Wall Street Journal printed an article yesterday, agreeing with that math. There is a much- level setting the facts suggest that nobody can really live there in a safe environment for probably at least 15 years. So effectively, we need- effectively people have been under this misassumption. When you're under a misassumption about facts, you're not going to make decisions correctly. We're making decisions based on a real set of facts. And so there's a lot of work that has to be done there. There's tons of demolition, there's artillery shells all over the place that could explode at any moment. This is a much longer project, and people don't belong living there right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they could return?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: That's- that's, again, goes to the devil in the details. I'm not sure that anyone has a problem with people- with people returning. We've had these discussions around that. I just think the fundamental issue today is how we get phase two done and then develop a reconstruction plan for Gaza. And for that, you've got to have a real set of facts, and we've been operating prior to the Trump administration coming in under facts that are just not accurate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about Russia. You are a very trusted advisor to President Trump, and he sent you to speak face to face with Vladimir Putin. Fox reported you sat with Putin for three and a half hours. You said that you spent a lot of time talking, developing a friendship and a relationship with Putin, and that's how you helped bring this U.S. Citizen Mark Fogel, home. Can you take us inside that room? Did you have a translator? Did you have a note taker? Were you talking in English? What happened?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: There was a translator. In fact, there were two translators. And I- to me, the assignment was trust building and speaking behalf- on behalf of my boss, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. And I had no expectation as to how long the meeting was going to last. I was intent on carrying a message from the President to President Putin. I had been advised that the President- that President Putin had something for me to transmit back to the President. And the meeting ended, I looked at my watch, and it was close to three and a half hours that we were in there and hopefully that that suggests that a lot of good things got accomplished. I think that President Trump believes- and I believe because he believes it, that trust building begins with good, proper communication. And we had really good- we just had a great discussion being President Putin, and now it will be up to President Putin and President Trump to work something out. And I think they're going to be successful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you have an intelligence officer or anyone else with you? That's an extraordinary amount of face time with Putin.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I had- it was just me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was just you. The head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund- I know you know him- Kirill Dmitriev, told Reuters that afterward they expect a number of American companies to return to Russia this year. Is he right to expect that? Did you discuss lifting U.S. sanctions off of Russia?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: We did not have that specific discussion at- at the meeting you're referring to. But, I think that- that obviously there would be an expectation that if we get to a peace deal, that you would be able to have American companies come back and do business there. And I think that everybody would believe that that would be a positive good thing to happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: After the end to the war and concessions were made by Russia?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, that's what everybody wants--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: What everybody wants- the beg- the beginning of that Margaret is- would be a- would be a temporary ceasefire. But, the long term goal would be an end to this- that we've had a- you know, close to a million and a half deaths. And so- you know, President Trump, the- his- his agenda, is to end this carnage. It just didn't belong to- it didn't need to happen, and it doesn't need to continue- not, you know, another day. So we're on it at his direction. And I think there is- you're going to see some- some real positive developments in the near term future.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Good to have you here. I want to refer back to the interview we just did with the President's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. You watched the Middle East closely. I know you were just meeting with Arab leaders when you were in Europe last week. He said that it is not realistic to have Palestinians remain in Gaza while it is rebuilt. Egypt and Jordan are working on plans for that to be possible. Does- does that proposal have any chance of surviving, or is this idea of moving them away for 15 years going to happen?",
      "MARYLAND SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, the good news in what Steve Witkoff said was that he expected us to get to phase two of the discussions. The very bad news was he did not disavow this outrageous idea that Donald Trump put on the table of cleaning out 2 million Gazans. That is ethnic cleansing by another name, and Arab countries are right now working very hard to put together a plan to show that you can deal with governance, security and reconstruction, and that you don't need to have 2 million people pushed out of Gaza in order to do it. It is tough. It will have to be done in stages, and they have identified areas in Gaza, few areas in Gaza that have not been obliterated, where you could begin to phase the reconstruction and at least get people housing, temporary housing, as you rebuild in other areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But how does that survive if the United States most powerful player is saying that's not what we want to do?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, this is a big problem, because when Trump made those statements, what he did was fueled even more the far, far right in Israel. The Ben-Gvirs, the Smotriches, who were just celebrating, because their idea all along has been to move 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza. They also want to move Palestinians out of the West Bank into places like Jordan and Egypt. So in addition to being a reprehensible idea for moral and legal reasons, it would also totally destabilize the region, which is why the Arab countries are working so furiously to put together a plan that addresses these issues and has a future horizon that provides security to both Israelis and Palestinians, and self determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are also hearing that the President is closing in on this deal with Ukraine in regard to its mineral resources that can be used for all sorts of valuable technology. What security guarantees are you comfortable with the U.S. giving to Ukraine as part of any of this?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I think this is all negotiable, but what you should not do Margaret is begin your negotiation with Putin by number one, adopting the Putin narrative, saying that Ukraine started this war, which is just a big lie, and you shouldn't begin by giving up certain key cards. So, for example, American guarantees, or a future for Ukraine in NATO. However you settle this in the end, is a matter of negotiation, but it's terrible negotiating to give up those cards right up front, as- as Trump has done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was extraordinary to hear Steve Witkoff describe his meeting with Vladimir Putin as he did for us.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I would just say that this is not \"America First\". This is America in retreat, and China and Russia and our adversaries are celebrating every moment of this as our allies are scared to death. And this is not just rhetoric. This is reality. And so\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is what you heard at Munich last week?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Yeah, well, and I think you know, European allies and others from around the world who believe in freedom and democracy, they're wondering whether this is just rhetoric or whether this is a real shift. My warning to them is, I think this is reality. I think Trump is much closer ideologically to Putin and other autocrats around the world than he is to democratic countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An extraordinary statement to digest, but I want to ask you about what's happening here at home, because you sit on some powerful committees. The administration did have some legal wins this past week. USAID, a federal judge said that they can put on administrative leave thousands of USAID employees. Another district court denied a request from unions to stop the firing of federal employees. Are Democrats too kneejerk to say that all this is unlawful?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, this is unlawful. In many of these cases, judges found that the plaintiffs did not have standing, but other parts of their opinion clearly indicated that Elon Musk did not have the authority to do what he's doing. So we just talked about the great betrayal of the Ukrainian people. What we're witnessing now is the great betrayal of the American people. Candidate Trump said he was going to lower prices right now, what he's doing is slashing important public services that help every American in order to finance a tax cut for the super rich, for Elon Musk and the billionaires.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was this email that went out yesterday to federal employees. We know that at the FBI and the State Department, management inside those agencies have told employees don't respond to the personnel email saying respond with your five bullet points. Can people working at the State Department feel safe not responding? Are they putting their jobs at risk?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I don't think so, because what we are witnessing are illegal actions by Elon Musk and a number of courts, as you know, have issued temporary restraining orders on their efforts to seize important private information, but also on their overall conduct. So what the head of management at the State Department said is, Elon Musk doesn't have the authority to require State Department employees to answer these questions. That has to happen in the chain of command\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though the President says he wants them to be more aggressive?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: So the reality is we don't- we don't know what the President meant, but as you pointed out, you've got Elon Musk taking a chainsaw to the federal government and important services, and there's no article four in the Constitution that gives Elon Musk that authority, and the way that he's been sort of quote delegated authority is there- it is illegal, and the actions he's taking are illegal, and we need to shut down this illegal operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for your insight today.",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month.

    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:21:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found the tomb of King Thutmose II \u2014 the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

    "title": "Vaccine targeting pancreatic cancer shows promise in new study",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A clinical trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center looked at the effects of a targeted mRNA vaccine on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients.",
    "story": [
      "When a routine scan led to Barbara Brigham's pancreatic cancer\u00a0diagnosis in 2020, all she could think about was how she wanted more time. Her husband had just passed away. She loved her local library job. Her three children were still growing their own families.",
      "She turned to her care team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to learn about her options. Brigham had first come to the cancer center when she was diagnosed with a small, non-cancerous cyst on her pancreas. Every year, she had a scan to make sure there were no new cysts. It was that annual scan that found the early-stage pancreatic cancer.",
      "Brigham and her youngest son went to Sloan-Kettering the next day to meet with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist who specializes in pancreatic cancer. While laying out her options to fight the cancer, he mentioned that he was running a clinical trial that he believed she would be the \"perfect candidate\" for.",
      "The trial would combine standard surgery and chemotherapy treatments \u2014 which are the standard of care for pancreatic cancer \u2014 with a customized mRNA vaccine. Each vaccine would be designed based on the patient's individual tumor. The idea was that the vaccines could hopefully help the body's immune system attack the cancer, Balachandran told CBS News.",
      "\"I looked at my son, and my son said, 'Absolutely.' So we decided to do that,\" Brigham said. \"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed. You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time.\"",
      "Helping an immune system recognize cancer",
      "The inspiration for the clinical trial came from the small handful of long-term pancreatic survivors, Balachandran said. Only about 10% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive for more than five years.",
      "About a decade ago, Balachandran and other researchers turned their attention to these \"long-term\" survivors. Multiple studies found that the long-term survivors' immune systems generated \"spontaneous immune response\" to the cancer, meaning the immune system could recognize that the cancer was a threat and react accordingly. Typically, it's \"challenging\" to teach the immune system to recognize cancer, said Balachandran, because \"the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body.\"",
      "\"This led to this question of, 'If this is what is happening in the best case scenario, could we then replicate the success in other pancreatic cancer patients?' Namely, could we teach other patients' immune systems to recognize their cancers in a very similar way as to what is happening naturally in the long-term survivors?\" Balachandran said.",
      "The phase 1 clinical trial looked at 16 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer like Brigham's. To be eligible for the trial, a patient's cancer had to only be in the pancreas and be removable with surgery. Those conditions occur in just between 20% and 25% of pancreatic cancer patients, Balachandran said, and mirrored the conditions of most long-term survivors. During surgery, a patient's tumor was removed, then sent to Sloan-Kettering's research partners at the German biotechnology company BioNTech. From the tumor, BioNTech would make the vaccine, which would be given to the patient alongside several weeks of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
      "The vaccine targeted mutations created by pancreatic cancer. As cancer cells rapidly divide in the body, they accumulate genetic errors, Balachandran said. Those errors could serve as \"red flags to the immune system,\" he said, so it became a matter of alerting the immune system to those cells and teaching it to recognize them.",
      "Sparking \"strong immune responses\"",
      "Of the 16 patients included in the trial, eight had \"strong immune responses,\" Balachandran said. The difference seemed to hinge on what kind of surgery they had to remove their pancreatic cancer: People who had their spleen removed as part of their treatment did not generate a strong immune response, Balachandran said, likely because of the important role the organ plays in immune function.",
      "Earlier data published by Balachandran showed that of the eight people who had strong immune responses, none of them had their cancer recur 18 months after treatment. On average, people whose early-stage pancreatic cancer is treated with chemotherapy and surgery see their cancer recur in a year or less.",
      "Now, new research published in Nature looked at the same patients 3.2 years after their treatment. The follow-ups found that only two of the eight patients who had a strong immune response saw their cancer return.",
      "Meanwhile, seven of the eight non-responding patients had their cancers return within that 3.2-year window, Balachandran said.",
      "While the data seems promising, Balachandran cautioned that it's \"still hard to attribute causality\" to the vaccine, especially because of the trial's small size.",
      "Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the trial, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of people who have early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy.",
      "\"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts,\" Kamath said. \"That's a very nice backbone to build off of.\"",
      "Another, larger clinical trial is now underway, Balachandran said. This randomized trial will only focus on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients with intact spleens, to confirm what role that organ plays in the process, he said. It will also help confirm if there is a link between the vaccines and better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.",
      "mRNA vaccines as cancer treatment",
      "Many other researchers are focusing on how mRNA vaccines could be used to treat cancer. Such research was underway well before the coronavirus pandemic thrust mRNA vaccination into the spotlight, said Kamath, who is working with the company Moderna on a different mRNA vaccine trial looking at pancreatic and gastric cancer.",
      "Part of what makes mRNA vaccines suitable for cancer treatment is how easily they can be customized, Kamath said. Balachandran said that it took about nine weeks for a vaccine to be made for each patient in the clinical trial. That included international shipping on both sides, he said.",
      "\"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target,\" Kamath explained. \"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease. There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful.\"",
      "Part of that research is learning which cancers are better candidates for mRNA vaccines to be used as part of the treatment, Kamath said. Things like melanoma, which causes a lot of mutations in the body, are easier to direct the immune system against. Kidney and lung cancers are other promising options, he said.",
      "Something like pancreatic cancer, which has fewer mutations, is more difficult, but has been the\u00a0subject of previous research. Balachandran said part of his goal in looking at pancreatic cancer was to see if mRNA vaccines could make a difference \"among the most challenging cancers in oncology.\"",
      "\"Hopefully this can provide some important lessons and clues and how we can do this in other cancer types,\" Balachandran said.",
      "\"Such a wondrous thing\"",
      "For Brigham, participating in the clinical trial gave her what she wanted: More time with her family and loved ones \u2014 more than four years after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On average, for people whose pancreatic cancer is caught \"before the tumor grows much or spreads,\" survival time is about three to three and a half years, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "In the past few months, Brigham celebrated several milestones. Her youngest son welcomed his first child \u2014 her eighth grandchild \u2014 in late 2024, and she recently joined her extended family for her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.",
      "Brigham has not had any recurrences since she took part in the trial. The removal of part of her pancreas did make her diabetic, because the organ produces insulin, but she says it's manageable.",
      "\"The trial was such a wondrous thing,\" Brigham said. \"It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it.\"",

    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:02:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have fluctuated since then, according to NASA and the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say the risk of it making contact with Earth is remote \u2014 with NASA giving it as high as a 3.1% chance before reducing its estimate to 0.28%, and the European agency putting it at 0.16%, down from around 2.8% \u2014 when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:43:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "Now 9 years old, Bateman is busy riding her bike and scooter around her neighborhood in Utah \u2014 and she's got her sights set on doing even more daily tasks, like cutting her own food and doing her own hair.",
      "Remi has been using a silicone prosthesis, covered by her health insurance, since she was 6 months old. While the prosthetic is helpful, it's heavy and doesn't give her the ability to move fingers.",
      "\"Her current prosthetic is pretty stationary and doesn't do a lot,\" her mother, Jami, told \"CBS Mornings.\" The hand on Remi's prosthesis was molded into a plastic fist.",
      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",

      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",

They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",

      "The iPhone 16e replaces the iPhone SE, last released in 2022, which was Apple's budget-friendly iPhone option. At $599, the starting price for the iPhone 16e is less than the $800 it costs for a standard iPhone 16, but more than the SE, which sold for $430.",
      "The new phone is powered by Apple's own cellular modem chip, called the C1, which processes the phone's AI features. The tools can summarize text and audio, create new emojis and has made Apple's virtual assistant, Siri, more capable. Apple also touted the new phone's more powerful battery and camera, compared with the now discontinued SE.",
      "Pre-ordering begins Friday for the iPhone 16e, which will be available in stores Feb. 28.",
      "\"We're so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,\" Apple Vice President Kaiann Drance said in a statement.",
      "Apple began hyping its foray into AI since last June, and has rolled out new features piecemeal. The complete set of high tech capabilities has not yet been fully released in the U.S, and the technology isn't even available in some parts in the world.",
      "Apple has been losing ground in China, one of the places where iPhone's AI technology is not yet available. It's unclear when it will be released in there.",
      "In addition to being outfitted with AI capabilities, the iPhone 16e has a 16.1-inch display screen, and no longer has the home screen button familiar to SE owners. The new iPhone 16e will include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device.",
      "Apple shares edged up to nearly $245 as of Wednesday afternoon, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.",

However, DNA analysis showed that the plant is so genetically distinct that it had to be considered a new genus.",
      "The Wooly Devil is much smaller than its sister plants, according to the researchers, ranging from less than 1 centimeter to 3-7 centimeters across. It was given the formal name Ovicula, meaning tiny sheep, and biradiata, a reference to the two ray-like petals in each flower.",

    "summary": "\"I'll live with that to my grave,\" a weeping Clint Hill told Mike Wallace on \"60 Minutes\" in 1975.",
    "story": [
      "Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained haunted by memories of the assassination, died Friday. He was 93.",
      "Hill died at home in Belvedere, California, his publisher said. A cause of death was not given.",
      "Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder's chilling home movie of the shooting, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
      "Hill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions that day but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy's death, saying he didn't react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save the president.",
      "\"If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,\" a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. \"And I'll live with that to my grave.\"",
      "It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened. Last year, CBS News correspondent Seth Doane asked Hill if he still blames himself.",
      "\"Well, maybe there was something I could have done,\" Hill said. \"I don't know anymore.\"",
      "Hill said he still hasn't completely forgiven himself.",
      "\"My dad drilled into me that when you're given an assignment to do, you do it 'till it's fully finished,\" Hill told Doane. \"I had an assignment to keep the president and Mrs. Kennedy alive. I only kept one of them alive. One died on my watch.\"",
      "First lady Jacqueline Kennedy was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza.",
      "Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump down in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine.",
      "Zapruder's film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulled himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off.",
      "Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination.",
      "The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller \"In the Line of Fire,\" about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill.",
      "Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family.",
      "Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times.",
      "\"If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,\" Hill said.",
      "\"You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?\" Wallace asked.",
      "\"The third shot, yes, sir,\" Hill said.",
      "\"And that would have been all right with you?\"",
      "\"That would have been fine with me,\" Hill responded.",
      "Hill called \"60 Minutes\" interview a \"cathartic experience\"",
      "Hill was 43 and recently retired when he did his 1975 interview with Wallace. Twenty years after that, Wallace wrote to Hill and asked for another interview. Hill wrote a letter back to Wallace.",
      "\"My interview with you on '60 Minutes' in 1975 turned into much more of an emotional experience than I thought possible,\" Hill wrote at the time. \"It did turn out to be a cathartic experience for me and helped me release feelings that had been pent up for a long time.\"",
      "In his 2005 memoir, \"Between You and Me,\" Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career.",
      "In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" where Hill credited that first \"60 Minutes\" interview with helping him finally start the healing process.",
      "\"I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he's what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,\" he said. \"It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.\"",
      "Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021.",
      "\"We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,\" McCubbin Hill said in a statement. \"We were soulmates.\"",
      "Clint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota's highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A portrait of Hill adorns a Capitol gallery of fellow honorees.",

      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",

      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",

      "Across the country in Maryland, 9-year-old Tyraun \"Taj\" Johnson was also trying to raise money for a Hero Arm. He was born with a partial left hand. His family worked hand specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine to look at surgery and different prosthesis options to give him some usage of his left hand. They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",

      "\"I would give Taj my left hand if I could,\" Kaitlin added.",
      "The family started lemonade stands to raise the money for the bionic arm. In four months, they had only made $1,500.",
      "Then they got a life-changing call from Remi's mom. The Bateman's offered to use the donations they received for Remi's arm for Taj's Hero Arm.",
      "Open Bionics helped connect the families. Samantha Payne, co-founder of Open Bionics, told CBS News clinicians spend a lot of time assisting families in appealing insurance denials.\u00a0 \"The technology is 20 years old and has been tested,\" added Payne.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland blocked the Trump administration on Monday from carrying out immigration enforcement actions at certain places of worship for Quakers, Cooperative Baptists and Sikhs, who filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's unwinding of a Biden-era memo that barred immigration arrests at certain protected locations.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang granted a request for a narrow preliminary injunction sought by the religious groups as they pursue their challenge to Mr. Trump's directive allowing federal immigration authorities to conduct enforcement actions at places of worship. Chuang's order does not block the administration's policy nationwide, and only applies to houses of worship owned or used by the challengers \u2014 the Quakers, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the Sikh Temple.",
      "The groups had argued that the new policy allowing immigration arrests at places that were previously considered protected violates their First Amendment rights and burdens the free exercise of religion under federal law.",
      "Chuang, appointed by President Barack Obama, found that the threat of enforcement action at houses of worship attended by the three religious communities has caused reductions in attendance by not only immigrants who are in the country illegally, but also by those with legal status who fear they may be mistaken for unauthorized immigrants. The court concluded that the new policy from the Trump administration likely violates the faith groups' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment.",
      "\"Where plaintiffs' communal religious exercise will be significantly and adversely affected by reductions in attendance resulting from immigration enforcement actions pursuant to the 2025 policy, armed law enforcement officers operating in or at places of worship pursuant to the 2025 policy will adversely affect the ability of Quakers and Sikhs to follow their religious beliefs or worship freely,\" Chuang wrote in a 59-page opinion.",
      "The court found that the 2025 policy imposes a substantial burden on the groups' exercise of religion in relation to their communal worship and the Cooperative Baptists' immigrant-focused services.",
      "\"Immigration enforcement actions at plaintiffs' places of worship pursuant to the 2025 policy would impose substantial pressure on plaintiffs' to modify their behavior by preventing them from worshipping with a larger and more diverse group of congregants and thereby inhibiting their exercise of central facets of their respective religions,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He said that because the new directive from the Trump administration has already caused a decline in attendance at communal worship, it \"effectively compels\" the religious groups to worship with a smaller congregation and with fewer immigrants, \"even though their beliefs call for worship with as large and diverse a community as possible.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs have thus shown that religious exercise is being hindered by the 2025 policy for entire congregations, including United States citizens and immigrants with legal status, whose ability to worship is undermined by such reduced participation,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate a 2021 memorandum from then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that barred the department and its components from taking enforcement action in certain places that \"require special protection,\" including schools, medical facilities or places of worship. That memo said immigration enforcement action should not be undertaken at houses of worship \"to the fullest extent possible.\"",
      "The court's order requires the Department of Homeland Security under Mr. Trump to abide by the terms of the 2021 memo when pursuing enforcement actions at the three faith communities' places of worship.",
      "Chuang's order does not prevent the Trump administration from conducting arrests in or near places of worship when authorized by a warrant.",
      "Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the religious groups, said they are grateful to the court for limiting the policy.",
      "\"For decades, the government has recognized that everyone \u2014 no matter their immigration status \u2014 should be able to attend houses of worship without fear of a warrantless government raid. Religious institutions should not have to go to court to fight for the right to worship and associate freely that is enshrined in our Constitution,\" she said in a statement in response to\u00a0the court's decision.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive revoking the Biden administration's memo\u00a0was issued on his first day in office as part of a series of executive actions aimed at cracking down on immigration. The Trump administration replaced it with a directive stating that \"it is not necessary\" to \"create bright line rules regarding where our immigration laws are permitted to be enforced.\"",
      "A press release from the Department of Homeland Security further stated that \"criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"",
      "The Quakers are comprised of six different meetings of the Religious Society of Friends. The Religious Society of Friends has practiced the Quaker faith in the U.S. since the 1600s, and \"yearly meetings\" are its highest organizational bodies. The group has argued that the communal aspect of its worship is key to the exercise of the Quaker faith.",
      "The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship is a network of churches, worshippers and partners that includes more than 1,400 congregations. Its congregations operate in 37 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Many congregations have a large number of immigrants as members, according to court filings, and some of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship's congregations are engaged in ministry focused on immigrants and refugees.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 12:16:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's close ties to President Trump is alienating some motorists. Wall Street analysts say that could hurt Tesla.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long been Tesla's public face, convincing consumers to pay premium prices for electric vehicles that promised to help combat climate change. But as Musk has navigated toward conservative politics and emerged as a close adviser to President Trump, some Tesla owners say they are reconsidering their loyalty to the brand.",
      "Wall Street analysts worry the Tesla brand is showing some cracks, with sales falling 1% in 2024 from the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years, even as global EV sales rose 7.3%. They also say Musk's political activities risk alienating consumers, while protests have erupted at a number of\u00a0Tesla dealerships across the U.S. over his proximity to the Trump administration.",
      "\"It would seem that potential consumers for Tesla EVs might be turning away from the company because they don't appreciate Elon Musk's close relationship to President Trump and the administration's tariff policies,\" Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the carmaker's stock has dropped 17% due to the \"visible perceived downside impact\" of Musk's involvement with the White House, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Feb. 19 research note.",
      "The inextricable link between Musk, the world's richest person, and Tesla's brand illustrates both the opportunities and risks of tying a company's fortunes to the personality of a single executive. Musk has led Tesla from its days as a scrappy startup to the world's biggest producer of EVs, growing its valuation to more than $1.2 trillion, making it one of the world's most valuable businesses.",
      "But Musk's recent\u00a0inflammatory public statements\u00a0and his role leading Mr. Trump's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, appear to be turning off some Americans. Consumers' political leanings can play into their decision to buy an electric vehicle, with Democrats three times more likely to buy an EV than Republicans, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of Musk's political activities on the automaker.",
      "Customer dissatisfaction",
      "Among the one-time Tesla fans who have had second thoughts is Minah Oh, 40, of Massachusetts, who told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's political activities led her to sell her Tesla Model X, which she had owned since 2015, in October.",
      "\"I got it because it was great for the environment, and at the time he was more on the liberal side of politics,\" Oh told CBS MoneyWatch about Musk. But, she added, she felt that Musk by last fall had become \"volatile and turned radically right.\"",
      "Oh also said she was concerned that driving a Tesla could signal to others that she's aligned with Musk's political opinions.",
      "\"I wouldn't want people to think I was a Trumper or that I am associated with Elon, because he is so tied to the brand,\" Oh said. \"I am so happy I sold it, because if I was driving it today, in the current climate I would be so embarrassed.\"",
      "Jake Nickell is another former Tesla owner who has distanced himself from the car company because of Musk's evolving reputation. An early EV fan, the Chicago-based entrepreneur bought the first of three Tesla vehicles he eventually purchased, a Roadster sportscar, in 2006.",
      "\"It was super fun to see an electric car company come up and be viable,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. He sold the car for a profit when it was no longer practical for his growing family, replacing it with a Tesla Model S and later a Model X.",
      "But Nickell said he sold the Model X in 2021 because he was unhappy with the vehicle and because of Musk's changing public persona. He replaced it with a car from rival EV maker Rivian.",
      "\"We were not happy with how [Musk] was acting on many levels. It was a slow slide. He started getting into the 'bro' startup culture of cryptocurrency at time, and there were signs that he was sliding into right-wing politics. We didn't want anything to do with that anymore,\" Nickell said of why he sold his family's Model X.",
      "Asked if he'd ever buy a Tesla again, Nickell responded, \"Absolutely not.\" He's now helping his son buy a car and is considering a Toyota Prius or an EV from Volkswagen.",
      "Musician Sheryl Crow is another former Tesla owner who recently distanced herself from the brand, writing in an Instagram\u00a0post\u00a0that she sold her vehicle because of Musk's recent political activities.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" she wrote, adding that she was donating the proceeds of the sale to NPR because the Trump administration wants to cut its federal funding.",
      "Wall Street analysts have voiced concern about the impact of Musk's reputation on the company's sales. That includes in Europe, where Tesla sales in Germany, a key market, fell roughly 60% last month, according to Reuters.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" Ives, who remains bullish on the company's prospects, said in his Feb. 19 report. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November.\"",
      "Tesla's \"net favorability rating,\" which measures consumers' perception of the brand based on survey responses, is at all-time lows, according to Stephen Gengaro, an analyst for investment advisory firm Stifel, who believes that Musk could be hurting the brand's score. Researchers asked consumers if they had a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" impression of Tesla, ranging from \"very favorable\" to \"very unfavorable,\" to determine the rating. Respondents could also reply that they'd never heard of the brand, or that they had no opinion.",
      "Tesla's favorability rating sank to 3%, a six percentage point decline, for the week ended Jan. 28, compared with 9% in January 2024, according to data from Stifel Think Tank Group, the firm's research and analysis arm. In January 2018, the company's favorability rating stood at 33%.",
      "\"[M]any on the Street view Musk spending '100% of his time' with DOGE as creating a negative perception around his Tesla focus,\" Gengaro wrote in a research note.",
      "Partisan divide",
      "More than half of Americans held a negative view of Musk, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2. Views were starkly divided based on political party, with about 7 in 10 Republicans saying they had a favorable view of him, while more than 8 in 10 Democrats said they viewed him unfavorably.",
      "Those changing perceptions may be rubbing off on car buyers, with a February Morning Consult poll finding that about 32% of U.S. buyers \"would not consider\" buying a Tesla, a five percentage point increase compared with a year earlier, according to a recent CNN report.",
      "In states that voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections, the share of repeat Tesla buyers dropped seven percentage points over the past year, falling from 72% at the end of 2023 to 65% by the fourth quarter of 2024, according to additional data provided to CNN by S&P Global Mobility. Repeat buyers in states that voted Republican barely inched higher, rising from 47.6% to 48.2% over the same period.",
      "In California, the country's largest market for electric vehicles, total driver registrations for Tesla's cars fell 11.6% percent in 2024, according to data from Experian automotive. Registrations for all other brands increased 1.4%, California New Car Dealers Association NCDA wrote in a January\u00a0report.",
      "Could Musk's ties to Trump actually help Tesla?",
      "At the same time, some on Wall Street say there are potential upsides to Musk's alliance with Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, the Trump administration may seek to weaken or eliminate federal rules governing Tesla's self-driving vehicle technology, a major initiative for Tesla.",
      "Musk has long had ambitions to launch full self-driving vehicles powered by AI. The company plans to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June, Musk\u00a0confirmed. Yet such efforts have been slowed by federal investigations into vehicle crashes involving Tesla's\u00a0\"Full Self-Driving\" system and by existing safety regulations.",
      "\"Trump's election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that's been stifling Tesla,\" Ives told the Associated Press.",
      "If the Trump administration eases regulations for self-driving cars, it would be \"a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the dip in consumer perceptions of Tesla's brand could simply be a short-term headwind, Gengaro said. And long-term, the company's development of robotaxis and self-driving vehicles could provide much more of Tesla's growth than vehicle sales to consumers, he added.",
      "Tesla's sales struggles also could be based on other issues besides Musk, including mounting competition for EVs from other automakers. And Tesla's sales decline in Germany could be due to a preference among consumers there for electric cars made by homegrown automakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.",

      "Berlin \u2014 Provisional results confirmed that mainstream conservatives led by Friedrich Merz won Germany's national election, while a far-right party surged to become the nation's second-largest.",
      "The campaign was dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe's biggest economy and pressure to curb migration, something that caused friction after Merz pushed hard in recent weeks for a tougher approach. It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States.",
      "Germany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It's been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S. It will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy.",

      "The results released by the electoral authority showed Merz's Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.",

It said he hadn't had any more respiratory crises since Saturday and that the supplemental oxygen that he was using continued but with a slightly reduced oxygen flow and concentrations.

      "To date, there's been no reference to any onset of sepsis in the medical updates provided by the Vatican.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:35:35 -0500",
    "summary": "The United States failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow's aggression.",
    "story": [
      "In a win for Ukraine as it marks\u00a0three years since Russia's full-scale invasion, the United States on Monday failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow's aggression. And the assembly approved a dueling European-backed Ukrainian resolution demanding Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine.",
      "It marks a setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. But it also shows some diminished support for Ukraine, whose resolution passed 93-18, with 65 abstentions. That's lower than previous votes, which saw over 140 nations condemn Russia's aggression.",
      "The United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favor of its proposal, according to a U.S. official and a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. They refused, and then the assembly added language to the U.S. proposal making clear that Russia invaded its smaller neighbor in violation of the U.N. Charter.",
      "The vote on the amended U.S. resolution was 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting \"yes,\" the U.S. abstaining and Russia voting \"no.\"",
      "Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its \"inherent right to self-defense\" following Russia's invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter's requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations.",
      "\"As we mark three years of this devastation \u2014 Russia's full invasion against Ukraine \u2014 we call on all nations to stand firm and to take \u2026 the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,\" she said.",
      "U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops \"have failed to stop the war,\" which \"has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.\"",
      "\"What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,\" Shea said.",
      "The dueling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the transatlantic alliance with Europe over the Trump administration's extraordinary turnaround on engagement with Moscow. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary talks last week.",
      "In escalating rhetoric, Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \"better move fast\" to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Mr. Trump was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space.\"",
      "Since then, the Trump administration not only declined to endorse Ukraine's U.N. resolution, but at the last minute proposed its own competing resolution and pressed its allies to support that version instead. It comes as Mr. Trump hosted French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington.",
      "The U.S. also wanted a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the council presidency this month, has scheduled it for Monday afternoon.",
      "The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the 15-member Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia's veto power.",
      "There are no vetoes in the assembly, and the Ukraine resolution, which is co-sponsored by all 27 members of the European Union, is almost certain to be adopted. Its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion, but the resolutions passed there are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council.",
      "Since Russia forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Assembly has approved half a dozen resolutions that have condemned Moscow's invasion and demanded the immediate pullout of Russian troops.",
      "The votes on the rival resolutions \u2014 which have sparked intense lobbying and arm-twisting, one European diplomat said \u2014 will be closely watched to see if that support has waned and to assess the backing for Mr. Trump's effort to negotiate an end to the fighting.",
      "The very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges \"the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict\" and \"implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.\" It never mentions Moscow's invasion.",
      "Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was \"a good move.\"",
      "The Ukraine's resolution, meanwhile, refers to \"the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation\" and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions \"adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.\"",
      "It singles out the assembly's demand that Russia \"immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\"",
      "It stresses that any involvement of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia's forces \"raises serious concerns regarding further escalation of this conflict.\"",
      "The resolution reaffirms the assembly's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and also \"that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.\"",
      "It calls for \"a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine\" and it reiterates \"the urgent need to end the war this year.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:09:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Friedrich Merz has vowed to prioritize European unity and the continent's security as it grapples with the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Friedrich Merz, who is on course to become post-World War II Germany's 10th chancellor after the country's election, has vowed to prioritize European unity and the continent's security as it grapples with the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "Pulling a divided Europe together won't be easy when many leaders are too preoccupied by domestic issues to devote much energy to answer the continent's most pressing problems. But expectations will be high for Merz to help fill a leadership vacuum and craft a united response to recent U.S. policy shifts that have strained the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "\"All the signals we are getting from the USA indicate that interest in Europe is clearly waning and that the willingness to get involved in Europe is decreasing,\" Merz told reporters at a press conference on Monday.",
      "\"Nevertheless, I hope that we can convince the Americans that it is in our mutual interest that we continue to have good trans-Atlantic relations.\"",
      "Merz's task will be complicated by the need to form a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He has repeatedly pledged to not work with the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party despite their second-place finish, the AfD's best result in a national election since the far-right party was founded just 12 years ago.",
      "The 69-year-old conservative leader heads the center-right Union bloc, which won Germany's national election with 28.5% of the votes.",
      "\"I am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us,\" he told supporters after his victory Sunday night. \"The world out there isn't waiting for us, and it isn't waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations.\"",
      "The top job has been late in coming for Merz, a lawyer by profession, who saw his ascent derailed by former Chancellor Angela Merkel in the early 2000s and even turned his back on active politics for several years. Despite his political experience, he is heading to the chancellery without previously having served in the federal government.",
      "Merkel has described Merz as a brilliant speaker and complimented his desire for leadership, though she acknowledged this was a problem in their relationship.",
      "\"We are almost the same age ... We grew up completely differently, which was more of an opportunity than an obstacle,\" she wrote in her memoir \"Freedom.\"",
      "\"But there was one problem, right from the start: We both wanted to be the boss,\" she said.",
      "Merkel moved to consolidate her grip on Germany's center-right after the Union narrowly lost a national election in 2002. She pushed Merz aside as leader of its parliamentary group, taking the job herself in addition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union party she already held. She went on to lead Germany from 2005 to 2021.",
      "Merz turned his back on active politics for several years after leaving the parliament in 2009.",
      "He practiced law and headed the supervisory board of investment manager BlackRock's German branch. During that break, he often travelled for business to the United States and China, though he never lived outside Germany.",
      "\"Friedrich Merz is perhaps the most international chancellor Germany has had since the war \u2014 if he becomes chancellor,\" said Volker Resing, who wrote the recently published biography \"Friedrich Merz: His Path to Power.\"",
      "Merz \"relies on personal initiative, on the freedom of the individual, on creativity and motivation. And only secondarily on the state,\" Resing said.",
      "Merz launched his political comeback after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018 and announced that she wouldn't seek a fifth term of chancellor. However, he was narrowly defeated by centrist candidates more in Merkel's mold in party leadership votes in 2018 and early 2021.",
      "Merz persisted and was elected party leader in the third attempt, after the center-right's defeat by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany's 2021 election. Merz cemented his power by also becoming the leader of the Union's parliamentary group.",
      "According to Resing, Merz's \"way of doing politics\" is not to avoid confrontation at all costs. Instead, he maintains a perspective that \"a certain amount of provocation can set off a real debate and perhaps a real development in motion.\"",
      "During the election campaign, Merz has vowed to make Germany's ailing economy strong again and curb irregular migration.",
      "With President Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Merz, who has long supported a strong trans-Atlantic relationship, said after his victory that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the United States and Russia.",
      "\"I have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\" he told supporters. \"We are under such massive pressure ... my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\"",
      "Merz will be under pressure to help solve some of Europe's most urgent problems, according to Wolfgang Merkel, a political analyst from the WBZ Berlin Social Science Center, but \"we shouldn't expect to hear one voice out of Brussels.\"",
      "\"The interests are so different within the European Union, including the political majorities, that we shouldn't expect a resounding common EU policy,\" he said and added that it will likely \"be the usual game of muddling through.\"",
      "Merz put toughening Germany's immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign after a migrant killed two people in a knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg last month.",
      "He brought a nonbinding motion before the parliament, calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. The motion was narrowly approved thanks to votes from the far-right AfD party.",
      "That prompted his opponents to accuse Merz of breaking a taboo in allegedly working with the AfD, and a public rebuke from Merkel. Critics pointed to the episode as an illustration of what they say is Merz's tendency to impulsiveness.",
      "Since then, hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest against both Merz's motion and also the rise of the far right, like the AfD, which has been placed under surveillance for suspected extremism by German intelligence.",
      "During the campaign, the AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, pledged to carry out the mass deportation of immigrants, outraging many Germans.",
      "\"We know what happened in Germany in the '30s, and it feels a bit like this is happening again, and this makes me really afraid of the future,\" one protester in Berlin said.",
      "Merz has insisted he did nothing wrong and never worked with AfD, and also repeatedly vowed to never work with the party if he becomes chancellor.",
      "Merz represents his rural region in Germany's parliament \u2014 an area where people are \"rather down-to-earth, perhaps a little reserved,\" Resing said. \"That's what shaped him: rural life.\"",
      "As a politician, Merz has always championed conservative values and stressed the importance of family.",
      "He met his wife Charlotte, who is now a judge, while he was studying law. The couple have three adult children.",
      "Merz joined the CDU in 1972 and was elected to the European Parliament in 1989. He first joined the German parliament in 1994.",
      "A pilot openly passionate about his hobby, Merz sometimes flies his own small plane from his home in the Sauerland region in western Germany to Berlin early on Monday mornings.",
      "He has stuck to flying, despite the long hours imposed by his job as opposition leader and occasional criticism that he is indulging in a rich man's hobby.",
      "\"When you talk to him about flying, his eyes light up,\" Resing said. \"He says that when you're above the clouds, that's freedom.\"",

      "Two men are on trial in Zambia on charges of practicing witchcraft and possessing charms intended to harm the country's president, in a case that has become a source of fascination in the southern African nation.",
      "The interest reflects a belief in forms of magic and supernatural phenomena that remains in parts of southern Africa \u2014 and some irritation at a colonial-era law that brands it witchcraft and criminalizes it in Zambia.",
      "\"I hate that colonial piece of legislation that attempts to outlaw a practice that it does not understand,\" said Gankhanani Moyo, a cultural heritage lecturer at the University of Zambia. He said it fails to consider the nuances of traditional African beliefs.",
      "\"Traditional Zambian societies and individuals believe in a strong relationship between the human world and the supernatural,\" Moyo said.",
      "The trial also has a heavy dose of political intrigue. Prosecutors allege the two men were hired by a brother of Emmanuel Banda \u2014 a former lawmaker who is now on the run \u2014 to curse President Hakainde Hichilema.",

      "But some politicians and other public figures in Zambia have said they believe in witchcraft, seeking out supernatural help to make them stronger or more popular.",
      "Hichilema himself was accused of using witchcraft as an opposition leader by the late President Michael Sata, who asserted that the magic from his home region was stronger. Hichilema didn't respond to that accusation more than a decade ago.",
      "A bottled chameleon, white powder and red cloth",
      "Police say the men in the current case were arrested in a hotel room in the capital, Lusaka, in December after a cleaner reported hearing strange noises. They were found in possession of a bottled chameleon and other items including a mysterious white powder, a red cloth and an unidentified animal's tail. The men also face charges of cruelty to animals.",
      "Police said one man confessed they had been hired for a curse to kill Hichilema. He testified in court they were promised more than $1 million.",
      "The case has captured attention because many Zambians take witchcraft seriously, said Enoch Ngoma, a journalist for more than 30 years who has covered many such trials.",
      "Zambia's judiciary had said it would allow this trial to be broadcast live on television, which would have been just the second time that's happened for a trial. But it reversed the decision, citing \"stakeholders.\" Zambia's influential Council of Churches had said it was opposed to a live broadcast.",
      "When the trial opened last week, the courtroom was packed.",
      "Many traditional beliefs have survived in Zambia alongside its official Christian religion. A study by the Zambia Law Development Commission, which has a mandate to reform laws, found that 79% of Zambians believed in the existence of witchcraft as of 2018.",
      "The study was conducted because the Witchcraft Act has been questioned.",
      "It was passed in 1914 when Zambia was part of the British \"sphere of influence.\" The act defines practicing witchcraft as pretending to exercise any kind of supernatural power, witchcraft, sorcery or enchantment calculated to cause fear, annoyance or injury.",
      "Witchcraft cases have been difficult to prosecute in Zambia, with evidence tricky to collect. The cases are normally heard in traditional courts, and this is a rare one to reach the magistrates court in Lusaka. The penalty for practicing witchcraft is a fine or up to two years in jail, with the possibility of hard labor.",
      "\"It is so difficult to prove witchcraft\"",
      "Meanwhile, protecting against witchcraft can be good business.",
      "Rodwell Vongo, who goes by the name Dr. Vongo, is a traditional healer and president of the Zambian Traditional Healers Association. He said he would be referred to as a witch doctor under the law but calls that term derogatory.",
      "He lives in a plush suburb of Lusaka and said he has a long list of middle-class clients, rejecting the presumption that such beliefs are only held by rural folk.",
      "The majority of his customers are women who seek charms and spells for happy marriages, he said, but many others come looking for protection against witchcraft.",
      "Wisdom Kaunda, a teacher, said he was closely following the witchcraft trial and believes it can help determine how his country treats the subject in the future.",
      "\"Personally, I feel people should be punished for planning to cause harm to someone,\" he said, but added: \"It is so difficult to prove witchcraft in the courts of law.\"",

      "Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said. One person was killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the city military administration.",
      "The attack came as leaders in Kyiv and across Europe are seeking to navigate rapid changes in U.S. foreign policy under Mr. Trump, who in a matter of days has upended years of firm support for Ukraine, leading to fears that he would join with Moscow to force a settlement to the war without involving Ukraine and its European backers.",
      "Mr. Trump's engagement with Russian officials and his agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow marked a dramatic about-face in U.S. policy.",
      "Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Mr. Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression, though U.S. officials have asserted that the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine when this week he suggested that Kyiv had started the war, and that Zelenskyy was acting as a \"dictator\" by not holding elections, despite Ukraine's prohibition on them during wartime.",

He said Ukraine's mineral resources represent \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Yermak pushed back on the notion that Ukraine had rejected U.S. proposals but said any agreement \"must meet the national interests of Ukraine, and undoubtedly, must be interesting to our partners.\"",
      "Before leaving the forum, Svyrydenko said there are $350 billion worth of minerals on Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia. This calculation, however, is partly based on geological maps dating back to 1940s and 1960s, she said, adding: \"We have to conduct geological exploration and confirm the deposits we have on paper.\"",

      "The U.K. on Sunday said it would announce new sanctions on Russia Monday, its biggest package since the early days of the war.

      "The Trump administration is rescinding a Biden-era directive protecting hospitals from investigations and signaled that beefed-up protections for medical whistleblowers would be forthcoming.",
      "The Health and Human Services Department (HHS) announced Friday it would be rescinding an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden in March 2022, which, among other things, gave hospitals the right not to comply with state-level investigations related to their provision of transgender medical treatments to minors.\u00a0Trump's directive eliminates these protections, and the rescission notice indicates that further safeguards for medical whistleblowers are anticipated in the future.",
      "\"Under the Biden regime, the door for whistleblowers was closed,\" said Dr. Eithan Haim, who was prosecuted by the Biden administration after he leaked documents to the media that revealed Texas Children's Hospital in Houston was performing transgender medical procedures on minors, even after it said it had stopped. \"It was a complete inversion of the role of HHS, the role of our legal framework, because the criminal entities were being protected and the individuals exposing criminal entities were now the ones being targeted.\"",

Several days after President Donald Trump was sworn in, the charges against Haim were dropped.",
      "Under Biden's March 2022 directive, titled, \"HHS Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming Care, Civil Rights and Patient Privacy,\" hospitals were permitted, but not required, to comply with investigations seeking information on their provision of transgender treatments. But, according to HHS's rescission notice, such guidance lacked \"adequate legal basis under federal privacy laws.\" The notice added that, \"by its own terms,\" Biden's March 2022 directive \"permits\" the release of personal health information tied to transgender procedures when it is needed to comply with other laws.",
      "TRANS STAR OF HIT HBO SERIES SAYS RENEWED PASSPORT NOW SAYS MALE AFTER TRUMP ORDER",
      "\"Covered entities should no longer rely on the rescinded 2022 OCR Notice and Guidance,\" stated HHS' rescission notice. It added that \"in consultation with the Attorney General\" the agency will also be \"expeditiously\" issuing new guidance to protect whistleblowers who take action in accordance with Trump's efforts to protect children \"from chemical and surgical mutilation.\"",
      "Haim said that under Trump's new leadership, the U.S. legal system is being restored \"to a place of equal protection under law, particularly as it relates to people who are trying to follow [Trump's] executive order, or any other federal laws.\"",
      "\"The key thing with this new directive is that, as a healthcare provider, if a hospital or other doctors are participating in misconduct, if they're lying about something, if they are intervening on patients in a way that is harmful to those patients \u2013 especially kids \u2013 as a doctor, it's not only something you should do, it's something you have to do,\" Haim pointed out.",
      "Charges against Eithan Haim were dropped last month after the Biden administration's Department of Justice sought to prosecute him for sharing information related to Texas Children's Hospital's continued provision of transgender medical care for minors, even after the hospital said it had stopped providing such procedures to comply with new state guidelines.

      "\"I've been a really strong, vocal advocate for something that Donald Trump keeps talking about, which is let the states do it,\" Gov. Mark Gordon told Fox News Digital at the National Governors Association's Winter Meeting.",
      "\"They can get things done faster. We've talked about this in energy, we've talked about it in so many other areas, education and so on. Let us run our own shops. Federalist notion, that's what our country was founded on. That's a good time to remember it, all these years later.\"",

      "\"We were frustrated to some degree by a couple of policies in some states on the coasts that were blocking our access to Asian markets, particularly for our coal, and then as the Biden administration came in, and they really shut down permitting, which, actually, this is one of the great things about one of these conventions. [Gov.] Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat from New Mexico, and I went to the White House early on to say, by shutting down energy exploration on our federal lands, you're not slowing down energy consumption,\" Gordon explained.",

We both have low methane emission, natural gas. I think Wyoming has done the best job in putting out migration corridors.

So, from my standpoint, this is an exciting time and I know my fellow governors and I are very anxious to see what we can get done in these first two years.\"",

We're a dominant energy economy, and so when oil and gas prices drop or coal prices drop, or you have a Biden administration, it's tough on our state, and that has allowed us, I think, to keep a lot of that waste out.

So I think we're seeing some of that get kind of reined back in a little bit more. \u2018Is this valuable?\u2019 which is a question we should always ask.\"",

      "Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., reacts to DOGE's revelation that millions of Americans aged 110-360 are still in the Social Security database and the department's imminent access to the IRS data retrieval system.",
      "I was one of the first to spit into a test tube, giving up my DNA forever to learn more about my health and heredity.\u00a0You know, the ones that promise to connect you with distant relatives you didn\u2019t even know existed or reveal genetic risks for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease. These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health. Even when it comes to ethnicity and ancestry, results usually rely on statistical comparisons to reference populations, which\u00a0don\u2019t necessarily yield accurate results, especially if you\u2019re from a less-studied ethnic group.",

According to an investigative journalist who tried to have her genetic footprint wiped, it was \"brutally difficult.\" Recent events, like 23andMe going bankrupt, highlight just how precarious the situation can be.",
      "Consumers are left worried about what will happen to their genetic data if a testing company is sold or acquired, especially when they have no easy way to retrieve or destroy that data. These companies often don\u2019t disclose where and how your samples are stored, either.",
      "According to Incogni, a data broker removal service, almost none of the DNA testing services it investigated provided any information more substantial than that of a \"secure facility.\" This lack of transparency about where their data is stored and how it can be destroyed creates a major roadblock for anyone trying to regain control over their genetic information.",

      "If you\u2019re still considering using a DNA service, if your genetic information has already been exposed or if you just want to take preventative steps, here are some things to do.",
      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",

From potential privacy violations to emotional surprises and the challenges of deleting your genetic data, DNA testing kits come with risks that many don\u2019t recognize upfront.

The moment someone calls you out of the blue and requires you to give or confirm any personal information. This could be the last four digits of your Social Security number, your address, which credit card company you're with \u2014 anything that concerns you, specifically. If the caller turns up the pressure and starts trying to get you to stay on the line, either by enticing you with \"rewards\" or even threatening you with dire consequences, then you can be absolutely sure the call is not legitimate.",

Older adults are particularly vulnerable.\u00a0Studies suggest that older people \u2014 who collectively lose over $28 billion to scams each year \u2014 are more likely to cling to initial impressions of trustworthiness, even when later behavior puts that trustworthiness into question. Scammers typically start their interactions with well-rehearsed, smoothly executed preambles, creating good first impressions.

The fact is, it doesn't matter if the call is legit or not. If it's a scammer, they won't be hurt or offended: rejection and hang-ups come with the territory. If it's a real call, the caller also won't be hurt or offended \u2014 here's why. Call center staff and other people who make cold calls as part of their job are aware of the privacy and security concerns that such calls bring up. They know how dangerous it can be to divulge personal information over the phone, which is why they won't ask for it. They should also be familiar with one of the best practices there is for dealing with suspicious cold calls.",
      "10 ways to safeguard against phone scams and unwanted calls",
      "1. Use the \"Hang up, look up, and call back\" method for verification: When in doubt, hang up the phone, look up the organization the caller claimed to be calling from (using its official website, for example), and call it back using the number you find there. If the call you received was above board, they'll be able to redirect you back to the initial caller.",
      "2. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: Let unknown calls go to voicemail, as legitimate callers will usually leave a message if it's important.",
      "3. Register your phone number on the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: This can help reduce telemarketing calls from legitimate businesses, but it won't stop scammers, illegal robocalls or exempt organizations (like charities and political groups) from calling you. Scammers often ignore the registry and use tactics like\u00a0number spoofing to bypass it. Want to know more about why your phone still won\u2019t stop ringing and what you can do about it?

      "5. Never give out personal information in response to unexpected calls: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive information over the phone if they've initiated the call.",
      "6. Be cautious of pressure tactics or requests for immediate action: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly or verifying their claims.",
      "7. Set a password for your voicemail account: This prevents scammers from accessing your voicemail and potentially gathering personal information.",
      "8. Be wary of caller ID\u00a0spoofing \u2014 local numbers may not be local callers: Scammers can manipulate caller ID to display any number they choose, so don't trust it blindly.",
      "9. Don't respond to questions, especially those that can be answered with \"Yes\": Scammers may record your \"Yes\" response and use it to authorize fraudulent charges or changes to your accounts.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0To get fewer of these calls in the first place, you can enlist the help of a professional data removal service. These services can take your personal information out of circulation, including the contact details spammers and scammers use to call you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "If you receive a call that gives you any doubts at all, even if you can't quite put your finger on why, then you should end the call and either go on with your day or look up the company and call it back on its official number. You can reduce the number of calls like this by signing up for a data removal service.

    "summary": "A new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Laura Ingraham asks why there are so many plane crashes on 'The Ingraham Angle.'",
      "In 2008, American Airlines became the first major U.S. carrier to charge for checked bags, introducing a $15 fee as part of a cost-cutting measure. Since then, other airlines have adopted similar fees, with prices steadily increasing over the years. Now, a new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",

      "The changing landscape of airline weight policies",
      "In 2013, Samoa Air introduced a \"fat tax\" where passengers paid based on their weight, but it didn't catch on widely.",
      "In February 2024, Finnair expanded its weight data collection initiative. The airline is now asking passengers to voluntarily weigh themselves along with their carry-on luggage at Helsinki Airport. This data collection will take place over three months, covering both short Schengen-area flights and longer-haul routes.",
      "Finnair's approach is designed to be anonymous, with only age, gender and travel class recorded alongside the weight data. The collected information will be used to update the airline's aircraft balance and loading calculations for the period from 2025 to 2030.",
      "These developments indicate a growing interest in the airline industry in exploring weight-based strategies for both operational efficiency and potential future pricing models.",
      "Researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Weight-based airline pricing divides opinion",
      "A recent\u00a0study asked 1,012 U.S. adults for their opinion on charging based on weight. It looked at three pricing options: a regular fare with a set luggage limit, a \"weight threshold\" where passengers over 160 pounds would pay extra and a \"body weight\" model where ticket prices would depend on each person\u2019s weight.",
      "The results showed that lighter passengers were more in favor of weight-based fees, while heavier passengers preferred the current system. However, almost half of the heavier respondents were still open to the idea.",
      "Younger travelers, frequent flyers and wealthier passengers were more likely to support weight-based charges.",
      "The study also revealed concerns about fairness, with nearly 60% worried about possible discrimination. Despite these worries, researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.",

      "FOOD TRACKING JUST GOT LAZY WITH THIS WEARABLE",
      "Ethical and environmental implications of weight-based airline pricing",
      "The potential implementation of weight-based airline pricing extends beyond simple economics, touching on complex environmental and social justice considerations. Climate researchers suggest that such a model could significantly reduce carbon emissions by creating a more direct correlation between passenger weight and fuel consumption. Environmental experts calculate that every additional pound on an aircraft increases fuel burn, with some estimates suggesting that a reduction of 1% in total aircraft weight could lead to approximately 0.75% fuel savings.",
      "This data provides a compelling scientific argument for weight-sensitive pricing strategies. However, the approach raises critical ethical questions about body diversity, accessibility and potential discrimination. Disability advocates argue that such pricing could disproportionately impact individuals with medical conditions or physical differences beyond their control.",
      "Emerging technologies like advanced lightweight materials and more fuel-efficient aircraft designs might ultimately provide alternative solutions to reducing aviation's carbon footprint, potentially rendering weight-based pricing unnecessary in the long term. As the debate continues, the airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience.",

      "Although there's interest in weight-based charges, societal norms and the potential for discrimination make it challenging to address. As airlines continue exploring new ways to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact, it\u2019s clear that any move toward weight-based pricing will need to carefully consider fairness and public perception.",

Hipshipper helps people ship packages to over 150 countries, offering tracking, free insurance and easy returns. The exposed shipping labels are important because they detail what's inside the packages and where they\u2019re supposed to go.",
      "However, an unprotected AWS bucket held over 14.3 million records, mainly shipping labels and customs forms. Researchers from Cybernews said,\u00a0\"Cybercriminals can use leaked data to carry out scams and phishing attacks. For example, criminals might pretend to be trusted businesses and send fake messages using specific order details to trick people into sharing personal or financial information.\"",

      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What data was leaked?",
      "Researchers believe the exposed bucket contained sensitive information about buyers, including their full names, home addresses, phone numbers and order details such as mailing dates and parcel information. While there\u2019s no direct evidence that cybercriminals accessed the exposed data, millions of malicious actors use automated bots to search the internet for similar leaks, hoping to find data they can use for harmful purposes.",
      "These criminals could exploit the leaked information to launch\u00a0scams and\u00a0phishing attacks. For instance, they might pretend to be trusted companies and send fake messages that use specific order details to pressure people into urgently verifying personal or financial information. Unfortunately, retail companies are a prime target for hackers, and relying on large, well-known firms doesn\u2019t always protect your information. Recent breaches involving companies like\u00a0Grubhub,\u00a0Mizuno and\u00a0Hot Topic show that even big-name retailers can suffer significant security lapses.",

      "7 ways you can protect yourself after a data breach like this",
      "1) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Watch out for snail mail:\u00a0While many security threats happen online, physical mail can also be a target. With home addresses exposed in data leaks, criminals may send fraudulent letters or fake invoices to trick you into providing further personal information or making payments. If you receive suspicious mail, avoid responding and report it to the company it claims to be from.",
      "3) Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won't be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports regularly: You can request free credit reports from major credit bureaus to check for any suspicious activity or unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "6) Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "7)\u00a0Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams by removing your personal information from the web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s high time every industry took cybersecurity seriously. If your business operates online, you are just as responsible for protecting customer data as a tech company, possibly even more so, since tech companies typically have stronger safeguards in place. The fact that Hipshipper left a storage bucket containing 14 million records unprotected speaks volumes about how little they prioritize cybersecurity. And it's not just Hipshipper. Many companies dealing with tech products aren\u2019t even careful enough to password-protect their critical documents. This lack of basic security highlights a worrying trend across industries.",

    "story": [
      "Data breaches keep happening, and too often they come down to companies failing to take cybersecurity seriously. Some of the biggest breaches have been caused by negligence, and now there\u2019s another major one to add to the list. Mars Hydro, a Chinese company that makes Internet of Things (IoT) devices like LED lights and hydroponics equipment, left a massive database unprotected online. As a result, 2.7 billion records were exposed to anyone who knew where to look.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips\u2014sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now",
      "Illustration of IoT devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened?",
      "Mars Hydro, a Chinese manufacturer of IoT devices, suffered a massive data breach after a publicly accessible, unprotected database containing nearly 2.7 billion records was discovered online. The 1.17-terabyte database was not password-protected or encrypted, exposing a massive amount of sensitive information related to the company\u2019s smart devices, including LED grow lights and hydroponic equipment.",
      "The database contained logging, monitoring and error records for IoT devices sold worldwide. Among the exposed data were Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs), Wi-Fi passwords, IP addresses, device ID numbers and other details linked to user devices and the Mars Pro IoT software application. Plus, internal records referenced LG-LED SOLUTIONS LIMITED, a California-registered company, as well as Spider Farmer, which produces agricultural equipment.",
      "Security researcher\u00a0Jeremiah Fowler identified the database and immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice to LG-LED SOLUTIONS and Mars Hydro. Within hours, public access to the database was restricted.",
      "It remains unclear how long the database was publicly accessible or whether any unauthorized parties accessed the data before its restriction. The only way to confirm potential access or misuse would be through an internal forensic audit, but no such investigation has been publicly disclosed.",

      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Should you be worried?",
      "The unprotected database contained highly sensitive user and device information, including SSIDs and passwords stored in plain text, which could allow unauthorized users to access home networks. Although the researcher did not indicate that any personally identifiable information was exposed, the presence of network credentials, IP addresses, device ID numbers and data about smartphones running the IoT software raises serious security concerns.",
      "The exposed credentials could theoretically enable an attacker to connect to the network, compromise other devices, intercept data or even launch targeted cyberattacks. This risk is particularly troubling, given the broader vulnerabilities within the IoT industry.",
      "According to a threat report by Palo Alto Networks, 57% of IoT devices across all industries are considered highly vulnerable, and an alarming 98% of data transmitted by these devices is unencrypted. The report further found that 83% of connected devices operate on outdated or unsupported operating systems, leaving them susceptible to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities.",
      "This incident underscores a recurring problem in the IoT sector: poor security practices, weak data protection and the absence of encryption. Without proactive security measures, such breaches will likely continue, exposing users to risks that extend beyond just their IoT devices, potentially compromising entire home or business networks.",

      "6 ways you can protect yourself",
      "If you own a Mars Hydro device or use the Mars Pro app, take the following steps to protect your data and secure your network:",
      "1) Change your Wi-Fi password: Since Wi-Fi network names and passwords were stored in plain text, the first step is to update your router password immediately.\u00a0Even if you believe your credentials were not directly exposed, it\u2019s best to assume otherwise. A strong password should be complex, combining upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using simple or easily guessable passwords, such as your name, address or basic numerical sequences.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): If your router supports\u00a0two-factor authentication, enabling it adds an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your login credentials, they would still need a secondary authentication code \u2013 typically sent via text message or an authentication app \u2013 to log in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Monitor your network for unusual activity: With Wi-Fi credentials and IP addresses exposed, attackers could attempt to access your network remotely. Checking your router\u2019s admin panel regularly to review connected devices is an important security measure. If you notice an unfamiliar device, remove it immediately and change your Wi-Fi password again.",
      "4) Keep your devices updated: IoT devices are notorious for running outdated or unsupported software, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Regularly\u00a0updating the firmware and software of your smart devices ensures that you receive the latest security patches. Check your device settings for available updates and install them as soon as they are released. Keeping your router\u2019s firmware updated is equally important, as routers are a primary target for hackers.",
      "5) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may try to exploit the data from this breach by launching phishing attacks. If you receive an email claiming to be from Mars Hydro or LG-LED SOLUTIONS, urging you to reset your password or provide personal details, be cautious. Cybercriminals often create fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Remove your exposed data from data brokers:\u00a0With 2.7 billion records exposed, your personal and network information may already be circulating among data brokers \u2013 companies that collect and sell user data, often without consent. Hackers and scammers use these databases to launch phishing attacks, identity theft scams and targeted cyber intrusions.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Companies need to do a better job of protecting user data, but at the end of the day, it is up to you to secure your own network. Updating passwords, enabling two-factor authentication and keeping an eye on your connected devices can make a big difference in keeping your data safe and your smart home secure.",

      "Criminal defense attorney Lexie Rigden joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the Bryan Kohberger defense team's argument to exclude DNA evidence from the Idaho murders case and the Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni legal battle.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: An Idaho judge has unsealed a 175-page partially redacted transcript of a closed-door hearing in which University of Idaho murder suspect Bryan Kohberger's defense team sought to undermine the credibility of investigative genetic genealogy research that helped police zero in on him in connection with a quadruple homicide.",
      "Ada County Judge Steven Hippler had previously told both the prosecution and defense to propose redactions before releasing the transcript from a Jan. 23 hearing.",
      "Taylor tried to portray the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, or IGG, as improperly left out of the probable cause affidavit used to justify several warrants in the case, including her client's arrest and multiple searches.",
      "But Moscow Police Detective Brett Payne, the leader investigator, testified that the IGG lead was merely a tip and said authorities dug up more evidence that they allege linked Kohberger to the case.",

That was it.\"",
      "Redacted information includes the identity of the surviving housemate who witnessed a man with \"bushy eyebrows\" leaving after she overheard sounds of a struggle, as well as the names of four brothers who were identified as potential relatives of Kohberger during the IGG process. The identities of the brothers and other distant relatives are subject to a prior protective order in the case.",
      "Matthew Gamette, director of the Idaho State Police Forensic Services crime lab, testified that at Othram's urging, an ISP detective reached out to one of those brothers and asked him to submit his DNA to a database that law enforcement would be allowed to search.",

      "Read the transcript here:",
      "Defense expert Dr. Leah Larkin, a genetic genealogist, testified that based on her review of discovery documents, she believes someone at the FBI violated an internal policy and the terms of service of one or more genealogy databases to come up with the lead that led to Kohberger.",
      "\"I believe we asked them to turn over the match lists, and they were like, oh, we can't turn over the whole match list because it was 20,000 people,\" she testified. \"And that, actually, right there was a big tip-off because if they had only used GEDMatch PRO and only used FamilyTreeDNA, I think at most they could have gotten to about 10,000. \u00a0So that right there tipped me off that they were in a database that they should not have been able to be in.\"",
      "Through further discovery, she said the FBI \"admitted to\" using MyHeritage and GEDMatch (without the \"PRO\"), databases law enforcement isn't supposed to search.",

      "\"We have been very clear, including last week in my briefings, that we condemn the parading of bodies and displaying of the coffins of the deceased hostages, including the Bibas family, in the manner it was done by Hamas, which is both abhorrent and appalling,\" Dujarric added.",

      "\"It\u2019s getting the Russians to stop. That's the key,\" he explained. \"The Russians are intrigued by the idea that they could make a grand bargain with this administration and eliminate the sanctions that are causing so much harm.",

      "This proposal suggests that the Ukrainian territory would remain internationally recognized as \"occupied\" by Russia, which would allow the fighting to stop, though Kyiv and its international partners would then need to attempt to renegotiate land releases at a later time.",

But as European nations look to ramp up defense on the continent without Washington\u2019s support, security experts are warning this is changing geopolitical views of the U.S. and its reliability as an ally.",

      "When asked by Fox News Digital if some of the controversial comments made by Trump, like calling Zelenskyy a dictator, claiming he has low internal approval ratings and seeming to suggest he was to blame for Russia\u2019s illegal invasion, are aiding Putin in his negotiating calculus, Hoffman said, \"I don't know what damage, if any, it's causing, but the intelligence community can assess that.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 00:44:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Dan Bongino, the conservative podcaster named deputy director of the FBI, has spent the past seven years publicly criticizing the agency he will now help run.",
    "story": [
      "Dan Bongino, the conservative podcaster named deputy director of the FBI, has spent the past seven years publicly criticizing the agency he will now help run, pushing conspiracy theories about corrupt FBI leadership and agents who were out to get President Donald Trump.",
      "A survey of Bongino\u2019s podcast transcripts by NBC News from 2017 to 2025 found that he made the FBI a regular target on his show, routinely claiming that the bureau colluded with the so-called deep state, an alleged shadowy network of entrenched federal and military operatives. Those themes figured heavily on \u201cThe Dan Bongino Show,\u201d a syndicated radio show and daily podcast that is among the most popular in the U.S.",
      "Along the way, Bongino has gone from a relatively unknown conservative pundit to one of the most followed and recognizable pro-Trump voices in all of media, commanding an audience of millions across various platforms.",
      "\u201cThe FBI has totally and completely failed America,\u201d Bongino said in a June 2024 episode of his podcast, a sentiment typical of his attacks on the bureau. \u201cIt kills me to have to tell you that you can\u2019t trust these people, you cannot.\u201d",
      "Bongino has also espoused an extreme view on the law and power, saying in May 2024: \u201cPower. That is all that matters,\u201d as part of a critique of the Biden administration\u2019s effort to forgive student loans before going on to laugh at the idea of checks and balances in the government. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s really funny.\u201d",
      "The FBI declined to comment. Bongino addressed his critics Monday on his podcast, appearing to strike a slightly more leveled tone while still implying that the FBI had been corrupted.",
      "\u201cI get it, if you are a political opponent of mine that has been involved with proudly celebrating a weaponized justice system, how you don\u2019t understand how a guy like me who discusses partisan content in an opinion show and go and do (an) unquestionably nonpartisan job,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you a simple question. Have you seen what I did before I came here?\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cI\u2019m committed to service. People play different roles in their lives. People are dads, people are soccer coaches. People are cops and military officers and military enlisted people. People are carpenters, people are plumbers. We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set.\u201d",
      "The deputy director is second-in-command of the FBI, and the job has traditionally been filled by a career agent who manages daily operations across the bureau\u2019s 55 field offices. The job, like other comparable posts, does not require approval from the Senate.",
      "But neither Bongino nor FBI Director Kash Patel have ever served in the agency they will now lead, and their public criticism of the FBI and embrace of misinformation and partisanship is raising questions about how they will run the FBI, even as they insist they are going to wipe the agency clean of politics.",
      "On Bongino\u2019s podcast from May 2017 through Monday, there were more than 21,000 mentions of \u201cFBI\u201d or \u201cdeep state,\u201d according to data from the KnowledgeFight podcast database. Mentions peaked in June 2023, the month Trump was indicted for obstruction and other crimes after federal officials accused him of hoarding classified documents. The case was dismissed after Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "Bongino wasn\u2019t always critical of the bureau; in episodes from early 2017 and before, he maintained a fairly deferential tone. But in the later months of that year, things shifted.",
      "He started discussing conspiracy theories that the Obama administration had illegally spied on Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign with the FBI, despite a lack of evidence.",
      "And by the end of Trump\u2019s first year in office, Bongino had come to a revelation, he said, claiming in a Dec. 14, 2017 episode that he believed that FBI leadership had interfered in the U.S. election by collecting information about Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign in an attempt to rig the election for Democrat Hillary Clinton. At the time, the FBI was, in fact, heavily criticized for releasing information about Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server for official public communications.",
      "He\u2019s also been one of the loudest supporters of unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen, railing often about what he said was a coordinated effort from Democratic politicians and groups to manipulate social media, voting laws, poll workers and vote-by-mail to throw the election to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Biden won in 2020; there was no widespread voter fraud, according to members of Trump\u2019s own administration. But Bongino warned that without addressing these alleged injustices, the same \u201ccabal\u201d would interfere in the 2024 election.",
      "Bongino\u2019s criticism of the FBI initially focused on top officials who he claimed were partisan. But after the FBI obtained a search warrant to recover classified documents from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home, Bongino called for larger-scale firings at the agency: \u201cEvery person involved in this has to be fired immediately,\u201d he said in an August 2022 Fox & Friends interview. \u201cAnd then when the left starts whining in the media, fire 100 more the next day. Do not even let them breathe, everyone has to go, you do not even live in a constitutional republic anymore, and there is no fixing this, there is only rebuilding it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll say for the 10th or 20th time this week, this is why the FBI must be disbanded,\u201d Bongino said on a September 2022 episode. \u201cYou understand this is going to get worse, you\u2019re not going to fix this. The organization needs to be disbanded.\u201d",
      "Bongino escalated his attacks on the FBI in 2023, characterizing the agency as a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to the United States. Bongino accused the FBI of systemic corruption, alleging that it colluded with foreign governments, spread disinformation, suppressed information related to Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden and interfered in elections.",
      "He frequently targeted then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, calling his leadership an embarrassment and suggesting that the agency had become a tool for political oppression. Bongino also claimed that the FBI actively suppressed information about COVID-19, violated the First Amendment and targeted Donald Trump and conservatives.",
      "Bongino continued to make the call to disband the FBI through 2024.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely clear how Bongino entered the running for the deputy director position.",
      "He does have law enforcement experience, having served in the U.S. Secret Service, on details for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He was also in the New York Police Department.",
      "Since then, he\u2019s been in Trump\u2019s orbit as a conservative commentator. He worked on Fox News from 2021 through 2023, and was chosen to host a radio show in the same time slot as Rush Limbaugh after his 2021 death.",
      "Bongino will be one of nearly two-dozen former Fox News personalities in Trump\u2019s administration, a list that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Trump similarly staffed his first administration with several of the network\u2019s employees.",
      "In July, conservative-leaning publication The Daily Signal published a YouTube interview with Bongino in which he said he would be open to leading the FBI \u201cif President Trump called.\u201d",
      "In November 2024, shortly after Trump\u2019s election, Bongino began lobbying on Patel\u2019s behalf to his listeners, urging them to share positive endorsements for Patel\u2019s FBI director nomination on social media.",
      "\u201cFolks, we need Kash Patel at FBI. As far as I\u2019m concerned right now, he is the only guy who knows where the bodies are buried and go in there and clean that mess up, we got to get Kash,\u201d Bongino said in a Nov. 19 episode of his podcast. Since the election, he has brought up Patel in at least 40 separate episodes.",
      "To take the position at the FBI, Bongino has to give up his microphone. Trump said in his announcement that Bongino was \u201cwilling and prepared.\u201d",
      "\u201cGreat news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!\u201d Trump said in a social media post announcing the appointment."

After being used in Clint Eastwood\u2019s 1971 directorial debut \u201cPlay Misty for Me,\u201d however, Atlantic Records released a radio version, which became a huge hit, peaking at\u00a0No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100\u00a0in 1972.",
      "In 1973, the\u00a0song won Grammys\u00a0for record and song of the year.",
      "Dozens of hits followed, including \u201cKilling Me Softly With His Song\u201d and \u201cFeel like Makin\u2019 Love\u201d \u2014 Flack\u2019s second and third No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 both of which Flack recorded with Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway.",
      "The pair recorded several songs together until Hathaway died in 1979 from a fall from a New York hotel room that was ruled a suicide.",
      "\u201cHe was very sensitive, reacting to the things around him, and whatever was inside of him. He was a genius, so he wasn\u2019t satisfied with his own performances, his own output,\u201d\u00a0Flack told The Washington Post shortly afterward.\u00a0\u201cLike many creative people, his good periods were very exuberant and his lows were extremely low.\u201d",
      "The loss hurt personally and professionally, but Flack would find a new partner, teaming up and touring with Peabo Bryson in 1980. The duo scored a hit in 1983 with \u201cTonight, I Celebrate My Love.\u201d She spent the remainder of the 1980s touring and performing, and returned to the Top Ten once more in 1991 with \u201cSet the Night to Music,\u201d a duet with Maxi Priest. In 1997, Flack released an anthology of Christmas standards simply titled, \u201cChristmas Album.\u201d",
      "Flack's music was introduced to a new generation in the '90s thanks to the Fugees. With Lauryn Hill on lead vocals, their version of \"Killing Me Softly With His Song\" topped the charts around the world in 1996.",
      "In 1999, Flack received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later that year, Flack toured in South Africa, performing for then-South African President Nelson Mandela.",
      "Flack toured well into her 70s and 80s, performing for audiences around the world.",
      "In the late 2000s, Flack founded the Roberta Flack School of Music at the Hyde Leadership Charter School in the Bronx, \u201cproviding an innovative and inspiring music education program to underprivileged students free of charge.\u201d",
      "In recent years, however, Flack struggled with health issues. She had a stroke in 2016, and was hospitalized two years later when she\u00a0felt dizziness at a Jazz Foundation of America event\u00a0in which she was due to receive an award. But she returned to the stage to sing as recently as October 2018 at a party for that same charity.",
      "To the end, Flack performed the classics that had made her a star.",
      "\u201c(It\u2019s hard to) be moved, to be moved constantly by your own songs,\u201d Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cYou need it to be in tune with them, and I don\u2019t mean in tune musically, but I mean in tune with the lyrics of the songs, with the words of the songs, and with the meaning. You need to be in tune with all of that, and that takes a little bit of doing.\u201d",
      "Musicians took to social media to bid the legend farewell.",
      "\"Rest In Peace Roberta Flack,\" American singer-songwriter Carole King posted on Bluesky, along with a picture of the artist.",
      "Actor and singer Jennifer Hudson called Flack \"one of the greatest soul singers of all time.\"",
      "\"Your legacy lives on!!!\" Hudson wrote on X, paired with a picture of Flack in her youth.",
      "Last year, Flack praised Hudson's cover of her song \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" which she had sang at opening night at The Smith Center in Las Vegas.",
      "\"Loving this smooth and powerful performance by Jennifer Hudson singing 'First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,'\" Flack wrote on X."

    "story": [
      "VANNES, France \u2014\u00a0A retired surgeon accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 people admitted in court that he committed \u201chideous\u201d acts, as France\u2019s largest ever child sexual abuse case got underway on Monday.",
      "\u201cIf I am appearing before you it\u2019s because one day, when most of these people were just children, I committed hideous acts,\u201d Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec said in a sober voice after Judge Aude Buresi, the president of a five-judge panel hearing the case, asked if he had a statement to make.",
      "Le Scouarnec, who was wearing a black coat and glasses, added that he was prepared to take responsibility for his actions \u201cand the consequences they may have had and may have for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how many victims the 74-year-old was referring to in his brief statement at the Palais de Justice in Vannes, a small town in Brittany, northwestern France.",
      "Defense lawyer Maxime Tessier told reporters outside court that Le Scouarnec, who is currently serving a 15-year sentence for the abuse of four other children, has admitted to the \u201cvast majority,\u201d of the charges but not all of them.",
      "Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, 42, who has accused the surgeon of raping her when she was just 9 years old and under anesthesia, is expected to testify against him during the trial, told NBC News she \u201cdidn\u2019t think much\u201d of Le Scouarnec\u2019s words.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really believe he is sincere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s good that they made him give this little speech. We\u2019ve always said he was silent.\u201d",
      "Sol\u00e8ne Podevin, the president of the Confronting Incest Association, also pointed out that he had acknowledges responsibility, \u201cbut not necessarily for all the acts.\u201d",
      "The trial, expected to last four months, will put a spotlight on the French medical system, which allowed him to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse that he downloaded from an internet site monitored by the FBI.",
      "Some of the victims\u2019 lawyers have said the once-respected local doctor should have been stripped of his medical privileges.",
      "Instead, Le Scouarnec, a father of three, moved on to other public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the FBI, we wouldn\u2019t have traced this back to Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec,\u201d said Francesca Satta, a lawyer for several of the victims.",
      "The trial is expected to feature hundreds of witnesses, among them Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend, both now in their 40s, who say they were assaulted in the early 1980s. Those allegations occurred too long ago to be prosecuted under French law.",
      "Much of the evidence against Le Scouarnec was carefully chronicled by the surgeon in digital diaries he kept on hard drives seized by investigators in the spring of 2017, after the mother of his 6-year-old neighbor reported that he\u00a0had raped the girl after luring her across a mesh fence in their gardens, prosecutors said.",
      "After his arrest, Le Scouarnec told investigators during several interrogations that he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began recording them in diaries, according to an outline of the case by the investigating judge.",
      "Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the court documents show.",
      "When investigators searched Le Scouarnec\u2019s house in May 2017, they found thousands of child pornography images as well as\u00a0 photos of the doctor performing sex acts on dolls and animals, according to a report by the investigating judge. Around\u00a05,000 videos of a \u201cviolent nature\u201d were also found, some showing acts of torture, the report said.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of raping the young neighbor and three others when they were children. He is currently serving 15 years in prison. He faces an additional 20 years if convicted of the latest charges \u2014 a sentence that lawyers say would run concurrently.",
      "The average age of the alleged 158 male and 141 female victims in the current trial is 11. The majority \u2014 256 \u2014 were under the age 15 at the time they were assaulted, most of them under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors allege.",
      "Court officials say they struggled to find venues large enough to stage the trial, which is expected to cost \u20ac3 million ($3.14 million). In the end, they decided to broadcast the trial in a former university building, around five minutes\u2019 walk from the courthouse in the center of Vannes, a Breton town with medieval ramparts, canals and a port dotted with sailboats.",
      "Victims and their families will be watching the trial on a screen in a 450-seat auditorium.",
      "The more than 450 journalists who have been accredited to cover the trial can watch a live feed in another part of the building, away from the victims. Testimony will play out in the main courthouse, with around 60 lawyers cycling through before the trial wraps up in mid-June.",
      "For many victims, that distance from their abuser was the latest blow in a process which has often made them feel sidelined, said lawyer Marie Grimaud, who is representing 37 of them.",
      "\u201cEverything is conspiring to make us invisible and to keep us at a distance, as if we were only second-rate players in this trial,\u201d reads an open letter Grimaud released on behalf of her clients.",
      "But L\u00e9v\u00eaque, who learned about her alleged rape from investigators, said she preferred to stay far away from the doctor.",
      "\u201cI feel protected.\u201d she said."

      "A Nebraska man is fighting to get a Social Security number and valid birth certificate for his toddler, Caroline \u2014 whose name is incorrectly listed in state records as \u201cUnakite Thirteen Hotel.\u201d",
      "Jason Kilburn, who lives outside of Omaha, has been desperately trying to obtain a Social Security card and a useable birth certificate for Caroline. Without these documents, he said, he has been unable to get any services for her, from health insurance to child care, because they all require a Social Security number to verify her identity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s a ghost,\u201d Kilburn said in a phone interview Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been very, very taxing.\u201d",
      "Caroline was born in November 2022 in a house just over the state border in Council Bluffs, Iowa, to a mother who immediately handed her over to a Nebraska foster family, Kilburn said. He and Caroline\u2019s mother had dated on and off for several years but were not together when she gave birth, he said, and it was only later that he learned of Caroline\u2019s arrival.",
      "Once Kilburn took a DNA test proving he was the girl\u2019s father, the juvenile court relinquished custody from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees foster care, to him. The mother, who faces allegations of neglect and drug problems, has no custody rights, an attorney for Kilburn said. Attempts to reach Caroline\u2019s birth mother on Monday were unsuccessful.",
      "As Kilburn tried to gather basic paperwork for his daughter once she was in his custody, he quickly realized that something was wrong: In the exchange between Caroline\u2019s birth mother in Iowa and the foster family in Nebraska, instead of a birth certificate, the girl had received only a certificate of live birth \u2014 an unofficial document that hospitals submit to start the process of generating government-issued birth certificates.",
      "Further complicating the matter, the certificate of live birth listed a bizarre name on it: Unakite Thirteen Hotel.",
      "Kilburn said he contacted CHI Health Mercy Council Bluffs, the hospital that issued the document, and received little guidance on how to proceed. But he did get a potential explanation for where the name on the document came from.",
      "\u201cI was told it was a computer-generated name,\u201d he said.",
      "Kilburn then learned that his daughter did not have a Social Security number. He is now working with Joshua Livingston, an attorney at the Koenig | Dunne law firm in Omaha, to try to push the state of Nebraska to resolve the matter. Livingston called the quagmire \u201ca circuitous, bureaucratic loop.\u201d",
      "Neither CHI Health Mercy Council Bluffs nor the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services immediately replied to a request for comment Monday. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said information about children in state custody is confidential.",
      "\u201cDHHS is working with the child\u2019s father\u2019s attorney to resolve this issue. The Department cannot go into any further detail,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email.",
      "\u201cEach state is responsible for all vital events that happen within the state including births and deaths as well as the registration of the event, the certificate, and any amendments or corrections needed,\u201d the statement added.",
      "In an email to NBC News on Monday afternoon, the Social Security Administration indicated it was looking into the case.",
      "\u201cPrivacy laws preclude Social Security from discussing the specifics of an individual\u2019s case.\u00a0 However, we can share that the agency is reaching out to Mr. Kilburn directly,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
      "But as of Monday evening, Kilburn had not yet been contacted by the Social Security Administration.",
      "There have been attempts to help Caroline get what she needs. In March 2023, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services filed a motion in juvenile court in Douglas County, Nebraska, seeking a court order \u201callowing NDHHS to establish a legal name for the above-named minor child as Unakite Thirteen Hotel\u201d so it could temporarily use her incorrect name to get an official birth certificate that it planned to use to get her a Social Security number.",
      "The court granted the motion, and Livingston said the Nebraska DHHS received a birth certificate listing Unakite Hotel as the child\u2019s name that said \u201cfor government use only.\u201d But the agency never followed through with getting her a Social Security number, he said. Livingston filed a motion in December 2024 seeking to reopen the matter, which the court denied.",
      "He said the Nebraska DHHS recently contacted him to say they were in touch with a counterpart in Iowa to work on the issue, but he has not received any updates. He is planning to file a motion in the coming days to ask the court if the birth certificate that said \u201cfor government use only\u201d can be amended so it has Kilburn\u2019s name on it, which should enable him to use the birth certificate to apply for a Social Security number himself.",
      "In the meantime, the legal limbo has put Kilburn and Caroline in a precarious position.",
      "He\u2019s currently not working due to a heart problem and was denied Medicaid and other services for Caroline because he could not provide a Social Security number for her. A simple check-up for Caroline at the pediatrician\u2019s office recently cost Kilburn about $700, he said, making him hesitant about going to other doctor\u2019s visits.",
      "\u201cThree or four weeks ago, she was sick. She had a fever and she was throwing up, and I had to weigh my options about what I was going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really sucks to sit here and watch her suffer when there\u2019s health care out there that I can\u2019t get because of this.\u201d",
      "He also is unable to enroll Caroline in day care, speech therapy, or other early intervention services that he feels she may qualify for.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to pull something here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is stuff she\u2019s entitled to as any American is.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said that Caroline \u2014 whose full name, once he can get an actual birth certificate, will be Caroline Elizabeth Kilburn \u2014 is doing well overall.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a joy to be around,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t show signs of any trauma from any of this.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Apple on Monday reaffirmed a commitment to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. over the coming years amid pressure from President Donald Trump and the growing threat of his tariffs",
      "The tech giant said it planned to spend $500 billion over the next five years in the United States, with intentions to hire 20,000 new workers and produce AI servers.",
      "The plans include a server factory in Houston slated to open in 2026 and a manufacturing academy in Detroit. The company also said data centers in Arizona, California, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington would see expansions from the investment plans.",
      "Monday's move is Apple's latest splashy announcement about investing in the United States, making it an acceleration of existing plans.",
      "The company announced in 2021 that it was planning to invest $430 billion domestically over the next five years. In 2018, during Trump's first term, Apple said it would make a $350 billion \"contribution\" to the American economy over a stretch of five years, including the creation of 20,000 jobs.",
      "Apple also confirmed Monday that an Arizona-based Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. facility, which began development under the Biden administration, had started producing chips for it there \u2014 news that media had previously reported.",
      "Trump sought to take credit for the latest announcement \u2014 and seemed to tip it last week shortly after meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook and implied the trade duties he has threatened on a host of imports played a role.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be in the tariffs,\u201d Trump said last week, adding that Cook had halted plans to build two facilities in Mexico, an assertion Apple has not confirmed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Monday, Trump cited \"faith in what we are doing\" as the reason for Apple's announcement.",
      "In a note to investors, analysts at UBS cast some doubt about whether Apple can actually deploy $500 billion in the U.S. in the time frame it laid out, citing the company's overwhelming reliance on suppliers outside the U.S. and the fact that it has historically lagged other large tech firms in making large capital expenditures.",
      "\"While the headline figure on the surface is a large number, we believe it lacks substance at this juncture based on history,\u201d the analysts wrote.",
      "Apple's playbook for avoiding tariffs appears to track closely with its strategy during the first Trump administration, when it allowed the president to take credit for a plant that had been making Mac computers in Texas for at least three years before he took office. Like other products Apple makes in the United States or says it intends to, the Mac made in Texas is not one of its mainstream models. Apple's key revenue-generating products like the iPhone are all still manufactured outside of the country.",
      "Apple and Cook have also gone a step further in Trump's second term, both donating to Trump's inauguration fund. Cook attended Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Capitol Hill.",
      "Apple said the new jobs it plans to hire for will be primarily related to research and development, engineering and AI. It also said it plans to expand investment in an existing advanced manufacturing fund.",
      "\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d Cook said in a statement. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\u201d",
      "Apple shares were little changed in early Monday trading."

    "summary": "Germany woke Monday after an election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes but far-right nationalists surged to huge gains causing dismay.",
    "story": [
      "BERLIN \u2014 Germany woke Monday to the aftermath of a bruising election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes and far-right nationalists surged to huge gains, causing dismay in a country deeply wary of its Nazi past.",
      "The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is under surveillance by German intelligence over suspected far-right extremism, experienced its largest-ever share of the vote, garnering the support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump administration.",
      "The White House\u2019s alleged interference in the run-up to the vote sparked unusually fierce criticism from Friedrich Merz, the leader of the victorious Christian Democratic Union, who will lead coalition talks to form Germany's next government.",
      "Merz told supporters at a party event in Berlin on Sunday night: \u201cI have no illusions at all about what is happening from America. Take a look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "If Merz, who said Monday that he plans to quickly form Germany's next government, does become the next chancellor, then his in tray will be bursting.",
      "Domestically, he would have to deal with widespread unrest over immigration at home, fueled by a spate of high-profile attacks in recent weeks and a flagging economy. That might be harder after the AfD and the radical Left Party won enough seats to block\u00a0constitutional changes needed to loosen state borrowing limits \u2014 changes economists say are essential to reviving growth.",
      "Internationally, Merz would have to navigate the fraying bond between Washington and Europe, of which Germany is the most populous country and biggest economy. There is also the matter of the war in Ukraine, over which the AfD and radical Left's sway may also stymie raising Germany's defense and military aid budget.",
      "All the while, Merz would have one eye on the far right, which has been surging across Europe while enjoying mutual support from President Donald Trump and his aides.",
      "Musk has previously endorsed the AfD, hosting party events on the X social media platform that he owns and appearing at a campaign rally during which he repeated one of the party\u2019s most controversial points of view, which is that young Germans should no longer feel guilty for the events of the Holocaust in their country\u2019s past.",
      "Merz said Sunday that \u201cthe interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. So we are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\u201d",
      "By design, Germany\u2019s voting system means it is very difficult for one party to govern alone, forcing leaders to work together and form coalitions to govern this consensus-based country. Merz said that he hoped to form a government by Easter, but added that cooperating with the second-placed AfD was \u201ccompletely out of the question.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s political establishment has long maintained an informal \u201cfirewall\u201d against cooperating with the far right that is seen as a bulwark against fascism.",
      "Merz\u2019s CDU party won 28.5% of the vote and 208 of the 630 seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, according to results that are set to be validated by lawmakers March 15.",
      "The AfD won 20.5% and 152 seats, while the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party fell to 15.5% and 120 seats. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been effectively voted out of office, calling the interventions by Washington \u201cdisgusting\u201d Sunday.",
      "The environmentally focused Greens got 11.6% and 85 seats, and the leftist Die Linke party received 8.8% and 64 seats, while the pro-business Free Democrats and left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance failed to meet the 5% threshold that would allow them to enter parliament."

      "A woman may have signed her name on the world's oldest dated runestone, researchers in Norway have found, as they piece together the 2,000-year-old puzzle.",
      "The inscription begins with the word \u201cI\u201d in runic script, followed by the name of the writer and a verb that indicates writing, before ending with the word \u201crune,\u201d researchers wrote earlier this month in the journal Antiquity after studying a fragment of the stone found at a grave site in Hole, a small municipality in southern Norway to the east of the capital, Oslo.",
      "\u201cBasically the text would be saying, I, the rune inscriber\u2019s name, wrote the runic inscription,\u201d one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Kristel Zilmer, told NBC News in telephone interview Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a type of inscription also that has parallels in some other romantic inscriptions, basically somebody telling us that they made this inscription,\u201d added Zilmer, a professor of runology at the University of Oslo\u2019s Museum of Cultural History.",
      "The researchers said they believed the Germanic alphabetic script was inspired by the Roman alphabet, of which runes formed the foundational blocks in the first A.D. centuries. It was widely used in Scandinavia up until the late Middle Ages.",
      "Runic inscriptions have been found on objects such as a bone knife and iron knife from Denmark and a comb, which archeologists have dated to around 150 A.D. Those found on other runestones date to around 700 A.D.",
      "Often they bore messages, including spells to bring back the dead and charm words.",
      "But very little is known about their development as it varied over time and deciphering them can be challenging without archaeological context.",
      "The latest research suggests the fragments, the first of which was discovered in 2021, were part of a single slab. The discovery also brings scientists one step closer to understanding the language\u2019s evolution and the use of such stones, the researchers said.",
      "Two years later, researchers found more fragments and the script on them appeared to continue across the fragments, indicating they were all part of a single stone.",
      "\u201cThey managed to find two extra pieces, and they fit perfectly within the middle part of one of the inscriptions, and gave us almost a complete inscription,\u201d Zilmer said.",
      "Due to the damage and the weathering of the stone, she added that determining the exact text, including the name of the inscriber, is a \u201cbit tricky,\u201d but what especially caught the attention of the researchers is a feature in the name that indicates it ended with a \u201c-u.\u201d",
      "In ancient runic script, she said that would indicate a possible woman\u2019s name which, if confirmed, \u201cwould be the earliest known record of a female rune-inscriber.\u201d",
      "Because the fragments found in Hole were buried along with cremated human remains, scientists had the crucial archeological context that allowed them to use radiocarbon dating to confirm the fragments dated between 50 B.C. and 275 A.D.",
      "\u201cWe may have here a series of events unfolding involving different people,\u201d Zilmer said. \u201cIt may be a stone that combines different purposes.\u201d",
      "While much of the research is still ongoing, \u201cwe are still missing significant portions, so there are evident gaps,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle with holes, but nonetheless it will be very interesting to see how far we can get, how many of these small fragments, some of these also inscribed, that might be able to connect to each other,\u201d she added."

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 02:49:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., said he planned to use a previously scheduled meeting at the White House on Tuesday to \"bend\" President Trump's ear on the issue.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After facing blowback from constituents, several House Republicans are returning to Washington this week on a mission to demand both more information and a more considerate approach from the Elon Musk-led effort to downsize the federal government.",
      "Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., who was confronted during a testy town hall in his deep red district last week, said he plans to reach out to Musk and urge him to show more compassion amid the Department of Government Efficiency's execution of federal budget cuts and layoffs.",
      "McCormick also said he wants to use a previously scheduled meeting at the White House on Tuesday to \u201cbend\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s ear on the issue. The entire House Republican sophomore class is meeting with Trump on Tuesday, according to McCormick.",
      "\u201cIf we have layoffs at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], some people are going to be affected. The question is, do we give people time to adjust to their lives? And I think that\u2019s my biggest concern, is that we\u2019re being compassionate,\u201d McCormick told NBC News.",
      "\u201cIronically, the first time I ever met Elon Musk, he was asked, \u2018What could Republicans do better?\u2019 And his response was \u2026 \u2018I think you guys could come across as more compassionate.\u2019 So I\u2019m going to use his own words when I talk to him,\u201d McCormick said.",
      "As Republicans have started to feel the heat from constituents who are impacted by the cuts and layoffs, some lawmakers have spoken out more publicly about DOGE and encouraged the Trump administration to take a more delicate approach. While they want to remain loyal to Trump, they also want to protect the voters who elected them to Congress.",
      "Adding to the frustration: Congressional Republicans have been given little heads-up about DOGE\u2019s moves, let alone given any sort of messaging guidance, which has at times left them flat-footed.",
      "Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., whose voters demanded answers about DOGE's cost-cutting effort during a town hall last week, said he promised his constituents that he would try to get more information from the Trump administration about exactly what is being cut and who would be impacted.",
      "\u201cIt would be better, I think, for members to have real specific information. Because we don\u2019t have it. I don\u2019t have it,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking at, and we don\u2019t know what the numbers are. \u2026 I\u2019m learning about this when I see a broadcast as much as anyone else right now, because we haven\u2019t been briefed on it.\u201d",
      "But other House Republicans brushed aside concerns about the contentious town halls.",
      "Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., who faced tough questions\u00a0about federal budget cuts during an event in his district last week, said his constituents are still supportive of DOGE's broader mission, but have an issue with Musk.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve not heard anyone say they don\u2019t want to cut anything. It\u2019s just that they don\u2019t like Elon. That it\u2019s,\u201d Hern told NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019re moving forward with the cuts.\u201d",
      "Hern added that he\u2019s \u201csticking\u201d with his support of DOGE, despite the concerns from some of his constituents, but will continue to hear them out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to move forward. We\u2019ll continue to answer questions. I took questions for over an hour from my constituents back home last week, and y\u2019all listen, we represent everybody. I\u2019m gonna take questions,\u201d Hern said. \u201cBut I still think the right thing to do is to get our government under control. We\u2019re $37 trillion in debt and growing. It\u2019s not gonna get better if we keep doing same thing the same way we\u2019ve always done it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., said that he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the crowded event he had with constituents Monday morning in Missouri where voters expressed concerns about federal workers losing their jobs and actions by DOGE.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate thing was, is that this was organized protests, I think from some outside agitator groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were some constituents there who I wanted to hear from, and I could not hear from them.\u201d",
      "Alford said that his \u201cdistrict is firmly behind what President Trump is doing and what DOGE is doing.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged \u201cvalid concerns about the speed that this is happening. But the ship heading towards a reef, we don\u2019t have much time before we hit that reef with $36 trillion worth of debt.\u201d"

      "The \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d star posed on the red carpet in the svelte velvet black gown that featured a stunning gold neckline and elegant black gloves. She styled the look with an auburn bob and bright red lip. Later in the evening, she continued to show off the gown when she presented an award alongside Colman Domingo.",

But Sunday night, Curtis opted for a sequined and feathered black gown. The Oscar-winner took the stage to present an award, as well.",

      "For the podcast\u2019s Feb. 24 episode, Fishel, Rider Strong and Will Friedle brought Ward on as the show\u2019s latest guest. Ward joined the cast of \u201cBoy Meets World\u201d as Rachel McGuire in 1998 during the show\u2019s sixth season as a student who becomes a roommate to Eric Matthews (Friedle) and Jack Hunter (Matthew Lawrence). At the top of the episode, the former cast members spoke about how she has since become an adult film star and a model for OnlyFans.",
      "However, it was Fishel\u2019s direct question to Ward, part way into the episode, that set the tone for the rest of the conversation: \u201cDo you hate us?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate you,\u201d Ward replied, not mincing words. \u201cThere\u2019s some beef between us. And maybe I picked up the wrong signals, but definitely, there was some sort of weirdness there.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so what did you think it was?\u201d Fishel confronted.",
      "The conversation escalated when Ward suggested that Fishel harbored jealous feelings towards her when they reunited years later for \u201cGirl Meets World,\u201d the Disney Channel sequel to \u201cBoy Meets World.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the fact that I was getting a lot of attention at that time and going off in my own space and taking away, like that attention,\u201d Ward replied, a claim Fishel swiftly shut down.",
      "\u201cI was on the cover of Maxim in 2014,\u201d she countered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in any way upset.\u201d",
      "While talking over one another, the two actors hashed out lingering grievances, including Ward\u2019s claim that Fishel had unfriended her on Facebook and Fishel\u2019s accusation that Ward was seeking attention on the podcast. The more they dug in, the more the unease grew, with Fishel accusing Ward of speaking regularly and critically to TMZ about the podcast.",
      "\u201cIt seems like almost any time the podcast is in the news, in the press, there\u2019s a quickly followed-up TMZ interview with you,\u201d Fishel replied. \u201cHow do those happen, by the way?\u201d",
      "\u201cThey come and get me; they find me on the streets,\u201d Ward replied. \u201cAre you trying to accuse me of something?\u201d",
      "\u201cI was just curious because it seems as though every time we\u2019ve been in the news, shortly thereafter, there\u2019s an interview with you on TMZ,\u201d Fishel replied.",
      "When Fishel continued asking about her TMZ interviews, Ward replied, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why this is like a grilling session right now?\u201d",
      "More friction arose when Ward addressed the group, saying, \u201cI think there\u2019s a divide too because you guys hate Ben (Savage), and you guys hate (\u2018Boy Meets World\u2019 creator) Michael (Jacobs).\u201d",
      "\u201cBen is one of the most important people I\u2019ve ever met in my life, and I can\u2019t stand the fact that he won\u2019t speak to us,\u201d Friedle cut in, later adding, \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it is: He won\u2019t speak to us.\u201d",
      "When Ward accused Fishel of inviting her on the show for rating, Fishel, in turn, replied, \u201cI\u2019m not the one who wanted to go after ratings.\u201d",
      "At one point, Ward's connection was lost and exited the interview. A producer asked Friedle to text her and make sure it wasn't intentional and shortly after, Ward logged back on.",
      "By the end, the podcasters and Ward wrapped up with a friendly to tepid farewell, with the hosts suggesting that Ward join them again.",
      "\u201cThank you for joining us, Maitland,\u201d Fishel said. \u201cIt was nice to talk to you. Share some good times, share not-so-good times.\u201d",
      "Ward signed off, replying, \u201cThanks.\u201d",
      "Still, when Ward was gone, and only the three hosts remained for a\u00a0recap, Friedle replied, \u201cI don\u2019t like when things are tense.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know,\u201d Fishel replied, before saying again that Ward was using the conflict as an opportunity for publicity.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hate Maitland, not even the slightest,\u201d she concluded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have her back (on the podcast). Does that mean that Maitland and I need to have each other\u2019s numbers and send each other texts? Absolutely not. We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t need that, and that\u2019s OK.\u201d"

I retired for 15 years, and then I came back at 65, which is not usual. And I made one of my most successful movies in my 80s.

We have to know, for example, if a young woman is cutting, or she's a sex worker, there's a good chance that as a young girl she was sexually abused or incested. I'm thinking Bree Daniels in \"Klute.\" And I'm sure many of you guys have played bullies and misogynists, and you can pretty much know, you actors, right, that probably their father bullied them and called men that he felt were weak, he called them losers or pussies.",

      "I made my first movie in 1958. It was the tail end of McCarthyism, when so many careers were destroyed. Today it's helpful to remember, though, that Hollywood resisted. We did.

      "\"FYRE 2 is real. My dream is finally becoming a reality,\" Billy McFarland, the founder of the controversial festival, told TODAY in an interview that aired Feb. 24.",
      "Unlike the original iteration of the festival, McFarland will not handle details, with a festival operator signing on to do that, while hotel, travel and ticketing companies were also brought on.",
      "\"FYRE 2 really isn\u2019t about the past, and it\u2019s not really about me. It\u2019s about taking the vision, which is strong,\" McFarland said.",
      "No artists have been announced as taking part in the event yet.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to have artists across electronic, hip hop, pop and rock,\" McFarland said. \"However, it\u2019s not just music. We might have a professional skateboarder do a demonstration. We might have an MMA champion teach you techniques in the morning.\"",

      "The original Fyre Festival was rife with controversy. The festival was billed as a luxury music experience but the actual event included no concert and poor conditions. In 2018, McFarland pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges related to the event and was sentenced to a combined six years in prison, NBC News reported.",
      "While the first festival gained infamy, McFarland said the second one also comes with \"risk.\"",

      "\u201cSince 2016 Fyre has been the most talked about music festival in the world,\u201d he explained. \u201cObviously, a lot of that has been negative, but I think that most people, once they kind of get under the hood and study the plans and see the team behind Fyre II, they see the upside... And if it\u2019s done well, I think Fyre has a chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what McFarland has said so far about Fyre Festival 2.",

      "In his 2024 interview, he didn\u2019t confirm the name of the island but said that the festival would use existing infrastructure for eateries, lodging and restrooms.",
      "All logistics would be handled by the production company, with McFarland adding, \u201cBut we are developing and building out the private island for the actual festival festivities.\u201d",
      "How to get Fyre Fest II tickets",
      "A total of 2,000 tickets will go on sale beginning Feb. 24. They range in price from $1,400 to $1.1 million. McFarland says customers can get yacht accommodations and access to artists who will be performing.",
      "Ticket information can be found on a dedicated Fyre Fest 2 website here.",
      "McFarland previously shared that he had already sold 100 tickets at $500 each. He also said that other packages would be on sale, ranging in price from $1,400 to $1.1 million.",
      "For that million dollar price package, McFarland said, \u201cYou will be on a boat, have the luxury yachts that we partner with who will be docked and parked outside the island.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut once again, Fyre is not just about this, like, luxury experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the adventure. So you\u2019ll be scuba diving with me. You\u2019ll be bouncing around to other islands and other countries on small planes.\u201d",
      "What happened at the original Fyre Fest?",
      "While Fyre Festival was marketed as a luxury, \u201conce-in-a-lifetime musical experience\u201d on a private island, what attendees got was a far cry from what they had been promised.",
      "NBC News reported that festival goers, with some paying $250,000 for premium tickets, were met with less-than-ideal circumstances, including boxed meals such as the infamous cheese sandwiches, inadequate security and low-grade sleeping tents.",
      "Many of the headlining acts, including Blink-182, canceled their appearances at the festival before the weekend even kicked off.",
      "Fyre Festival was ultimately postponed due to \u201cunforeseen and extenuating circumstances,\u201d with McFarland telling Rolling Stone, \u201cWe were a little na\u00efve in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves.\u201d",
      "In March 2018, McFarland pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges tied to the festival, NBC News reported. Months later in July, he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges from a separate incident after he made $150,000 in fake ticket sales to different events. McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison on fraud charges in October 2018.",
      "A minimum of $500,000 from the festival will go toward the $26 million in restitution McFarland still owes. He and all his partners have also committed to 10 percent of total profits going toward that, as well. They also expect to sell out within a day, based on interest they have seen on their site.",
      "McFarland was released from prison in May 2022, more than two years before the end of his sentence, after earning good time credit, his lawyer, Jason Russo, told NBC News at the time."

Damon Wayans Sr. revealed in this 2025 NAACP Image Award acceptance speech that Keenen Ivory Wayans locked himself in his bedroom for two weeks while he came up with the idea for the film.",
      "The success of both films helped pave the way for Keenen's influential sketch TV series, \u201cIn Living Color,\u201d which became a home for multiple siblings over the years. Keenan won an Emmy in 1990 for outstanding variety, music or comedy series (shared with Kevin Bright, Tamara Rawitt and Michael Petok) the year the show debuted. He went on to alternately write, direct, produce and/or act in films like \u201cScary Movie\u201d (2000), \u201cScary Movie 2\u201d (2001) and \u201cWhite Chicks\u201d (2004).

      "\u201cA Different World\u201d premiered on Sept. 24, 1987, and followed Denise Huxtable's (Lisa Bonet) time at Hillman College, a historically Black school. Bonet had played Denise, Cliff and Clair Huxtable\u2019s second-eldest child, for three seasons on \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d before that point.",
      "Heading into the spinoff, young audiences had fallen in love with Denise\u2019s sense of style and independent, popular, \u201cwild child\u201d energy. \u201cA Different World,\u201d like \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d was developed by Bill Cosby.",
      "Throughout the early seasons of \u201cA Different World,\u201d the Huxtable family made several appearances on the show, including Cliff (Cosby), Clair (Phylicia Rashad) and Denise\u2019s siblings, Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam) and Theo (Malcolm-Jamal Warner).",
      "Denise starts Season One rooming with a white student, Maggie Lauten (Marisa Tomei), and an older divorced student, Jaleesa Vinson.",
      "The original idea for \u201cA Different World\u201d didn\u2019t involve Denise in the starring role. Jay Sandrich, who worked on \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and directed one of the first episodes of \u201cA Different World,\u201d said in a 2001 interview with the Television Academy Foundation that the premise started with Cosby\u2019s idea of following a white student at an HBCU. Denise was still set to be the student\u2019s roommate, but the show would follow \u201cwhat\u2019s it like to be a white girl in a Black surrounding,\u201d he said.",
      "The idea was that the student was attending Hillman because Lena Horne was teaching an acting class.",
      "\u201cWe had preliminary casting,\u201d Sandrich said. \u201cAnd the casting director sent a girl from Los Angeles to meet us, who was going to be the roommate. The script hadn\u2019t been written yet. And we met with her, and we all fell in love with her because her name was Meg Ryan.\u201d",
      "Sandrich said Ryan\u2019s agents then decided \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t go into television.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarisa Tomei came in, and she was wonderful,\u201d Sandrich said.",
      "Horne ended up not joining the show, and during production the premise changed to follow Denise.",
      "\"A Different World\" originally spotlighted Denise, Maggie and Jaleesa's experiences as roommates.",
      "But after Season One, Bonet announced her pregnancy with then-husband Lenny Kravitz. They welcomed daughter Zoe Kravitz in December 1988.",
      "Debbie Allen, who started as a producer on \"A Different World\" in Season Two, said after Bonet told her about her pregnancy, they told Cosby the news together. Allen said she also wanted to write the pregnancy into the show.",
      "\"I got put in place as the new person in charge, we started talking about stories and then immediately, maybe about two or three weeks later, he says, 'You know what, Debbie. No. She's pregnant. Denise Huxtable is not pregnant,'\" Allen said in a 2011 interview with the Television Academy Foundation.",
      "Bonet then left the show, but she went back to \"The Cosby Show\" starting with its fifth season. She continued to appear on the sitcom until Season Seven.",
      "Similarly, Tomei's character was written off. Tomei said on TODAY in 2024 that she \u201chad a really good time on (\u2018A Different World\u2019), other than my unforgivable haircut.\u201d",
      "In the 2001 interview, Sandrich said the show's writers \u201cdidn\u2019t quite know how to write for Marisa.\u201d Allen said in her interview she was \"excited\" by the prospect of telling stories for Maggie. \"But we didn't get to do that,\" she said.",
      "Starting with Season Two, Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison) and Whitley Gilbert (Jasmine Guy) stepped more into the spotlight, and their love story became one of the main drivers of the show, though the sitcom is remembered as an ensemble effort.",
      "Cree Summer and Charnele Brown were also brought on as free spirit and activist Freddie Brooks and studious premed student Kim Reese, respectively.",
      "\u201cI think that was one of the real sacred keys about 'A Different World,' was that we represented all these different facets of young Black life that we had never seen before,\u201d\u00a0Summer told TODAY in 2024.",
      "While Sandrich and some \"Cosby Show\" writers developed the first few episodes of \"A Different World,\" they largely went back to working on the flagship sitcom after.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t really find its own voice for about two or three years until Debbie Allen came in,\u201d Sandrich said. \u201cIt became a different show.\u201d",
      "Allen joined the show in Season Two and has been described as its chief creative force.",
      "\"When I came on, they were like, 'Debbie, fix this. Make it relevant. Make it more real,'\" Allen said in the 2011 interview.",
      "Each episode of \u201cA Different World\u201d opened with a memorable theme song that fans of the show will never forget. The jazzy, upbeat track opened with the lyrics, \u201cI know my parents love me ...\u201d",
      "The song was composed and co-written by Lewis. The actor told Vulture in 2018 that she was also supposed to perform the song for the opening credits.",
      "\u201cIt was decided that would not be appropriate to have me sing the song 'cause it wasn\u2019t my show,\" she said. \"It was Lisa Bonet\u2019s show and they thought it would have put too much attention on me as the singer, composer, and co-star of the show. So they started looking for other options.\"",
      "Phoebe Snow sang the theme song for Season One. To switch things up for the sophomore season, none other than Aretha Franklin performed the song for the opening credits.",
      "Allen said booking Franklin started with a simple phone call.",
      "\u201cI wanted her, everybody did,\" Allen told Vulture. \"... she came all the way to California (from Detroit) and went into the recording studio and re-did that song for us and it became the iconic image of\u00a0'A Different World.'\"",
      "Franklin's version played in the opening titles for Seasons Two through Five.",
      "\u201cThey got Aretha Franklin thinking that for the next season they would have somebody else do it. Well, once Aretha recorded it, it was like, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re not having anybody else do this song,\u2019\u201d Lewis told Vulture.",
      "Of note, Season Six\u2019s version was performed by Boyz II Men.",
      "The cast of \"A Different World\" reunited on TODAY in 2024 to celebrate the show's lasting impact. When asked about the most memorable episode, the answer was unanimous: When Dwayne interrupted Whitley's wedding at the end of Season Five and professed his love for her.",
      "But the show also tackled heavy topics like racism, sexual assault, apartheid and more.",
      "For example, in one Season Five episode, Ron and Dwayne were involved in a fight with three white students from a rival college after a football game. Each character gave their account of what happened, gradually revealing the tense race relations at the origin of the fight.",
      "\"Addressing date rape and AIDS and war and gun violence and homelessness. But also, we were able to do that and make you laugh at the same time,\" Darryl M. Bell told TODAY.",
      "Another memorable episode of \"A Different World\" came in Season Four, starring Whoopi Goldberg as a professor who tasked the students with writing their own eulogies. One student, played by Tisha Campbell, read aloud her assignment and revealed that she was HIV positive.",
      "The episode, titled \"If I Should Die Before I Wake,\" aired in April 1991. \u201cI fought for a year to get that done,\u201d Allen told Entertainment Weekly that year.",
      "\"You would have thought we put Jesus Christ back on the cross the way (sighs) advertisers pulled out,\" she later told the Television Academy Foundation.",
      "Allen said the \"network was just furious\" and recalled NBC executive Warren Littlefield \"screaming\" at her.",
      "\"I don't know how, but it became our highest-rated episode, even without advertising support. That Whoopi was there, they knew something was up, everybody,\" Allen said in the 2011 interview.",
      "In addition to entertaining audiences, the show is also credited with increasing enrollment at HBCUs, as the series drew from real experiences at historically Black colleges and universities.",
      "A 1996 report from the National Center for Education Statistics found that enrollment at HBCUs increased by 26% between 1976 and 1994, \"but virtually all of the increase occurred between 1986 and 1994.\" (\u201cA Different World\u201d was on the air from 1987 to 1993.)",
      "\u201cEvery day, someone will say, 'I went to an HBCU because I watched \u2018A Different World.' I'm a doctor, I'm a lawyer, I'm an engineer because I watched 'A Different World,'\" Bell told TODAY in 2024. \"It's the most rewarding part of the work we've done.\"",
      "Hillman College is a fictional school set in Virginia. (The show filmed some shots of Hillman's buildings at real HBCUs, including Clark Atlanta University and Spelman College, according to Netflix's Tudum.)",
      "Allen has said that Howard University, her alma mater, was also part of the  \"blueprint\" for \"A Different World.\"",
      "While Hillman College isn't real, the online space known as HillmanTok University is. Per NBC News, the online community started when a North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University professor posted a welcome message to TikTok intended for her Introduction to African American Studies students.",
      "But Leah Barlow\u2019s video went viral, and it inspired more educators to share what they teach via TikTok. \"Enrollees\" can access a course catalog for 2025 at HillmanTok University's website.",
      "To celebrate the show's legacy, the cast of \"A Different World\" reunited for a massive tour of HBCUs across the United States in 2024. The tour aimed to increase awareness about HBCUs, connect with new audiences and raise funds for scholarships.",
      "The tour included stops at Howard, Spelman, Morehouse, Bowie State University and more.",
      "2024 proved to be a big year for \"A Different World.\" In addition to the tour, several outlets reported in August that a sequel series was in the works at Netflix and would reportedly focus on Whitley and Dwayne's daughter as she studies at Hillman.",
      "Netflix declined to comment at the time."

    "summary": "A retired surgeon admitted in court that he committed \u201chideous\u201d acts, as France\u2019s largest ever child sexual abuse case got underway on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "VANNES, France \u2014\u00a0A retired surgeon accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 people admitted in court that he committed \u201chideous\u201d acts, as France\u2019s largest ever child sexual abuse case got underway on Monday.",
      "\u201cIf I am appearing before you it\u2019s because one day, when most of these people were just children, I committed hideous acts,\u201d Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec said in a sober voice after Judge Aude Buresi, the president of a five-judge panel hearing the case, asked if he had a statement to make.",
      "Le Scouarnec, who was wearing a black coat and glasses, added that he was prepared to take responsibility for his actions \u201cand the consequences they may have had and may have for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how many victims the 74-year-old was referring to in his brief statement at the Palais de Justice in Vannes, a small town in Brittany, northwestern France.",
      "Defense lawyer Maxime Tessier told reporters outside court that Le Scouarnec, who is currently serving a 15-year sentence for the abuse of four other children, has admitted to the \u201cvast majority,\u201d of the charges but not all of them.",
      "Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, 42, who has accused the surgeon of raping her when she was just 9 years old and under anesthesia, is expected to testify against him during the trial, told NBC News she \u201cdidn\u2019t think much\u201d of Le Scouarnec\u2019s words.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really believe he is sincere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s good that they made him give this little speech. We\u2019ve always said he was silent.\u201d",
      "Sol\u00e8ne Podevin, the president of the Confronting Incest Association, also pointed out that he had acknowledges responsibility, \u201cbut not necessarily for all the acts.\u201d",
      "The trial, expected to last four months, will put a spotlight on the French medical system, which allowed him to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse that he downloaded from an internet site monitored by the FBI.",
      "Some of the victims\u2019 lawyers have said the once-respected local doctor should have been stripped of his medical privileges.",
      "Instead, Le Scouarnec, a father of three, moved on to other public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the FBI, we wouldn\u2019t have traced this back to Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec,\u201d said Francesca Satta, a lawyer for several of the victims.",
      "The trial is expected to feature hundreds of witnesses, among them Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend, both now in their 40s, who say they were assaulted in the early 1980s. Those allegations occurred too long ago to be prosecuted under French law.",
      "Much of the evidence against Le Scouarnec was carefully chronicled by the surgeon in digital diaries he kept on hard drives seized by investigators in the spring of 2017, after the mother of his 6-year-old neighbor reported that he\u00a0had raped the girl after luring her across a mesh fence in their gardens, prosecutors said.",
      "After his arrest, Le Scouarnec told investigators during several interrogations that he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began recording them in diaries, according to an outline of the case by the investigating judge.",
      "Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the court documents show.",
      "When investigators searched Le Scouarnec\u2019s house in May 2017, they found thousands of child pornography images as well as\u00a0 photos of the doctor performing sex acts on dolls and animals, according to a report by the investigating judge. Around\u00a05,000 videos of a \u201cviolent nature\u201d were also found, some showing acts of torture, the report said.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of raping the young neighbor and three others when they were children. He is currently serving 15 years in prison. He faces an additional 20 years if convicted of the latest charges \u2014 a sentence that lawyers say would run concurrently.",
      "The average age of the alleged 158 male and 141 female victims in the current trial is 11. The majority \u2014 256 \u2014 were under the age 15 at the time they were assaulted, most of them under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors allege.",
      "Court officials say they struggled to find venues large enough to stage the trial, which is expected to cost \u20ac3 million ($3.14 million). In the end, they decided to broadcast the trial in a former university building, around five minutes\u2019 walk from the courthouse in the center of Vannes, a Breton town with medieval ramparts, canals and a port dotted with sailboats.",
      "Victims and their families will be watching the trial on a screen in a 450-seat auditorium.",
      "The more than 450 journalists who have been accredited to cover the trial can watch a live feed in another part of the building, away from the victims. Testimony will play out in the main courthouse, with around 60 lawyers cycling through before the trial wraps up in mid-June.",
      "For many victims, that distance from their abuser was the latest blow in a process which has often made them feel sidelined, said lawyer Marie Grimaud, who is representing 37 of them.",
      "\u201cEverything is conspiring to make us invisible and to keep us at a distance, as if we were only second-rate players in this trial,\u201d reads an open letter Grimaud released on behalf of her clients.",
      "But L\u00e9v\u00eaque, who learned about her alleged rape from investigators, said she preferred to stay far away from the doctor.",
      "\u201cI feel protected.\u201d she said."

      "Tens of thousands of people gathered at a stadium in Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut to mourn Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a public funeral nearly five months after he was killed by an Israeli airstrike.",
      "Determined to project strength despite the devastating losses it has faced since Nasrallah\u2019s death \u2014 including leadership uncertainty and mounting Israeli military pressure \u2014 a weakened Hezbollah staged the funeral as a display of unity and resilience.",
      "Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 when Israeli forces bombed a building in southern Beirut where he was meeting with Hezbollah commanders. It was a stunning assassination that shocked supporters in Lebanon and across the region, as Israel celebrated killing a man who had orchestrated attacks on the country and posed a threat to its security.",
      "Hezbollah began exchanging fire with Israel in support of Palestinians on Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Israel declared war on Hamas following the Oct. 7 attacks. The 14-month conflict lead to an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon and prolonged bombing of Beirut that targeted Hezbollah leadership and led to Nasrallah\u2019s death.",

      "After Nasrallah\u2019s death, his body was buried temporarily next to his son, Hadi, who died fighting for Hezbollah in 1997. Nasrallah\u2019s official funeral was delayed until Israeli forces had withdrawn from south Lebanon under the terms of a ceasefire deal that ended the war.",
      "As his funeral took place, the Israel Defense Forces launched airstrikes in southern Lebanon on \u201ca military site containing rocket launchers and weapons\u201d where it said it had identified Hezbollah activity.",
      "According to the Lebanese National News Agency, the strikes injured at least one girl, who was transported to the Lebanese Italian Hospital for treatment.",

Revered by Hezbollah supporters, the Islamic scholar transformed the group from a militant resistance faction to an influential political and military force in the region.",
      "While thousands paid tribute to the former leader, he left behind a legacy marked by deep admiration and intense controversy.",
      "Born into a poor Shiite family in Beirut in 1960,\u00a0Nasrallah\u2019s rise to prominence was shaped by Lebanon\u2019s turbulent history and his deep ideological commitments.",

      "Designated a terrorist organization by many countries, including the United States, Canada and the European Union, Hezbollah attacks included the 1983 Beirut embassy bombing that killed 63 people, including 17 Americans, and the Marine barracks bombing that same year in the capital, which killed 307 people, including 241 American military personnel.",
      "Nasrallah became its leader in 1992, marking a transformative era for Hezbollah in which it expanded its military capabilities and political influence in Lebanon. Under his guidance, Hezbollah fought the 2006 war with Israel, as rockets rained down on northern Israel while Israeli airstrikes ravaged southern Lebanon for 34 days.",
      "His influence soared during the conflict, where he was widely regarded as a symbol of defiance across the Arab world. Hezbollah\u2019s extensive media apparatus amplified his charisma, making him an influential figure beyond Lebanon\u2019s borders.",
      "He also forged deep alliances with Iran and Syria, with Iran providing critical financial, military and political support that helped Hezbollah become a major regional force.",
      "However, his decision to send fighters to Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad in the country\u2019s civil war marked a turning point. Once seen as the leader of resistance, he became increasingly viewed as an agent of Iran\u2019s regional ambitions.",
      "Accusations of Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri further eroded his standing in parts of the Arab world.",
      "As Israel launched its ground invasion in southern Lebanon and bombarded its capital from the skies, Nasrallah\u2019s death delivered a major blow early in Israel\u2019s offensive, significantly weakening the Iran-backed group while raising questions about its future.",
      "To his supporters, he remained a steadfast defender of Shia Muslims and Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. To his critics, he was a divisive figure, aligning Hezbollah\u2019s trajectory with Tehran at the expense of national unity.",
      "His contested legacy is emblematic of the shifting political and sectarian currents of the Middle East, but his funeral underscored the enduring devotion of his followers."

      "L\u00e9v\u00eaque is set to testify at France\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse trial, which opens Monday in Vannes, a picturesque town in coastal Brittany. Former surgeon Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, 74, is charged with raping or sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades, most of them girls and boys under 15 whose average age was 11.",
      "Many victims have said they don\u2019t remember being assaulted and experienced similar symptoms to L\u00e9v\u00eaque\u2019s, their lawyers said. Others suffered sexual dysfunction and fell into substance abuse. When police, taking names from Le Scouarnec\u2019s writings, sought them out and showed them the passages written about them, those revelations triggered physical and psychological reactions of varying degrees, the lawyers added. Two men, both 25, died by suicide in 2020 and 2021.",
      "The case, which includes a dark history of incest, has raised questions about how a well-respected surgeon who worked in nine hospitals and clinics across five regions in northwest France was allowed to practice when there were so many red flags that legal observers say should have signaled that Le Scouarnec was dangerous, including a 2005 conviction for possessing material depicting child sexual abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyers declined to comment, but prosecutors said he has admitted to many, but not all, of the charges. Unlike in the United States, defendants in France are brought to trial even if they admit guilt.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates hope the trial, set to last four months, will prompt a hard look at what they call a lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d said Francesca Satta, who is representing 10 victims and families. \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "\u2018Pedophile fantasies\u2019",
      "Beyond the medical world, the lines have often blurred in France over what constitutes child abuse versus seduction.\u00a0The once-celebrated writer Gabriel Matzneff, now 88, made having sex with adolescents a staple of his books, even boasting about the practice in an infamous TV interview, until a leading literary publisher, Vanessa Springora, called him out in her own 2020 book for grooming her for sex in the 1980s when she was 14 and he was 50.",
      "It is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged. Earlier this month, in a closely watched case seen as a test of evolving attitudes toward sex with minors, the director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually assaulting actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel, now 35, from the time he cast her in a film when she was 12 and he was 36. He was sentenced to two years of house arrest, with two years suspended.",
      "\u201cL\u2019Affaire Scouarnec\u201d has drawn parallels with another high-profile trial that transfixed the country late last year and led to the conviction of Dominique Pelicot, 72, for organizing and documenting the mass rape of his sleeping wife, whom he drugged, by dozens of men over a decade. He is now under investigation for two other alleged crimes involving drugging: the rape and murder of a young woman in 1991 and the attempted rape of another in 1999.",
      "As in the Pelicot case, investigators discovered a trove of allegedly incriminating evidence on hard drives seized in the suspect\u2019s house, including thousands of photos depicting child sexual abuse and videos, many of them violent, French media reported.",
      "Le Scouarnec allegedly told investigators he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began keeping a diary, according to court documents. Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the\u00a0documents show.",
      "The assaults tracked in the digital diaries stop in March 2017, when Le Scouarnec was arrested on charges of raping his 6-year-old neighbor after luring her across a gap in the mesh fence between their gardens, according to testimony. In December 2020, he was convicted in that case, along with the rape and sexual assault of two of his nieces when they were children in the 1980s and \u201990s, and a 4-year-old patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the 15 years he is now serving in connection with the 2020 conviction. With his pretrial detention and parole eligibility taken into account, he could be out by 2030, said lawyer Marie Grimaud.",
      "Grimaud, who is representing 37 victims, and other lawyers say the penalties for sex crimes and child abuse should be much more severe.",
      "\u201cIn France, if you rape one person, you rape 300, it\u2019s exactly the same number of years you\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.",
      "Warning signs",
      "The first people who knew about Le Scouarnec\u2019s behavior were his family. As early as 1984, references to the rapes of a niece and a family friend appear in the surgeon\u2019s diaries, according to court documents. But none of the adults took action, even after the children told them, and the abuse continued, three family members told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is a man who sees children as sexual objects,\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece Alexandra, 47, told NBC News. She said her uncle isolated her and then raped her from ages 5 to 13. (NBC News does not name victims\u00a0of sexual assault, but Alexandra has asked that her first name be used.)",
      "She said she will testify at the upcoming trial, along with a family friend who was also one of the first victims mentioned in the diaries, though Le Scouarnec cannot be charged in their cases because the acts happened too long ago under French law.",
      "Some children knew Le Scouarnec\u2019s \u201cexam\u201d was not appropriate, but their parents brushed aside their complaints, said Hugo Lemonier, a journalist who spent three years researching a new book about the case, \u201cTrapped: In the Intimate Diaries of Dr. Le Scouarnec.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we see in this case is the omnipotence of the medical profession,\u201d he said.",
      "French authorities were first alerted in January 2004, when the FBI told them Le Scouarnec\u2019s credit card was linked to a pedophile website the agency was monitoring, court records show. There is no indication that medical authorities were notified as the police carried out their investigation.",
      "At his trial for possession of child sexual abuse material in the fall of 2005, the surgeon was \u201calmost considered a victim,\u201d Lemonier said. Le Scouarnec presented himself as a man \u201cin a moment of great distress,\u201d recounting how his wife had left him, taking their three kids, and in his solitude he \u201cfound a refuge, an escape\u201d in viewing the material, he added.",
      "The surgeon, who specialized in appendectomies and abdominal and gynecological surgery, got a break when the judge imposed a four-month suspended sentence with no restrictions.",
      "\u201cThe judge could have ordered him to stop practicing or seek treatment, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Homayra Sellier, founder of the child protection agency Innocence in Danger. \u201cHe should have lost his medical license.\u201d",
      "Another opportunity was missed in June 2006, when a psychiatrist at the hospital where Le Scouarnec worked in Quimperl\u00e9, on the southern coast of Brittany, learned about his conviction and wrote a letter alerting the hospital director, who passed it along to the local medical board and ordered the surgeon to be accompanied whenever he was with minors, according to France Info.",
      "\u2018A nutcase in Brittany\u2019",
      "The local medical board requested a copy of the conviction, but it took the prosecutor\u2019s office five months to send it, which was then forwarded to state authorities, Lemonier said. \u201cAfter that, they washed their hands of it.\u201d",
      "Back at the hospital, the order requiring the surgeon to be shadowed was never carried out, and Le Scouarnec, whose modus operandi was to isolate victims under the guise of examining them, would go on to abuse at least 54 more victims from 2004 to 2017, all of whom are part of the current case, Lemonier said.",
      "Not all of the victims in the diaries have been pursued by investigators, he said, adding that according to his count the total could top 400.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a chain of failures where nobody wanted to take responsibility,\u201d Lemonier said. \u201cThe police, the courts, the medical association, the hospitals, the health authorities and the state are all responsible.\u201d",
      "The hospital director, Andr\u00e9 Labat, died in 2013. The current administration declined to comment when contacted by NBC News, as did all of the boards that could have imposed sanctions or revoked Le Scouarnec\u2019s medical license, including the local and regional medical boards and the regional health agency. The national Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The local branch of the national police referred questions to the national police press office, which also did not respond.",
      "\u201cThe French authorities were warned that we had a nutcase in Brittany,\u201d said lawyer Maud Touitou, who represents eight victims. She called local oversight boards \u201cbarons\u201d that \u201crevel in their provincial social status, who have no other goal but to continue to have and exercise their little power.\u201d",
      "In June 2008, Le Scouarnec moved to a hospital in Jonzac, about five hours\u2019 drive south, where he was considered the \u201cwise man\u201d on staff, Le Monde reported. The hospital\u2019s former director, Mich\u00e8le Cals, told police in 2017 that she didn\u2019t take \u201cany special measures\u201d when the surgeon told her about his conviction because there had been \u201cno physical aggression,\u201d according to Radio France, which counted more than 20 victims at the Jonzac hospital. Cals could not be reached for comment, and the Jonzac hospital declined to comment.",
      "\u200b\u200bChildren\u2019s advocates are hoping the trial will prompt sweeping changes beyond tougher laws. They are hoping that the accounts of victims will be given greater credence.",
      "For the victims, who have waited nearly eight years since the investigation began to tell their stories \u2014 some have waited decades \u2014 the trial represents a chance to heal.",
      "\u201cThe only fear they have is that the entire trial will focus on Le Scouarnec,\u201d Grimaud said.",
      "\u201cThey want to be recognized.\u201d",
      "Linda Hervieux reported from Paris, and Gabrielle Nolin from London.",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org.

      "The call appeared aimed at dispelling any such prospects \u2014 the two leaders underscored the durability and the \u201clong-term\u201d nature of their alliance, with its own internal dynamics that would not be impacted by any \u201cthird party.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A woman may have signed her name on the world's oldest dated runestone, researchers in Norway have found, as they piece together the 2,000-year-old puzzle.",
      "The inscription begins with the word \u201cI\u201d in runic script, followed by the name of the writer and a verb that indicates writing, before ending with the word \u201crune,\u201d researchers wrote earlier this month in the journal Antiquity after studying a fragment of the stone found at a grave site in Hole, a small municipality in southern Norway to the east of the capital, Oslo.",
      "\u201cBasically the text would be saying, I, the rune inscriber\u2019s name, wrote the runic inscription,\u201d one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Kristel Zilmer, told NBC News in telephone interview Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a type of inscription also that has parallels in some other romantic inscriptions, basically somebody telling us that they made this inscription,\u201d added Zilmer, a professor of runology at the University of Oslo\u2019s Museum of Cultural History.",
      "The researchers said they believed the Germanic alphabetic script was inspired by the Roman alphabet, of which runes formed the foundational blocks in the first A.D. centuries. It was widely used in Scandinavia up until the late Middle Ages.",
      "Runic inscriptions have been found on objects such as a bone knife and iron knife from Denmark and a comb, which archeologists have dated to around 150 A.D. Those found on other runestones date to around 700 A.D.",
      "Often they bore messages, including spells to bring back the dead and charm words.",
      "But very little is known about their development as it varied over time and deciphering them can be challenging without archaeological context.",
      "The latest research suggests the fragments, the first of which was discovered in 2021, were part of a single slab. The discovery also brings scientists one step closer to understanding the language\u2019s evolution and the use of such stones, the researchers said.",
      "Two years later, researchers found more fragments and the script on them appeared to continue across the fragments, indicating they were all part of a single stone.",
      "\u201cThey managed to find two extra pieces, and they fit perfectly within the middle part of one of the inscriptions, and gave us almost a complete inscription,\u201d Zilmer said.",
      "Due to the damage and the weathering of the stone, she added that determining the exact text, including the name of the inscriber, is a \u201cbit tricky,\u201d but what especially caught the attention of the researchers is a feature in the name that indicates it ended with a \u201c-u.\u201d",
      "In ancient runic script, she said that would indicate a possible woman\u2019s name which, if confirmed, \u201cwould be the earliest known record of a female rune-inscriber.\u201d",
      "Because the fragments found in Hole were buried along with cremated human remains, scientists had the crucial archeological context that allowed them to use radiocarbon dating to confirm the fragments dated between 50 B.C. and 275 A.D.",
      "\u201cWe may have here a series of events unfolding involving different people,\u201d Zilmer said. \u201cIt may be a stone that combines different purposes.\u201d",
      "While much of the research is still ongoing, \u201cwe are still missing significant portions, so there are evident gaps,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle with holes, but nonetheless it will be very interesting to see how far we can get, how many of these small fragments, some of these also inscribed, that might be able to connect to each other,\u201d she added."

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:47:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Germany woke Monday after an election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes but far-right nationalists surged to huge gains causing dismay.",
    "story": [
      "BERLIN \u2014 Germany woke Monday to the aftermath of a bruising election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes and far-right nationalists surged to huge gains, causing dismay in a country deeply wary of its Nazi past.",
      "The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is under surveillance by German intelligence over suspected far-right extremism, experienced its largest-ever share of the vote, garnering the support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump administration.",
      "The White House\u2019s alleged interference in the run-up to the vote sparked unusually fierce criticism from Friedrich Merz, the leader of the victorious Christian Democratic Union, who will lead coalition talks to form Germany's next government.",
      "Merz told supporters at a party event in Berlin on Sunday night: \u201cI have no illusions at all about what is happening from America. Take a look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "If Merz, who said Monday that he plans to quickly form Germany's next government, does become the next chancellor, then his in tray will be bursting.",
      "Domestically, he would have to deal with widespread unrest over immigration at home, fueled by a spate of high-profile attacks in recent weeks and a flagging economy. That might be harder after the AfD and the radical Left Party won enough seats to block\u00a0constitutional changes needed to loosen state borrowing limits \u2014 changes economists say are essential to reviving growth.",
      "Internationally, Merz would have to navigate the fraying bond between Washington and Europe, of which Germany is the most populous country and biggest economy. There is also the matter of the war in Ukraine, over which the AfD and radical Left's sway may also stymie raising Germany's defense and military aid budget.",
      "All the while, Merz would have one eye on the far right, which has been surging across Europe while enjoying mutual support from President Donald Trump and his aides.",
      "Musk has previously endorsed the AfD, hosting party events on the X social media platform that he owns and appearing at a campaign rally during which he repeated one of the party\u2019s most controversial points of view, which is that young Germans should no longer feel guilty for the events of the Holocaust in their country\u2019s past.",
      "Merz said Sunday that \u201cthe interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. So we are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\u201d",
      "By design, Germany\u2019s voting system means it is very difficult for one party to govern alone, forcing leaders to work together and form coalitions to govern this consensus-based country. Merz said that he hoped to form a government by Easter, but added that cooperating with the second-placed AfD was \u201ccompletely out of the question.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s political establishment has long maintained an informal \u201cfirewall\u201d against cooperating with the far right that is seen as a bulwark against fascism.",
      "Merz\u2019s CDU party won 28.5% of the vote and 208 of the 630 seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, according to results that are set to be validated by lawmakers March 15.",
      "The AfD won 20.5% and 152 seats, while the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party fell to 15.5% and 120 seats. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been effectively voted out of office, calling the interventions by Washington \u201cdisgusting\u201d Sunday.",
      "The environmentally focused Greens got 11.6% and 85 seats, and the leftist Die Linke party received 8.8% and 64 seats, while the pro-business Free Democrats and left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance failed to meet the 5% threshold that would allow them to enter parliament."

      "The campaign was dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe\u2019s biggest economy and pressure to curb migration, something that caused friction after Merz pushed hard in recent weeks for a tougher approach. It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe\u2019s alliance with the United States.",
      "The results released by the electoral authority showed Merz\u2019s Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.",
      "That gives Merz the best chance of becoming the country\u2019s next chancellor. He said on election night that he hopes to form a government by Easter at the latest.",
      "He has ruled out a coalition with the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which is now the country\u2019s second-largest party after its best showing ever.",
      "For the time being, departing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose Social Democratic party suffered a stinging defeat, will remain.",
      "Merz\u2019s conservatives won 208 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, while the AfD won 152. The three parties in the former governing coalition lost seats, with the SDP falling to 120 seats and the Greens to 85. The pro-business Free Democrats, which triggered early elections by pulling out of the coalition, failed to reach the 5% of the vote required to win seats.",
      "The Left party got 64 seats, while the left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance came in just under the 5% hurdle.",
      "The AfD was jubilant on Sunday night, with leaders vowing to become the country\u2019s main party in the next election as its appeal expands. The anti-immigrant, far-right party has established itself as a significant political force in the 12 years since it was founded, but it hasn\u2019t yet been part of any state or national government.",
      "That\u2019s the result of what is often called a \u201cfirewall\u201d against Alternative for Germany. Other parties say they won\u2019t work with the AfD, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected right-wing extremism, something that AfD objects to strongly. Its branches in three eastern states are designated \u201cproven right-wing extremist\u201d groups, which is particularly sensitive in view of Germany\u2019s Nazi past.",
      "The election took place seven months earlier than originally planned after Scholz\u2019s unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There was widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates.",
      "Merz said Sunday night that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the U.S. and Russia. Both Vice President JD Vance and Trump ally Elon Musk openly supported the AfD.",

      "\"I have recently received many messages of affection, and I have been particularly struck by the letters and drawings from children,\" he said. \"Thank you for your closeness, and for the consoling prayers I have received from all over the world!\"",

      "The pope\u2019s latest health struggle has been somewhat of a roller coaster as Francis took a turn a few days after the Vatican said he was in stable condition last week. It even said he was showing \u201cslight improvement\u201d in a Wednesday update.",

The CDU led the poll with 28.7%, meaning its leader Friedrich Merz will lead negotiations with other parties to form the next government.",
      "The AfD is unlikely to be part of the government, as Germany\u2019s coalition system requires cooperation among parties, and the others have refused to collaborate with the far-right group. But the party\u2019s rise into the political mainstream has appalled large swaths of a country deeply aware of its Nazi past.",
      "It\u2019s part of a wider surge of the far right in Europe, whose proponents are already forging connections with Trump\u2019s White House. The AfD\u2019s ascent has come amid a spate of attacks across Germany, some of them by people with a migrant background. Also on the agenda has been Germany\u2019s stagnant economy and the war in Ukraine.",

I\u2019m focusing on Ukraine\u2019s security today, not in 20 years. And I don\u2019t intend to stay in power for decades.\u201d",

      "\u201cI am the elected president by 73% of Ukrainian people. After the martial law, there will be elections. Perhaps he will say something good about me. It is more important what Ukrainians think about me,\u201d the Ukrainian president added.",

    "story": [
      "Waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle surrounded by a large, cheering crowd, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa appeared in a video to receive something of a hero's welcome in his first visit to Latakia, once the stronghold of the Assad family whose brutal regime he helped topple just more than two months ago.",
      "Later that Sunday, Sharaa visited Tartus, another Assad stronghold about 50 miles south along the Mediterranean Sea, where video showed him waving from a balcony as hundreds of people cheered below.",
      "The two videos, shared on social media and verified by NBC News, emerged as Sharaa's government touted a successful visit to both port cities, with experts describing the scenes as marking a pivotal moment in the rebel leader's campaign to prove he can deliver on his promise to build a more unified Syria.",
      "\"After spending time across Syria, Sharaa\u2019s celebrity-like status was genuinely palpable \u2014 across ethnic, religious & gender communities,\" Charles Lister, a senior fellow and head of the Syria Initiative\u00a0at the Middle East Institute, said in a post on X on Sunday, reacting to video of Sharaa's reception.",
      "\u201cThis is an outpouring of goodwill and a sense of optimism in what he may be able to deliver for the country,\u201d Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, told NBC News on Monday. But, she also cautioned that these jubilant scenes were likely \"carefully choreographed to capture the enthusiasm that he has summoned across the country, even in ex-regime strongholds.\"",
      "In addition to meeting with representatives in Tartus and Latakia, Sharaa also met with prominent figures in Aleppo province earlier Sunday, according SANA, Syria\u2019s state news agency. His visit to Aleppo came after he met with community leaders from his former stronghold of Idlib province in northwestern Syria, the news agency reported. Sharaa visited Idlib city, as well as camps hosting hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the Assad regime, according to SANA.",
      "Western nations have kept a close and cautious eye on Sharaa's rise as they weigh his past as a former jihadist leader with links to the Islamic State terrorist group and Al Qaeda against the image he has sought to project as a reformed figurehead vowing to lead an inclusive Syria representative of the country's diversity of religious and ethnic communities.",
      "In the just over two months since Sharaa and his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, rebel group led the overthrow of dictator Bashar al-Assad, there have already been flashes of doubt that the new administration could step away from its Islamist leanings.",
      "But Sharaa, who has shown a willingness to recalibrate in the face of criticism, has also made noticeable headway in his efforts to reassure Western leaders that he seeks a future for Syria that does not pose a threat to the West.",
      "\"There are skeptics both inside the country and outside who continue to see red flags around the 'transition',\" Ozcelik said, noting that these are still early days in Sharaa's leadership.",
      "But, she added, \"it may be wise to pause for a moment and consider the possibility that this is a genuine transformation, and in the interest of the Syrian people, its neighbors and the international community.\"",
      "With much of his schedule dominated by calls with counterparts around the world and media interviews with international outlets, that is certainly the impression Sharaa has sought to build.",
      "In a statement last week, the office of outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had spoken with Sharaa, with the two leaders agreeing on \"the importance of an inclusive political process to ensure lasting peace and stability for all Syrians.\"",
      "Sharaa also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. The Kremlin, which heavily backed the Assad regime throughout Syria's deadly civil war, including through military intervention, described the discussion as \"constructive and businesslike\" and covering \u201cacute issues of practical cooperation in trade and economic, education and other spheres\" as it seeks to continue the use of naval and air bases inside Syria.",
      "The call followed a visit to Damascus by a delegation of Russian officials last month, marking the first such trip since Assad's overthrow. The dictator was granted asylum by Moscow, Russian state media has reported."
