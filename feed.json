      "Warner Music Group has resolved its copyright dispute with Udio and signed a deal to collaborate on a new AI song creation service",
      "LONDON -- Warner Music Group resolved its copyright battle with Udio and signed a deal to work with the AI music startup on a new song creation service that will allow users to remix tunes by established artists.",
      "It's the second agreement between a major record label and Udio, a chatbot-style song generation tool.",
      "The deals underline how AI is shaking up the music industry. AI-generated music has been flooding streaming services amid the rise of song generators that instantly spit out new tunes based on prompts typed in by users without any musical knowledge. The synthetic music boom has also resulted in a wave of AI singers and bands that have climbed the charts after racking up millions of streams, even though they don't exist in real life.",
      "Warner, which represents artists including Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa, has resolved its copyright infringement litigation against Udio, the two companies said. They've also established \u201da clear framework\" for developing Udio\u2019s licensed AI music creation service that's set to launch in 2026.",
      "They provided no financial details on their agreement, which includes Warner's recording and publishing businesses, but it will create \u201cnew revenue streams for artists and songwriters, while ensuring their work remains protected.\"",

      "With an estimated price of $40 million to $60 million, \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d \u2013 in English, \u201cThe Dream (The Bed)\u201d \u2014 may surpass the top price for a work by any female artist when it goes under the hammer.

      "The painting up for auction depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden colonial-style bed, wrapped in a golden blanket embroidered with crawling vines and leaves. Above her, seemingly levitating atop the bedposts, lies a full-sized skeleton.",
      "In its catalog note, Sotheby's said the painting \u201coffers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.\u201d",

      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "\u201cThe suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,\u201d the catalog notes.",

      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",

      "The story of how she arrived in Antarctica is an unlikely one. Paine grew up in the hot, dry climate of Adelaide, Australia, where she dreamed of visiting the frozen continent as a scientist.",
      "She studied music at university instead, putting Antarctica out of her mind. Years later however, as a musician in New Zealand\u2019s navy, Paine learned members of the country\u2019s military were stationed in Antarctica to support the work of scientists.",

      "Her dream was revived but enacting it wasn\u2019t simple. It took four years of unsuccessful applications before Paine landed a posting as a communications operator.",
      "It\u2019s a consuming job, worked in six-day stretches that leave little time for music. Paine monitors radio, phone, email and other communications traffic at New Zealand\u2019s mission at Scott Base, sometimes speaking to people on the ice who haven\u2019t heard other voices for weeks.",
      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",
      "While she plays by the window, watching seals on the ice, Paine finds new musical motifs bubbling up.",

      "George Clooney stars in \"Jay Kelly,\" a film by Noah Baumbach that blurs reality and fiction, says Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy",
      "During his glittering career, George Clooney has played a casino thief, a Batman,a chain-gang convict, an assassin and a high-flying layoff artist. This fall, he's stretching even more, playing an utterly charming and gorgeous movie star. Kidding!",
      "Reality and fiction beautifully weave in and out in \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d director Noah Baumbach's love letter to Hollywood that, in other hands, could so easily have become just a love letter to Clooney.",
      "The script by Baumbach and Emily Mortimer finds Clooney \u2014 sorry, Jay Kelly \u2014 in a sort of midlife funk. He's 60, a universally beloved, deeply earnest movie hunk who has worked his way to the top and found, well, artifice.",
      "\u201cMy life doesn't really feel real,\u201d he says at one point, an actor trained in pretending going meta playing an actor trained in pretending. In another scene he muses: \u201cAll my memories are movies.\u201d",
      "A chance meeting with an old acting partner \u2014 a brilliant Billy Crudup, whose character was betrayed by Kelly years ago \u2014 reveals some unpleasant truths. \u201cIs there a person in there? Maybe you don\u2019t actually exist,\u201d he asks the star, sending Kelly on a journey of self-discovery that just so happens to lead to one of Clooney's favorite places, Italy.",
      "Kelly's careful facade \u2014 the stories he tells about himself \u2014 soon gets chipped away. On his way up the hills of Hollywood, he apparently left some personal carnage behind. \u201cJay Kelly\u201d is about those who sacrificed to get him there.",
      "Adam Sandler and Laura Dern play Kelly's long-suffering manager and publicist, respectively, while his resentful adult daughters are portrayed by Grace Edwards and Riley Keough. Kelly, we learn, put career first and that meant walking away from things like his daughters' school recitals and making his staff miss things like their daughters\u2019 school recitals. \u201cHe's not our family or our friend,\u201d Dern's character screams in despair. \u201cWe're not to him what he is to us.\u201d",
      "You'd expect Clooney to not have to shift out of second gear for this, but he gives a soulful performance, charming enough that his Kelly seduces a trainful of strangers in Italy with his aw-shucks charisma and yet also bristles when his oldest daughter makes him confront her abandonment issues.",
      "\u201cDo you know how I knew you didn't want to spend time with me?\u201d his daughter asks him, before answering in a line that will land like a gut punch with any parent: \u201cBecause you didn't spend time with me.\u201d Another killer: \u201cI wish you were the man I thought you were.\u201d",

There are jokes made about the Method school of acting and being a Dior ambassador, but this is ultimately about mortality and life choices, with one scene actually ending in a cemetery, a little too on the nose.",
      "Kelly melts into past vignettes like watching his own long-ago breakout drama audition and his kids' joyous household revelry. It reaches for the surreal in a mist-filled forest and finds redemption in, of course, a movie theater. A retrospective montage uses such real Clooney roles like \u201cCombat Academy\u201d and \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d further blurring the line between fact and fiction.",

There emerges an off-putting, in-his-own-world Jay Gatsby vibe to him, alluded to by his first name and the name of one of his daughters, Daisy.",
      "We see his cluelessness up close when he won't actually listen to his assistants or thoughtlessly tosses away a gift of a neckerchief from a dead colleague's son. He reveals his vanity when he tries to hide his age with a black Sharpie on his eyebrows.",

      "Danny Masterson has filed a petition to overturn his two rape convictions and long prison sentence",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d actor Danny Masterson filed a petition Monday for his two rape convictions and long prison sentence to be thrown out, saying that his trial lawyer failed to call key witnesses and introduce essential evidence that might have exonerated him.",
      "The petition for habeas corpus filed with California's 2nd District Court of Appeal argues that lawyer Philip Cohen did not represent Masterson properly at the 2023 retrial that ended with the actor being convicted of raping two women at his Los Angeles home in 2003. He was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.",
      "The petition also argues that the trial judge demonstrated a bias against the Church of Scientology, allowing an \u201cunconstitutional intrusion\u201d into the church's doctrine and a misinterpretation of its scripture.",
      "Masterson is a member of the church, whose practices were a major issue at his trial, and the women are former members.",
      "The petition says that Cohen spoke to only two of the 20 potential witnesses brought to his attention by his co-counsel and an investigator. It says the witnesses included some who would have testified that the women spoke favorably of the sexual relationships they had with Masterson. And they included psychological and pharmacological experts who would have testified about the effects of alcohol and drugs on memory.",
      "The court filing says there was \u201cunexpected and unreasonable failure of trial counsel to present any of the mountain of exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been amassed by Masterson's pretrial attorney Shawn Holley, and the result was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo declined to delay Masterson\u2019s first trial to accommodate Holley\u2019s representation of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer against his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Cohen then took over as lead attorney.",
      "Masterson's first trial ended in a mistrial with a jury unable to reach consensus on any of three rape counts against him. He was promptly retried, and a jury found him guilty of two counts while failing to reach a verdict on the third.",

      "NEW YORK -- If there's been one uniting theme of all the blockbuster fashion exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it\u2019s the simple idea that fashion is art.",
      "\u201cCostume Art,\u201d announced Monday as the next big show at the museum\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 launched by the starry Met Gala in 2026 \u2014 aims to make that connection more literal than ever, pairing garments with objects from across the museum to show how fashion has long been intertwined with different art forms.",
      "Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Met, said in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement that he hopes the exhibit will take visitors to the New York museum on a (very fashionable) journey through art history, where they will see connections throughout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\u201d Hollein said.",
      "\u201cI hope we all agree that fashion is art,\u201d Hollein added. \u201cBut actually I think the exhibition \u2026 will make it obvious how fashion is actually happening, so to say, all across the museum and in all different mediums already.\u201d",
      "The new show will examine the dressed body, and will be organized thematically by different body types, according to the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton. It will include the \u201cNaked Body\u201d and the \u201cClassical Body,\u201d for example, but also less expected themes like the \u201cPregnant Body\u201d and the \u201cAging Body.\u201d",
      "The connections that will be drawn between artworks and garments will range, curators said in a statement, \u201cfrom the formal to the conceptual, the aesthetic to the political, the individual to the universal, the illustrative to the symbolic, and the playful to the profound.\u201d",
      "One example: in the \u201cNaked Body\u201d section, a 1504 print from German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer will be paired with spandex bodysuits by Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck from a 2009 collection that revisits the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.",

      "\u201cMaking movies is not what I do, it's who I am,\u201d said Cruise. He was composed as always, but at moments seemed near tears as he spoke, grasping the gold honorary statuette that celebrated his more than 40 years at the apex of the industry at the film academy's annual Governors Awards.",
      "\u201cIn that theater we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together,\u201d he said after a two-minute ovation.",
      "Production designer Wynn Thomas and choreographer and actor Debbie Allen were also selected by the academy's board of governors to be honored for their storied careers, and an absent Dolly Parton was honored for a lifetime of philanthropy at the ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles.",
      "A competitive Oscar has eluded Cruise, who's been nominated four times: as an actor for 1989\u2019s \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d 1996\u2019s \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia,\u201d and as a producer for 2022\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",

      "It was fitting that the Governors Awards aren't televised. Tom Cruise doesn't do TV, and he's been among the biggest champions of the theatergoing experience over streaming.",
      "\u201cI will always do everything I can to help this art form,\u201d Cruise said. \u201cTo support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful. Hopefully without too many more broken bones.\u201d",
      "Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu presented Cruise the award. The two have spent several months shooting a film in London set for release in 2026. The collaboration suggests that Cruise, who has stuck to blockbuster franchise fare in recent years, might not be done trying to win an Academy Award the old-fashioned way.",
      "\u201cThis may be his first Oscar,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said, \u201cbut from what I have seen and experienced, this will not be the last.\u201d",

      "His freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure.",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Todd Snider, a singer whose thoughtfully freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure in American roots music, has died. He was 59.",
      "His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday.",
      "\u201cWhere do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlways creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",
      "But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.",
      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a \u201csinger-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\u201d and a \u201cstoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\u201d",
      "He modeled himself on \u2014 and at times met and was mentored by \u2014 artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine. His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song with Loretta Lynn that appeared on her 2016 album, \u201cFull Circle.\u201d",

      "Snider would do his best-known and most acclaimed work for Prine's independent label Oh Boy in the early 2000s. It included the albums \u201cNew Connection,\u201d \u201cNear Truths and Hotel Rooms\u201d and \u201cEast Nashville Skyline,\u201d a 2004 collection that's considered by many to be his best.",

      "Snider had an early fan in Jimmy Buffett, who signed the young artist to his record label, Margaritaville, which released his first two albums, 1994's \u201cSongs for the Daily Planet\u201d and 1996's \u201cStep Right Up.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House Historical Association has reclaimed a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell, spending a whopping $7.25 million at auction on Friday.",
      "The four 1940s-era sketches titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d were displayed in the West Wing for years, but were removed in 2022 after a family dispute over who owned them.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 seated on plush-looking red chairs as they waited to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who had received them as a gift from Rockwell.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how personally thrilled I am that the White House Historical Association preserved this piece of White House history,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association\u2019s board of directors.",
      "The White House Historical Association's winning bid was $5.8 million. It's total cost to reclaim the art, including the buyer's premium paid to the auction house, was $7.25 million.",
      "The price tag is by far the most ever paid by the association, which holds a vast collection of art, furniture and other items as part of its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture.",
      "Before Friday, the most the association had paid for an artifact was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "The sketches sold Friday are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, according to Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-based auction house that sold them. The series was created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Kristen Wiig steps out of a vintage Rolls-Royce in the opening scene of Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale,\u201d she\u2019s sporting a tall, yellow, fringed hat, gold platform sandals and sunny bell bottoms, with fabric petals that sway with every determined step. It\u2019s the first clue that the costumes on the female-driven comedy are taking center stage.",
      "The Apple TV show made a splash in its first season with the starry cast, high production values and ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail. Wiig\u2019s character, Maxine, tries to break into Palm Beach high society in 1969 and bumps heads with co-stars Carol Burnett, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb and Laura Dern. But also playing a starring role are the vintage designer frocks that reflect each character.",
      "For Season 2, which premiered this week, Emmy-winning costume designer Alix Friedberg says she and her team coordinated \u201cthousands\u201d of looks that reflect the characters\u2019 jet-setting style. She says 50-60% of the brightly colored and graphic print costumes are original vintage designer pieces, sourced by shoppers and costume designers.",
      "\u201cThe looks are so iconic. Sometimes Kristen will walk in in something, and it brings tears to my eyes,\u201d Kaia Gerber \u2014 who plays Mitzi \u2014 told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "If not original vintage, Friedberg\u2019s team builds the costumes, and if a character has to wear an outfit in multiple scenes or in big dance numbers, the team may create duplicates to preserve continuity. Friedberg says she was lucky to find so many vendors with vintage designer pieces in great condition.",
      "\u201c(Bibb\u2019s character) Dinah wears a few original Oscar de la Renta pieces that are really so perfect. Bill Blass was a big one, Oleg Cassini,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that (Janney\u2019s character) Evelyn wears that's this all emerald green jersey, it\u2019s an original Halston and it\u2019s so stunning on her and it really does sort of evoke what\u2019s to come in the '70s.\u201d",
      "Janney calls Friedberg \u201cbrilliant\u201d and marveled at her talent at finding pieces that are like works of art. Some of her favorites were the characters\u2019 apr\u00e8s-ski looks in the Swiss Alps \u2014 but she finds it hard to pick an ultimate favorite.",
      "\u201cAll of them just make me feel divine. And the hair is just a masterpiece, and the makeup \u2014 it all goes together to just create Evelyn and I barely have to do anything,\u201d Janney says.",
      "The costumes also help heighten the comedy. Friedberg says Evelyn\u2019s stoic and deadpan character elicits laughs with some of her over-the-top getups.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s delivering this dialogue, these lines with, like, seven wigs on top of her,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThe absurdity comes out really in how these women present themselves time and time again. \u2026 It was just so much fun to get to laugh and wink at the audience.\u201d",
      "Burnett called costume fittings on the show \u201cgreat fun\u201d and said they helped her find her character, the scheming Norma. \u201cI work from the outside in. I have to know what I\u2019m going to look like,\u201d she says.",

      "The costumes also help set the tone for the female empowerment theme that permeates this season. \u201cEvelyn wore a lot more pants \u2014 which seems ridiculous to say today \u2014 but back then that was a real power move,\u201d Friedberg says.",

      "The BBC has apologized to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it strongly disagreed that there was a basis for a defamation lawsuit",
      "LONDON -- The BBC has issued a public apology to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it \u201cstrongly disagreed there is a basis for a defamation claim.\u201d",
      "Since it was established more than a century ago, Britain's public broadcaster has been no stranger to controversy. Over the past week, it has been embroiled in one of its deepest-ever crisis as its director general stepped down, its head of news quit, questions were raised over the veracity of its journalism and Trump said he is mulling a billion-dollar lawsuit.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Pressure on the broadcaster has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by the BBC's adviser on standards and guidelines on Nov. 3.",
      "As well as criticizing the BBC\u2019s coverage of transgender issues and raising concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service, the dossier said that an edition of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs series \u201cPanorama\" \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election was misleading.",
      "Specifically, it showed how the third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the Jan. 6, 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "By doing so, it made it look like Trump was giving the green light to his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The outcry from opponents of the BBC \u2014 and there are many both in the U.K. and abroad \u2014 was immediate and vociferous.",
      "The broadcaster, which is funded by an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all U.K. households who watch live TV or any BBC content, was accused of bias against Trump, symptomatic of they say an inherent liberal bias within the organization.",
      "For days, the BBC said very little, saying it did not report to leaked reports. Many thought that was a misjudgement as it allowed the narrative around the edit to be led by its opponents.",
      "By Nov. 9, the pressure on the BBC was becoming increasingly acute, prompting its top executive, Tim Davie, and head of news Deborah Turness to resign over what the broadcaster called an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d",
      "It was also revealed that Trump was demanding a retraction, apology and compensation over the sequence. \u201cI guess I have to,\u201d Trump said when asked about whether he would go through with his legal threat. \u201cBecause I think they defrauded the public and they\u2019ve admitted it.\u201d",
      "Trump had set a deadline of Friday, Nov. 14 for the BBC to respond to his challenge.",

      "In a statement, it said its chair, Samir Shah, had personally sent a letter via a letter from its chair over the misleading edit but said it had not defamed him.",
      "While the BBC statement doesn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s demand that he be compensated for \u201coverwhelming financial and reputational harm,\u201d the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation.",
      "The U.S. president has yet to respond to the BBC's apology and its rejection of of his demands for compensation.",
      "Legal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn\u2019t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.",
      "While many legal experts have dismissed the president\u2019s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice.",
      "However this latest crisis pans out in the days and weeks ahead, the heat will remain on the BBC, especially in its newsrooms where any mistake, or seeming bias, will no doubt be picked up opponents.",
      "As a public broadcaster, the BBC has to be impartial in the way it covers news events. It's a fine balancing act that often gets the BBC into trouble.

      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits \u2014 averaging around $190 per person \u2014 to about 42 million people nationwide. During the first couple weeks of November, many of those recipients missed their regular allotments as President Donald Trump's administration battled in court over whether tap into reserves to fund the program while the government was shut down.",

      "At the halfway point of annual United Nations climate negotiations in Brazil, it appears the talks may do more than just focus on implementing past promises, as some observers had expected",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren\u2019t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on \u201cimplementation\u201d of past promises not yet kept.",
      "Throw that out the window.",
      "The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action \u2014 on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",
      "On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.",
      "\u201cThe parties will decide how they want to proceed,\u201d do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.",
      "In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: \u201cEh, could be better but not as bad it could be.\u201d",

      "Reconnecting with old friends can be challenging",
      "NEW YORK -- When Jennifer Austin met Molly in second grade, they quickly became best friends. They giggled through classes until the teacher separated them, inspiring them to come up with their own language. They shared sleepovers and went on each other's family vacations.",
      "But they gradually drifted apart after Austin's family moved to Germany before the girls started high school. Decades passed before they recently reconnected as grown women.",
      "\u201cStrong friendships really do stay for the long haul,\" Austin, 51, said. \"Even if there are pauses in between and they fade, that doesn\u2019t mean they completely dissolve or they go forgotten. They\u2019re always there kind of lingering like a little light in the back.\u201d",
      "Early friendships are some of the deepest: the schoolmates who shared bike rides and their favorite candy. The roommates who offered comfort after breakups. The ones who know us, sometimes better than we know ourselves.",
      "But as adults take on jobs and the responsibilities of homes and families, it can be challenging to stay connected with everyone we've loved.",
      "Technology plays a role, too. Loneliness has increased since the television was invented and intensified with the introduction of smartphones, according to psychologist Marisa Franco, a University of Maryland assistant clinical professor and author of \u201cPlatonic,\u201d a book about the science of attachment.",
      "Once they've lost touch with friends, some people are reluctant to reach out, fearing rejection. But most of those on the receiving end appreciate the effort more than we expect, Franco said.",
      "\u201cPeople are delighted to hear from their old friends and open to connections,\u201d she said.",
      "Franco suggests reminiscing about a shared memory to span the time and distance. It can be something as simple as, \"This pic came up and I just realized I wanted to check in on you,\u201d she said. Propose a meetup. If the friend lives far away, try scheduling a phone date to catch up.",
      "Below, six people who tried to rekindle lost friendships reflect on distance, loss and reconnection.",
      "Heather Robb and Laine DiPasquantonio were nearly inseparable in their 20s, when they both lived in Boston. They went to concerts and vacationed together. DiPasquantonio was there when Robb met her future husband and attended their wedding as a bridesmaid.",
      "But sometime after Robb married and DiPasquantonio moved to Colorado, their circle of friends scattered. They became busy raising children, juggling jobs and caring for aging parents.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible because you don\u2019t know it\u2019s happening,\u201d Robb, 60, said in a joint interview. \u201cI think it was simply space and time. We were all in different cities, we were all in that busy time of toddlers.\u201d",
      "Years passed with occasional holiday cards and texts but few meaningful interactions. DiPasquantonio saw photos on social media of Robb skiing and traveling with other friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure there was so much room for me, from a distance,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAww, I feel badly about that,\u201d Robb replied. \u201cI would argue that's the bad side of social media.\u201d",
      "The women found their way back to each other when Robb, president of Heather Robb Communications, had a business trip to Denver in April. She called to see if DiPasquantonio wanted to get dinner. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if she was going to be that happy to hear from me. I actually had some trepidation in reaching out,\" Robb said.",
      "When she did, Robb learned her friend was about to undergo surgery for breast cancer. Instead of meeting for dinner, DiPasquantonio, a placement specialist at Harmony Senior Referrals, invited Robb to stay for the weekend. A mutual friend flew out to join them.",
      "\u201cI was so tickled that you called and wanted to get together. It was awesome,\u201d DiPasquantonio, 63, said during their interview. \u201cWhat took us so long, right?\u201d",

      "\u201cFriendship and cooking your own food, and exercising and being outside, these are the things that used to be real life, and now I think they\u2019re all fading,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the real issue is time anymore.

      "More than 100,000 people in the U.S. have become allergic to red meat since 2010 because of the syndrome, according to one estimate.",
      "Some outside experts said it appears to be the first documented case of someone suffering a deadly alpha-gal reaction shortly after eating meat.",
      "It's possible other deaths have happened but were assumed to be from other causes and not thoroughly investigated like this one was, said Joshua Benoit, a tick biologist at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson said the agency was not involved in this investigation and could not speak definitively about whether it's the first such death. The CDC recently released a free online training module to increase awareness and improve diagnosing, she added.",
      "Dr. Scott Commins, a leading alpha-gal syndrome researcher at the University of North Carolina, called the death an \u201cunmitigated tragedy.\u201d",
      "\"Totally unnecessary and with increased awareness, this won\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "The case report was published this week in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The lead author was the University of Virginia\u2019s Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, who led the 2011 paper that first linked Lone Star tick bites to the meat allergy.",
      "People with alpha-gal syndrome can experience symptoms including hives, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe stomach pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness and swelling of the lips, throat, tongue or eye lids. Unlike some other food allergies, which occur soon after eating, these reactions typically hit hours later.",
      "The new report tells of a healthy airline pilot who in the summer of 2024 went on a camping trip with his wife and children. They had steak as part of a late supper. That was unusual \u2014 the man rarely ate meat.",

      "The researchers said blood tests revealed evidence of alpha-gal syndrome. Proof that it came from a Lone Star tick is incomplete. The authors made the link based on a statement from the man's wife, who had said he had 12 or 13 \u201cchigger\u201d bites around his ankles earlier in the summer.",
      "But the conclusion makes sense, as people in the eastern U.S. sometimes mistake the bites from mites with those from larval ticks, Commins said.",
      "The number of cases of Alpha-gal syndrome is growing for a variety of reasons, including the Lone Star tick's expanding range, more people coming into contact with the ticks and more doctors learning about it and ordering tests for it.",
      "It can take weeks or longer for infected people to develop the syndrome, which is named for the alpha-gal carbohydrate found in the tick\u2019s saliva. Initial reactions to red meat may be milder but grow progressively more severe, Benoit said.",
      "Some patients have only stomach symptoms, and the American Gastroenterological Association has advised that people with unexplained diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain should be tested for the syndrome.",

      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",
      "A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.",
      "\u201cThe natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\u201d Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.",
      "A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.",
      "Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.",

      "The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.",
      "The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.",
      "There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.",
      "Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.",
      "And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.",
      "Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.",
      "One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder.",

      "\u201cWhat the country is experiencing in terms of morality, values and principles is concerning,\u201d said Feliciano Lacen, spokesperson for the country\u2019s main evangelical organization. \u201cAllowing such depravity publicly and legally sets an unequivocal precedent, which is neither conducive to nor in line with\u2026what we have aspired for the Dominican Republic.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense declined to comment on the ruling, while the National Police said it did not have immediate comment.",

      "Talking to reporters outside the IAEA boardroom, Iran\u2019s Ambassador to the IAEA Reza Najafi denounced Thursday's resolution and said that it was designed to \u201cexert undue pressure on Iran\u201d and propagate a \u201cfalse and misleading narrative of the present situation.\u201d",
      "He described the authors of the resolution as \u201cdeaf and visionless\u201d and said that they maintain \"an arrogant and self-assured posture\" by presuming that Iran is \"obliged to continue its routine cooperation with the agency even under bombardment.\u201d",

      "Last week, Zelenskyy dismissed two top officials and imposed sanctions on close associates after government investigators revealed that $100 million had been embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors.",
      "But that hasn't quieted the political storm. After more than three years of war in which Ukrainians face regular power outages as a result of Russia's fierce bombardment, allegations of corruption in the energy sector aren't sitting well with the public. Calls are growing for Zelenskyy to remove his longtime chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, considered by many to be Ukraine\u2019s de facto vice president.",

      "Ukraine has been plagued by corruption since gaining independence, and Zelenskyy was elected on a mandate to eliminate graft.",
      "Two officials in Zelenskyy's office say the president has not made any decision to dismiss Yermak. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists.",
      "The investigation conducted by Ukraine's anti-corruption watchdogs implicated high-ranking officials with pressuring contractors to pay up to 15% kickbacks in exchange for construction business with Ukraine\u2019s state-owned nuclear energy company, Energoatom.",
      "The investigation involved over 1,000 hours of wiretaps of individuals using code names and cryptic language to discuss the scheme. In some conversations, references were made to a powerful figure operating under the alias \u201cAli Baba,\u201d though this person's identity has not been made public, if it is even known.",
      "After the scheme was made public, Ukraine\u2019s parliament approved Zelenskyy\u2019s dismissal of the energy and justice ministers,. His office imposed sanctions on close associates who were implicated, including Tymur Mindich, a co-owner of Zelenskyy\u2019s media production company.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- South African police and army units held a parade Wednesday involving helicopters, K-9 dog units and officers on motorcycles in a show of force ahead of expected protests around this weekend's Group of 20 world leaders summit in Johannesburg.",
      "South Africa has deployed 3,500 extra police officers and put the army on standby under its National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure \u2014 a body that brings police, army and intelligence services together under one command to provide security for major events.",
      "Deputy national commissioner for policing Lt. Gen. Tebello Mosikili told reporters Tuesday that authorities were expecting protests in Johannesburg and other major South African cities.",

      "South African police said they have designated specific areas for protesters to gather near the summit venue, an exhibition center next to the country's biggest soccer stadium. The head of Airports Company South Africa, which runs the main international airports, said it had set up \u201cspeakers' corners\u201d in airports where protesters would be \u201ckindly\u201d taken by security if they stage demonstrations when world leaders arrive.",
      "The two-day summit opens on Saturday and is expected to attract leaders and top diplomats from more than 40 countries as well as global institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.",
      "Demonstrations are expected from anti-capitalists, climate activists, women's rights campaigners, anti-migrant groups and others, some of which are raising South Africa's own problems with poverty and inequality.",
      "A trade union representing members of South Africa's Afrikaner white minority has already stoked controversy by putting up billboards around Johannesburg that say: \"Welcome to the most RACE-REGULATED country in the world.\" One of the boards was taken down by city authorities, prompting the Afrikaner trade union, Solidarity, to threaten legal action.",
      "The billboards are in reference to South Africa's affirmative action laws that advance opportunities for Black people and have become part of a diplomatic fallout between South Africa and the United States.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump won't attend the G20 summit in a boycott over his claims that South Africa's Black-led government is pursuing racist, anti-white policies and violently persecuting its Afrikaner minority. Trump's claims have been widely rejected as baseless, but the U.S. government boycott threatens to undermine the first G20 summit in Africa.",
      "Other groups hope to use the opportunity to draw attention to a myriad of issues.",
      "The Women for Change advocacy group is calling for a national shutdown on Friday, the eve of the summit. It is asking women to boycott work on the day in protest at South Africa's extremely high rates of violence against women and femicide.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- GE Appliances on Thursday touted wide-ranging ripple effects from shifting production from China to Kentucky as it announced more than $150 million in new contracts awarded to U.S.-based suppliers.",
      "The supplier contracts range in value from $330,000 to $41 million, span 10 states and cover crucial segments of the supplier chain for the appliance maker's washer and dryer production \u2014 from plastics and castings to steel and aluminum, the company said. The suppliers range in size from U.S. Steel to family-owned companies.",
      "With the new contracts, GE Appliances said it is increasing domestic spending on suppliers by 3.3%.",
      "The suppliers will support production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers, all of which GE Appliances is moving from China to its sprawling Louisville complex known as Appliance Park. The company says it's investing $490 million to retool a plant for the project, which will create 800 new jobs.",
      "Production is scheduled to begin in early 2027, it said, and will expand the total footprint devoted to clothes care production at Appliance Park to the equivalent of 33 football fields.",
      "\u201cWhen we invest in U.S. manufacturing and our people, it drives growth far beyond our own walls,\u201d Lee Lagomarcino, a GE Appliances vice president, said Thursday in a news release. \u201cThese new supplier contracts represent what \u2018Built for America\u2019 is all about \u2014 investing in U.S. manufacturing, creating more American jobs and building opportunity that multiplies.\u201d",
      "The announcements come as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods. The president recently said the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47%.",

      "GE Appliances said it spends $4.6 billion with more than 6,500 U.S. suppliers, a 69% increase in spending and a 58% rise in its number of suppliers since 2019. Its U.S. supply chain has grown for more than a decade, it said.",
      "\"While tariffs have certainly been a factor, there are also many other benefits such as shorter lead times, reduced transportation costs and the ability to collaborate with your supply chain to ultimately serve our customers better,\u201d Lagomarcino said.",
      "The new contracts were awarded to businesses in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Alabama and California, GE Appliances said. It awarded more than $40 million in contracts to suppliers in Kentucky, more than in any other state.",
      "The contracts are the first of many expected ripple effects from its broader, five-year, $3 billion commitment to strengthen its U.S. manufacturing, reshore certain production and create more than 1,000 jobs, the company said. GE Appliances announced plans in August to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico. The company also has manufacturing plants in South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Connecticut. The company is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",

      "MILAN -- MILAN (AP) \u2014 Prada heir Lorenzo Bertelli will have a major strategic role as executive chairman of Versace after the Prada Group completes its 1.25 billion-euro ($1.4 billion) deal to buy its rival, expected in the coming weeks, the Prada Group confirmed Thursday.",
      "Bertelli, 37, has been previously announced as the future leader of the Prada Group, where he has been marketing director since 2019 and head of corporate responsibility since 2020. The elder son of acclaimed designer Miuccia Prada and Prada Group chairman Patrizio Bertelli joined the group in 2017 as head of digital communication.",
      "Bertelli made the announcement about his next role on an Italian-language Bloomberg podcast Wednesday.",
      "He said he doesn\u2019t expect any big shake-ups at Versace at least for the first year after the acquisition is complete as he gets to know the company and its executive team. But he underlined that the 47-year-old fashion house founded by the late Gianni Versace has been underperforming its potential.",
      "\u201cThe brand is much bigger than the revenue that it is generating,\u2019\u2019 Bertelli said, noting that Versace remains among the top global fashion brands.",

      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \u201cso we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\u201d",

Futures were already higher on enthusiasm for a strong earnings report from AI bellwether Nvidia. Futures for the S&P 500 were up 1.5% before the opening bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%. Futures for the Nasdaq shot 1.9% higher. The Labor Department said employapners added 119,000 jobs in September, more than double the 50,000 economists had forecast. The market also focused on Nvidia as Wall Street\u2019s most influential company jumped 5.1% overnight after reporting better-than-expected results.",

      "The Santa Clara, California company also forecast revenue for the current quarter covering November-January will come in at about $65 billion, nearly $3 billion above analysts\u2019 projections, an indication that demand for its AI chips remains feverish.",
      "Nvidia is the most valuable company by market capitalization on Wall Street, having briefly topped $5 trillion in value. That means its movements have more of an effect on the S&P 500 than any other stock, and it can single-handedly steer the index\u2019s direction some days.",
      "By continuing to deliver big profits for investors, Nvidia has mostly quieted recent criticism that its shares shot too high, too fast.",
      "Nvidia has become a bellwether for the broader frenzy around artificial-intelligence  technology, because other companies are using its chips to ramp up their AI efforts.",

      "With other retailers dialing back projections, the nation\u2019s largest retailer raised its financial outlook Thursday after its strong third quarter, setting itself up for a strong holiday shopping season.",
      "Traders also made their final moves ahead of a September jobs report coming from the U.S. government on Thursday. The labor market data, usually released during the first week of every month, was delayed due to the six-week federal government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department said Wednesday that it will not be releasing a full jobs report for October because the 43-day shutdown meant it couldn\u2019t calculate the unemployment rate and some other key numbers.",
      "The job market has been slowing enough this year that the Fed has already cut its main interest rate twice. Lower rates can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, and the expectation on Wall Street had been for more cuts, including at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in December.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. employers added a surprisingly solid 119,000 jobs in September, the government said, issuing a key economic report that had been delayed for seven weeks by the federal government shutdown.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in September, highest since October 2021 and up from 4.3% in August, the Labor Department said Thursday. The unemployment rate rose partly because 470,000 people entered the labor market \u2014 either working or looking for work \u2014 in September and not all of them found jobs right away.",
      "The increase in payrolls was more than double the 50,000 economists had forecast. But Labor Department revisions showed that the economy lost 4,000 jobs in August instead of gaining 22,000 as originally reported. Altogether, revisions shaved 33,000 jobs off July and August payrolls.",
      "Healthcare and social assistance firms added more than 57,000 jobs in September, construction companies 19,000 and retailers almost 14,000. But factories shed 6,000 jobs and the federal government lost 3,000.",
      "Average hourly wages rose just 0.2% from August and 3.8% from a year earlier, edging closer to the 3.5% year-over-year increase that the Federal Reserve's inflation fighters like to see.",
      "During the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, investors, businesses, policymakers and the Federal Reserve were groping in the dark for clues about the health of the American job market because federal workers had been furloughed and couldn't collect the data.",
      "The report comes at a time of considerable uncertainty about the economy. The job market has been strained by the lingering effects of high interest rates and uncertainty around Trump\u2019s erratic campaign to slap taxes on imports from almost every country on earth. But economic growth at midyear was resilient.",
      "Fed policymakers are divided over whether to cut interest rates for the third time this year when they meet next month.",
      "Economists expected to see a continuation of what was happening in the spring and summer: weak hiring but few layoffs, an awkward pairing that means Americans who have work mostly enjoy job security \u2013 but those who don\u2019t often struggle to find employment.",
      "The job market has been strained this year by the lingering effects of high interest rates engineered to fight a 2021-2022 spike in inflation and uncertainty around Trump\u2019s campaign to slap taxes on imports from almost every country on earth and on specific products \u2014 from copper to foreign films.",
      "Labor Department revisions in September showed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year that ended in March. That meant that employers added an average of just 71,000 new jobs a month over that period, not the 147,000 first reported.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration is expected to reduce the number of people looking for work, which means that the economy can create fewer jobs without sending the unemployment rate higher.",
      "With September numbers out, businesses, investors, policymakers and the Fed will have to wait awhile to get another good look at the numbers behind the American labor market.",
      "The Labor Department said Wednesday that it won\u2019t won't release a full jobs report for October because it couldn't calculate the unemployment rate during the government shutdown.",
      "Instead, it will release some of the October jobs data \u2014 including the number of jobs that employers created last month \u2014 along with the full November jobs report on Dec. 16, a couple of weeks late.",
      "That puts an even more intense focus on September jobs numbers released Thursday. They are the last full measurement of hiring and unemployment that Fed policymakers will see before they meet Dec. 9-10 to decide whether to cut their benchmark interest rate for the third time this year.",

      "Greystar, the nation\u2019s largest landlord, has reached a $7 million settlement with nine states that sued the property management giant for using rent-setting algorithms that officials have blamed for driving up housing costs.",
      "The proposed settlement, filed Tuesday in a North Carolina federal court, is the latest to result from antitrust lawsuits targeting RealPage and similar software companies. Prosecutors argue the products help rival property managers illegally align prices and push up rents. A judge must still approve the deal.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s through smoke-filled backroom deals or through an algorithm on your computer screen, colluding to drive up prices is illegal,\u201d Democratic California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a news release. \u201cFamilies across the country are staring down an affordability crisis. Companies that intentionally fuel this unaffordability by raising prices to line their own pockets can be sure I will use the full force of my office to hold them accountable.\u201d",
      "As part of the settlement, Greystar will no longer use software that relies on other landlords\u2019 confidential data to set rents. Greystar also agreed separately last month to pay $50 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over its use of RealPage. And in August, the company reached a separate nonmonetary deal with the Department of Justice to halt similar practices.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased this matter is resolved and remain focused on serving our residents and clients,\u201d Greystar said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Based in South Carolina, Greystar manages more than 946,000 units nationwide, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council. RealPage, which is based in Texas, has said its software is used on fewer than 10% of rental units in the U.S., and that its price recommendations are used less than half the time. It did not have a comment on the latest settlement.",

      "The changes include the elimination of the Fish and Wildlife Service's \u201cblanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants newly classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process.",
      "Environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the monarch butterfly, Florida manatee, California spotted owl and North American wolverine.",
      "\u201cWe would have to wait until these poor animals are almost extinct before we can start protecting them. That\u2019s absurd and heartbreaking,\u201d said Stephanie Kurose with the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The proposals come as extinctions have accelerated globally because of habitat loss and other pressures. Prior proposals during Trump's second term would revise the definition of \u201charm\u201d under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \u201cthe livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\u201d",
      "The changes answer longstanding calls for revisions to the 1973 Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. Those critics argue the law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth.",

      "The return of Brazil\u2019s president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to UN climate talks was hoped to spur nations to meet a self-imposed early deadline for progress on tough issues",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- The arrival of Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva at U.N. climate talks on Wednesday was hoped to spur nations to meet a self-imposed early deadline for progress on tough issues. For now, it hasn't worked.",
      "In a news conference late Wednesday, Lula skipped over any update on the status of talks. Instead, he renewed his earlier calls for action, making the case to delegates that the world must reduce its use of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal.",
      "\"We haven\u2019t found another place to live,\u201d Lula, flanked by Brazilian negotiators and his wife, said.",
      "Lula and several other leaders are pushing to create a road map toward transition to renewable energies. But in his remarks Wednesday, he was careful to say there's no intention to \u201cimpose anything on anybody,\u201d that countries could transition at their own pace and count on financial help to do so.",
      "Lula's return to the talks, along with the presence of U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, had stirred some optimism that COP30, as the talks are known, would move forward more quickly ahead of Friday's scheduled wrap up. Host Brazil had pushed for progress on some key issues Wednesday, but it's routine for negotiators at these talks to miss deadlines.",
      "COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago had given negotiators a Wednesday deadline for a decision on four interconnected issues that were initially excluded from the official agenda: whether countries should be told to toughen their new climate plans; details on handing out $300 billion in pledged climate aid; dealing with trade barriers over climate and improving reporting on transparency and climate progress.",
      "Scores of countries, rich and poor, are also pushing for a detailed road map on how to phase out fossil fuels. And that's key to toughening new climate plans for a shot at limiting future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the global goal set in 2015's Paris Agreement.",
      "In 2023, after days of contentious debate, climate talks agreed to language calling for a transition away from fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil and natural gas. But little has been done since to clarify or amplify on that one sentence. Protesters inside and outside the conference venue kept pushing for a phaseout.",
      "A group of scientists Wednesday criticized current proposals for a fossil fuel phaseout road map as inadequate, particularly to reach the goal of zero fossil fuel emissions by 2045 at the latest.",
      "\u201cA road map is not a workshop or a ministerial meeting. A road map is a real workplan that needs to show us the way from where we are to where we need to be, and how to get there,\u201d said a letter from seven prominent scientists, including some who are advising the COP30 presidency.",
      "Lula, in talking to leaders earlier in Belem, boosted the efforts of clarifying how to wean the world from the fuels that emit heat-trapping gases, the chief cause of climate change.",
      "The Brazilian president has also been pushing for more participation in a new multibillion international fund financed by interest-bearing debt instead of donations, called the Tropical Forests Forever Facility. It seeks to make it more lucrative for governments to keep their trees rather than cut them down.",
      "Iskander Erzini Vernoit, director of the IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, an independent think-tank based in Morocco, said it won't be easy for Guterres and Lula to find common ground among negotiators.",
      "\u201cVarious apparent impasses still remain, and chief among these from an African point of view is the unwillingness of the EU and other rich countries to engage on their obligation to provide climate finance,\" Erzini Vernoit said.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.",
      "In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.",
      "Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.",
      "Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.",
      "China\u2019s trucking fleet, the world\u2019s second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and \"in other countries, it might never take off,\u201d he said.",
      "The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.",
      "While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle\u2019s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,\u201d Doleman said.",
      "Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.",
      "Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.",
      "Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.",
      "CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering 150,000 kilometers (about 93,000 miles) out of China's 184,000 kms (about 114,000 miles) of expressways.",
      "The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.",
      "Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "\u201cThe rise of China\u2019s electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,\u201d said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.",

      "Shell\u2019s 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world\u2019s largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India.",

      "A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.",

      "New York City's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, has quickly become a target of conservative media figures",
      "New York City's incoming mayor, Zohran Mamdani, hasn't taken office yet. But he's already the new avatar of evil for conservative media figures.",
      "He's been called \u201cdownright sinister\u201d and \u201cincompatible with America.\u201d His labels include commie, Marxist, jihadist sympathizer and \u201cseething leftist.\u201d Fox News' Laura Ingraham warned her viewers not to be fooled by \u201csmiling socialists who rule like Soviet tyrants.\u201d",
      "A New York Post post-election cover that depicted Mamdani holding aloft the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle symbol sold out on newsstands by noon and was offered on e-Bay for $75. By the end of the day, the Post was selling baby onesies and commemorative plates emblazoned with the cover.",
      "Already, conservative outlets see Mamdani joining Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton as someone guaranteed to make their audiences' blood boil. And by doing so, they can help Republicans in the midterm elections.",
      "\u201cIt's very clear that he's going to be the No. 1 target of right-wing media for the foreseeable future, well into 2026,\u201d said Howard Polskin, publisher of the Righting, a newsletter that follows conservative media. \u201cHe's colorful, controversial and not afraid of a fight.\u201d",
      "The head of an outlet that Polskin regularly monitors, the Daily Signal, said Mamdani is likely seen as a threat because his appeal to working-class Americans who feel left behind by the economy is similar to that of President Donald Trump, although they have different ideas about how to handle that.",
      "\u201cRemember years ago there was Nancy Pelosi who was the bogeyman for Republicans,\u201d said Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of the Daily Signal. \u201cI think Mamdani is probably going to be the new person. I think that\u2019s why you see a lot of emphasis on him in conservative media.\u201d",
      "In the Washington Examiner, editor-in-chief Hugo Gurdon saw ominous signs in Mamdani's election night victory speech. \u201cHe was downright sinister, glorying not just in his achievement but in having laid low his vanquished enemies and stuck it to others besides. He took off his smiling campaign mask and revealed his venomous self,\u201d Gurdon wrote.",
      "Newsmax's Rob Schmitt called Mamdani the \u201cmayor for the foreign-born. We have flooded the country with diversity, and diversity delivered us Zohran.\" In an interview, Schmitt said he wasn't quite ready to anoint Mamdani as a deliberate target for the conservative media.",
      "\u201cA go-to bogeyman makes it sound like it's manufactured,\u201d he told The Associated Press, \u201cwhereas we are just appropriately concerned about people that are spewing or trying to push an ideology that is destined to not work.\u201d",
      "The Post recognized Mamdani as a target of interest well before the election. Between Oct. 27 and Nov. 5, he was the subject of seven of the tabloid's covers. One, headlined \u201cMam-Child,\" depicted Mamdani in a little boy's overalls to illustrate a column warning that the city wasn't a toy to hand to a \u201cbaby like Zohran.\u201d Another front page blared \u201cNot Zo Fast\u201d to herald a tightening race in the polls. Election Day's lead headline was \u201cTrump to New York: Keep the Commie Out.\u201d",
      "Mamdani reached out to the White House post-election for a meeting with Trump and the president said Sunday that \u201cwe'll work something out.\u201d",
      "Mamdani\u2019s status as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and his Muslim background are behind many of the conservative media attacks.",
      "Asked on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this spring whether he was a communist, Mamdani said, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d Webster's defines socialism as a political theory where the community or government owns and controls the production and distribution of goods. Communism, advanced by revolutionary Karl Marx, is considered a step beyond, where private property and capitalism no longer exist.",

He's far worse than a socialist.\u201d",
      "Some Jewish groups have expressed skepticism about Mamdani, who has supported Palestinian rights and criticized Israel's attack in Gaza as genocide. But he has denounced Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and said he will work to combat antisemitism.",
      "Republicans have a clear interest in seeing more American Jews \u2014 traditionally a group that leans toward Democrats \u2014 switch over. But that doesn't account for some of the hostility seen in the media.",
      "The National Review said Mamdani's win meant \u201cit's open season on New York Jews.\u201d Megyn Kelly said the tenets of Islam are inconsistent with American values and Muslims should not be elected mayors or governors. Podcaster Michael Savage called him a \u201cMarxist jihadist sympathizer.\u201d Influencer Laura Loomer predicted Mamdani would encourage Muslims to commit political assassinations to acquire power and silence critics.",
      "Mamdani's staff did not return messages from The Associated Press. In the waning days of his campaign, he spoke out against some of the religious-based attacks on him.",
      "\u201cI thought that if I behaved well enough or bit my tongue enough in the face or racist, baseless attacks all while returning back to my central message, it would allow me to be more than just my faith,\u201d he said. \u201cI was wrong. No amount of redirection is ever enough.\u201d",
      "Some of the attacks reflect a common theme in politics and the media \u2014 not unique to Mamdani \u2014 to associate all members of a political party with the beliefs of one who could be depicted as on the fringe. The Daily Signal wrote after his election that Mamdani \u201cis now the putative leader of his party.\u201d",
      "The Victory Girls conservative blog used an illustration of the incoming mayor in a military uniform. \"The socialists are coming, and Mamdani is just the beginning,\u201d the blog wrote. \u201cIf we ignore them, we will all be in big trouble.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe's the new AOC in the sense that they have found someone who is relatively unknown that they get to define and hold up as the example of what it means to be a Democrat,\u201d said Angelo Carusone, president of the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America.",
      "Carusone said he's not sure if Mamdani will become a villain of the conservative media on the level of a Clinton or Pelosi, but he can understand the urgency.",
      "\u201cIf you don't check him now,\" Carusone said, \u201che's going to capture the young people.\"",

      "The flight disruptions during the record government shutdown have inspired a rare act of bipartisanship",
      "The flight disruptions during the record government shutdown that ended last week inspired a rare act of bipartisanship in Washington on Tuesday, when congressional representatives from both parties introduced legislation that would allow air traffic controllers to get paid during future shutdowns.",
      "The bill proposes funding salaries, operating expenses and other Federal Aviation Administration programs by tapping into a little-used fund with $2.6 billion that was created to reimburse airlines if the government commandeers their planes and they are damaged. The bill's sponsors, which include four of the top Republicans and Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, hope that relying on the fund might make their bill more attractive than other proposals because it would limit the potential cost of dolling out paychecks.",
      "U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, the GOP chairman of the committee, said in a statement that the bill would help keep the traveling public safe during future shutdowns. The other sponsors include Democratic U.S. Reps. Rick Larsen of Washington and Andre Carson of Indiana, along with Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, who leads the aviation subcommittee.",
      "\u201cWe all saw that the system can be vulnerable when Congress can\u2019t get its job done,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThis bill guarantees that controllers, who have one of the most high-pressure jobs in the nation, will get paid during any future funding lapses and that air traffic control, aviation safety, and the traveling public will never again be negatively impacted by shutdowns.\u201d",
      "The bill\u2019s introduction comes ahead of a scheduled hearing Wednesday by a Senate subcommittee to examine the impacts of the 43-day shutdown on aviation.",
      "But it's not clear whether this bill \u2014 or any similar proposals that have been floating around Congress since the 2019 shutdown \u2014 will have a chance to get approved before the next government funding deadline at the end of January. Nearly all the other proposals, including one from U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, would rely on the aviation trust fund that collects money from fees the airlines pay, and the Congressional Budget Office has given those bills a much higher price tag.",
      "Over the years, lawmakers have tried a handful of fixes for a long-term solution to keep air traffic controllers and other essential aviation workers paid during funding lapses. The proposals often gained bipartisan attention, especially after the 35-day shutdown that ended in 2019 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, but none made it over the finish line.",
      "Moran's bill, known as the Aviation Funding Stability Act, for example, is a recurring proposal in Congress that would allow the FAA to tap into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Lawmakers in both chambers have reintroduced versions of it over the years, including in 2019 and 2021.",
      "The legislation resurfaced in March when Moran, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Aviation, Space, and Innovation, put it forward. It came up again in September, weeks before the shutdown began, when Carson and U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, also a Democrat, introduced it in the House.",
      "The new bill introduced Tuesday would cut off the money if the insurance fund dips below $1 billion. But Transportation Committee staffers estimate that would still provide enough funding to keep FAA operating for four to six weeks.",
      "The issue gets so much attention because of all the flight delays and cancellations that happen during a shutdown as more air traffic controllers call out of work. The existing shortage of controllers is so severe that just a few absences in an airport tower or other FAA radar facilities can cause problems.",

      "For a time it was also used for an insurance fund at a time when airlines were having trouble getting any insurance coverage after 9/11. For years, airlines paid into the fund regularly to get coverage from the government.",
      "But by the early 2010s the insurance market for airlines had stabilized. Congress let the insurance program expire at the end of 2014.",

      "The U.S. Department of Energy says it's loaning $1 billion to help finance the restart of the nuclear power plant on Pennsylvania\u2019s Three Mile Island to supply power to data centers for tech giant Microsoft",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The U.S. Department of Energy said Tuesday that it will loan $1 billion to help finance the restart of the nuclear power plant on Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island that is under contract to supply power to data centers for tech giant Microsoft.",
      "The loan is in line with the priorities of President Donald Trump's administration, including bolstering nuclear power and artificial intelligence.",
      "For Constellation Energy, which owns Three Mile Island's lone functioning nuclear power reactor, the federal loan will lower its financing cost to get the mothballed plant up and running again. The 835-megawatt reactor can power the equivalent of approximately 800,000 homes, the Department of Energy said.",
      "The reactor had been out of operation for five years when Constellation Energy announced last year that it would spend $1.6 billion to restart it under a 20-year agreement with Microsoft to buy the power for its data centers.",
      "Constellation Energy renamed the functioning unit the Crane Clean Energy Center as it works to restore equipment including the turbine, generator, main power transformer and cooling and control systems. It hopes to bring the plant back online in 2027.",
      "The loan is being issued under an existing $250 billion energy infrastructure program initially authorized by Congress in 2022. Neither the department nor Constellation released terms of the loan.",
      "The plant, on an island in the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, was the site of the nation\u2019s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The accident destroyed one reactor, Unit 2, and left the plant with one functioning reactor, Unit 1.",

      "Colombian scientists have recovered a cannon, three coins and a porcelain cup from the Caribbean Sea",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- A cannon, three coins and a porcelain cup were among the first objects Colombian scientists recovered from the depths of the Caribbean Sea where the mythical Spanish galleon San Jos\u00e9 sank in 1708 after being attacked by an English fleet, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The recovery is part of a scientific investigation that the government authorized last year to study the wreckage and the causes of the sinking. Colombian researchers located the galleon in 2015, leading to legal and diplomatic disputes. Its exact location is a state secret.",
      "The ship is believed to hold 11 million gold and silver coins, emeralds and other precious cargo from Spanish-controlled colonies, which could be worth billions of dollars if ever recovered.",
      "President Gustavo Petro's government has said that the purpose of the deep-water expedition is research and not the treasure\u2019s seizure.",
      "Colombia's culture ministry said in a statement Thursday that the cannon, coins and porcelain cup will undergo a conservation process at a lab dedicated to the expedition.",

      "Meta has started notifying young Australians to download their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram, and Threads",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Technology giant Meta on Thursday began sending thousands of young Australians a two-week warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect.",
      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \u201cso we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\u201d",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia\u2019s population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \u201cvideo selfie,\u201d Meta said.",

      "\u201cIn the absence of a government-mandated ID system, we\u2019re always looking at second-best solutions around these things,\u201d Flew told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Failure to take reasonable steps to exclude young children could earn platforms fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($32 million).",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over \u2014 often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement\u2019s radar.",
      "Once limited to policing the nation\u2019s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country\u2019s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans\u2019 daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "\u2018We did everything right and had nothing to hide\u2019",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens\u2019 social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.",
      "In Schott\u2019s case, Babb testified that federal agents \u201cactually watch travel patterns on the highway\u201d through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: \u201cI just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.\u201d",
      "After finding nothing in Schott\u2019s car, Babb said \u201cnine times out of 10, this is what happens,\u201d a phrase Schott\u2019s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff\u2019s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.",
      "The Bexar County sheriff\u2019s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county\u2019s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "\u2018Patterns of life\u2019 and license plates",
      "Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation\u2019s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.",
      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, \u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual, I mean extremely unusual, to just complain of a problem with autobiographical memory,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOne has to think about unusual disorders.\u201d",

      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "Another company, Miko, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make its product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",

      "Ritvik Sharma, the company's senior vice president of growth, said Miko actually \u201cencourages kids to interact more with their friends, to interact more with the peers, with the family members etc. It\u2019s not made for them to feel attached to the device only.\u201d",
      "Still, Suskind and children's advocates say analog toys are a better bet for the holidays.",

A simple block set or a teddy bear that doesn\u2019t talk back forces a child to invent stories, experiment, and work through problems. AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

      "A museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin has opened at the Christ Cathedral campus in Garden Grove, California",
      "GARDEN GROVE, Calif. -- An interactive museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin, which some say was Jesus\u2019 burial cloth, opens its doors to the public Wednesday at the Christ Cathedral campus in Southern California.",
      "\u201cThe Shroud of Turin: An Immersive Experience,\u201d a $5-million exhibit in Garden Grove featuring 360-degree projection room theaters, Shroud of Turin replicas, interactive kiosks, and a life-size sculpture of Christ, was conceived over a span of three years and funded through private donations.",
      "The content was created primarily by Othonia, Inc., a Rome-based group dedicated to the examination of the shroud, one of the most studied artifacts in history. The original \u2014 a 14-foot-long, 3.5-foot-wide (4.3-meter-long, 1 meter-wide) cloth \u2014 is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case housed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.",
      "The California museum \u2014 covering 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) \u2014 contains a life-size laminated visual of the shroud stretched over a wall. It shows the faint image of a man with wounds similar to those of Christ.",
      "The Vatican has called the cloth a powerful symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

      "For technology adopters looking for the next big thing, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is the future. At least, that's what the marketing pitches and tech industry T-shirts say.",
      "What makes an artificial intelligence product \u201cagentic\u201d depends on who's selling it. But the promise is usually that it's a step beyond today's generative AI chatbots.",
      "Chatbots, however useful, are all talk and no action. They can answer questions, retrieve and summarize information, write papers and generate images, music, video and lines of code. AI agents, by contrast, are supposed to be able to take actions on a person's behalf.",
      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

      "Dietterich has some quibbles with certain companies using \u201cagentic\u201d to describe \u201cany action a computer might do, including just looking things up on the web,\u201d but he has no doubt that the technology has immense possibilities as AI systems are given the \u201cfreedom and responsibility\u201d to refine goals and respond to changing conditions as they work on people's behalf.",

Tambe said he's been \u201camused\u201d by the sudden popularity of \u201cagentic\u201d as an adjective. Previously, the word describing something that has agency was mostly found in other academic fields, such as psychology or chemistry.",
      "But computer scientists have been debating what an agent is for as long as Tambe has been studying them.",
      "In the 1990s, \u201cpeople agreed that some software appeared more like an agent, and some felt less like an agent, and there was not a perfect dividing line,\u201d said Tambe, a professor at Harvard University. \u201cNonetheless, it seemed useful to use the word \u2018agent\u2019 to describe software or robotic entities acting autonomously in an environment, sensing the environment, reacting to it, planning, thinking.\u201d",
      "The prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng, co-founder of online learning company Coursera, helped advocate for popularizing the adjective \u201cagentic\u201d more than a year ago to encompass a broader spectrum of AI tasks. At the time, he also appreciated that mainly \u201ctechnical people\u201d were describing it that way.",

      "Hawaii officials, for example, are giving away 1,000 dashboard cameras as they try to reverse a recent spike in traffic fatalities. The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",

      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",

      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",
      "\u201cBetter data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,\u201d the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.",

      "States also are trying to do more to find out what\u2019s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.",
      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.",
      "PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.",

      "The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.",

In his review, Kennedy called \u201cThe Roses\u201d \u201can escalating hatefest that, by the time a loaded gun comes out, all the fun has been sucked out.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A team of researchers has uncovered what they say is the first reported use of artificial intelligence to direct a hacking campaign in a largely automated fashion.",
      "The AI company Anthropic said this week that it disrupted a cyber operation that its researchers linked to the Chinese government. The operation involved the use of an artificial intelligence system to direct the hacking campaigns, which researchers called a disturbing development that could greatly expand the reach of AI-equipped hackers.",
      "While concerns about the use of AI to drive cyber operations are not new, what is concerning about the new operation is the degree to which AI was able to automate some of the work, the researchers said.",
      "\u201cWhile we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale,\" they wrote in their report.",
      "The operation was modest in scope and only targeted about 30 individuals who worked at tech companies, financial institutions, chemical companies and government agencies. Anthropic noticed the operation in September and took steps to shut it down and notify the affected parties.",
      "The hackers only \u201csucceeded in a small number of cases,\u201d according to Anthropic, which noted that while AI systems are increasingly being used in a variety of settings for work and leisure, they can also be weaponized by hacking groups working for foreign adversaries. Anthropic, maker of the generative AI chatbot Claude, is one of many tech companies pitching AI \u201cagents\u201d that go beyond a chatbot's capability to access computer tools and take actions on a person's behalf.",

    "story": [
      "At least one witness has been subpoenaed regarding the conduct, sources said.",
      "The Department of Justice is probing the conduct of at least two top Trump administration officials for allegedly interfering with and potentially jeopardizing the ongoing criminal investigations of the president's political adversaries, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "Sources said the DOJ and FBI are scrutinizing whether U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte enlisted individuals outside the Department of Justice to probe allegations of mortgage fraud amid ongoing investigations of Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "At least one witness in the Schiff investigation has received a grand jury subpoena to hand over any correspondence with Martin's associates as well as with Pulte himself, sources told ABC News.",
      "In what would be an extraordinary breach of DOJ protocol, Martin is also believed to have shared sensitive grand jury information about the James case with at least one unauthorized individual as well as worked with another person from outside the federal government to examine potential evidence in the Schiff and James probes, sources familiar with the matter said.",
      "At least one witness in the Schiff investigation has received a grand jury subpoena to hand over any correspondence with Martin's associates as well as with Pulte himself, sources told ABC News.",
      "Senior Trump administration officials have expressed concerns that the potential misconduct may have compromised the investigations and jeopardized the viability of the cases if they proceed to trial.",
      "While Attorney General Pam Bondi tapped Martin as a \"special attorney\" for mortgage fraud, officials say the alleged rogue conduct -- operating outside of the two U.S. attorneys' offices investigating the cases and usurping the FBI agents assigned to the cases -- violates DOJ guidelines and necessitates a full review of Martin's conduct to determine what would need to be disclosed to defense lawyers.",
      "FBI agents working on the Schiff case discovered the potential problem when they sought to interview Christine Bish, a California politician and realtor who first publicized the allegations of mortgage fraud against Schiff. When FBI agents first made contact with her, Bish expressed confusion about why federal investigators sought to speak with her again, telling agents that she had repeatedly spoken with a man she believed worked for the Department of Justice as Ed Martin's lead investigator, sources said.",
      "Bish told FBI agents that Robert Bowes -- who has publicly claimed to be a financial fraud expert with the Office of Personnel Management assigned to work with the Department of Justice on mortgage fraud matters -- reached out to her a month earlier via a direct message on X to request an interview, according to sources.",
      "Without the knowledge of the FBI or Maryland prosecutors, Bowes spoke with Bish -- who is thought to be a central witness in the Schiff case -- on multiple occasions during which she provided information on the case, sources said.",
      "A man named Scott Strauss -- a private citizen who is believed to be working with Martin -- also reached out to Bish to request that she send the documents about Schiff to a private email address, which she declined to do because the request appeared suspicious, the sources said.",
      "Bish, sources said, also told investigators that Pulte had reached out to her directly in July to request the documentation related to her complaint -- just days before President Trump shared some of the documentation on social media to claim that Schiff \"should be prosecuted.\" \u00a0Pulte has played a central role in the criminal investigations of Trump's opponents -- issuing criminal referrals against James, Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook -- and recently dismissed Fannie Mae watchdogs who were probing how he obtained the mortgage records.",
      "An aide to Martin referred ABC News to the Justice Department's press office for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department told ABC News, \"Anonymous sources seeking to spin or influence ongoing processes do a disservice to the public and to the rule of law.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Pulte, Strauss, and Bish did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News. An attorney for Schiff did not respond to a request for comment. Attorneys for James declined to comment.",
      "'She knows I'm a lunatic'",
      "The concerns about Pulte and Martin's conduct come as the Department of Justice has accelerated its efforts to investigate and prosecute President Trump's perceived political foes. Following a public pressure campaign from the president, a Trump-installed U.S. attorney indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey over the objections of prosecutors who sources said expressed serious concerns with both cases, sources said. Investigators in Maryland continue to probe Schiff for alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "All three have denied all allegations against them, and Comey and James pleaded not guilty after they were charged. Defense lawyers have challenged the cases against James and Comey by arguing they would have never been brought had their clients not been vocal critics of President Trump.",
      "James, speaking outside the courthouse following her arraignment, said the justice system under President Trump is being \"used as a tool of revenge\" and is nothing but a \"vehicle of retribution.\"",
      "Attorneys for Schiff have called the investigation \"politically motivated\" and \"unsupported by any evidence.\"",
      "Prosecutors have not publicly commented on the Schiff matter, but sources say investigators have so far struggled to identify a viable case, in part because the mortgage documents in question are well past the statute of limitations.",
      "After a controversial tenure as the interim U.S. attorney in D.C. when he failed to secure enough Republican support to be confirmed to the permanent position, Martin has only further embraced his status as a partisan warrior for President Trump.",
      "\"Attorney General Bondi has been fearless in encouraging me. Like she knows I'm a lunatic -- like a wild man -- and she [says] keep going, keep going,\" Martin recently said on a conservative radio show.",
      "Holding four separate titles -- pardon attorney, special attorney for mortgage fraud, associate deputy attorney general, and director of the DOJ's 'Weaponization Working Group' -- Martin has often suggested in interviews that he has the full backing of the DOJ leadership, though his self-described \"name and shame\" approach has resulted in multiple instances of him being privately rebuked by leadership or forced to retract his actions.",
      "Earlier this year, Martin posed for a photoshoot with the New York Post outside the Brooklyn home of Letitia James. Days earlier, he sent a letter to James' attorney to recommend she resign from office amid his investigation for \"the good of the state and nation.\" His photoshoot and social media post later earned Martin a rebuke from Attorney General Bondi, as previously reported by ABC News.",

      "\"If they can be charged, we'll charge them,\" Martin said before stepping down as the interim U.S. attorney in D.C. \"But if they can't be charged, we will name them. And we will name them, and in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are ashamed.\"",
      "'I started digging'",
      "While Martin was named the special attorney for mortgage fraud, prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland have been leading the investigation into whether Schiff committed mortgage fraud related to the purchase of his home in Maryland.",
      "The investigation itself began with a complaint from Bish -- a Republican who is running to represent California's Sixth District in Congress -- who alleged that Schiff falsely listed his Maryland home as his \"primary residence\" on mortgage documents, despite declaring a condo in California as his primary residence.",
      "\"I started digging and pulled all of their mortgage documents,\" Bish said in an interview last year with Mike Huckabee. \"We start looking and seeing all the things that Adam Schiff has been doing, I had to pick the monster, and clearly that is Adam Schiff.\"",
      "Over the last two months, prosecutors have sought to corroborate Bish's allegations by reviewing public records, issuing dozens of subpoenas, and scheduling interviews with key witnesses, including Bish herself.",
      "Pulte first contacted her with a direct message on X in July to request the complaint she had previously filed, sources said.",
      "On the same day that Pulte allegedly reached out to Bish, President Trump took to his social media platform to say that Schiff \"needs to be brought to justice\" based on the allegations first made in Bish's complaint.",
      "Just days after Pulte allegedly obtained the supporting documentation from Bish, Trump posted to social media a screenshot of the same materials -- including Bish's own highlighting.",
      "Nearly two months after Pulte's alleged outreach, Bowes -- a former banker who now works for the Office of Personnel Management -- contacted her over social media\u00a0to request an interview. Bish spoke to Bowes on multiple occasions about the Schiff investigation, sources said. Bish said that she believed Bowes worked for the Department of Justice as a lead investigator for Martin, according to sources.",
      "Bowes previously worked for the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the first Trump administration and was nominated to be the Commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A former banker with no legal or prosecutorial experience, Bowes faced criticism following a Wall Street Journal article that reported he disclosed trading stocks and options totaling $671,000 and $3.2 million during his time in government service, and his nomination never came up for a vote in the Senate. Bowes told the Wall Street Journal that he made a mistake and that one year's filing was too low to require disclosure.",
      "Strauss is a former federal prosecutor who Martin, earlier this year, unsuccessfully attempted to hire to work at the Department of Justice. He spent two years working for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida before being reassigned out of the office for attempting to pursue allegations of a voting fraud conspiracy related to the 2020 election. As of November, Strauss was not employed by the federal government.",
      "The FBI has attempted to contact both Bowes and Strauss\u00a0to understand the scope of their conduct, and prosecutors sent Bish a grand jury subpoena earlier this month to request all her communications with Bowes, Strauss, Pulte, and anyone who represented they were acting at the direction of Pulte or Martin, according to sources.",
      "'Fighters for justice and goodness'",
      "Since he failed to secure enough support to be confirmed as the chief federal prosecutor in D.C., sources say that Martin has sought a foothold within the Department of Justice to lead the cases against adversaries of the president, including James, Schiff and Cook.",
      "But the investigations of James and Schiff have been one step removed from Martin, who has virtually no experience as a prosecutor, and are instead led by federal prosecutors in Virginia and Maryland.",
      "Earlier this summer, Martin sought to expand his role by recruiting experienced prosecutors from Virginia and New York to join his \"Special Attorney Fraud Unit.\" Martin sent DOJ officials an email titled \"Help Wanted\" to encourage prosecutors to join him to be \"fighters for justice and goodness and the American way,\" according to materials reviewed by ABC News.",
      "\"In a special way, the SAFU is called to hold bad actors accountable,\" Martin said in his email. \"After all, as New York, Attorney General Leticia [sic] James said, 'Because no matter how big, rich, or powerful you think you are, no one is above the law.'\"",
      "But Strauss has not worked for the federal government since 2020 and lacks DOJ authorization to investigate a private individual, according to sources.",
      "And Bowes -- although he works for the Trump administration -- lacks the authority to conduct the investigations or review sensitive investigative materials. Bowes is believed to have accessed and reviewed grand jury information related to the James case, sources told ABC News.",
      "Bowes has frequently taken to social media to comment on ongoing matters, including the Schiff case, writing in social media posts this summer that Schiff \"violated\" Fannie Mae guidelines and sharing a news report that Trump blasted \"'Scam Artist' Adam Schiff over Possible Mortgage Fraud.\" In 2023, Bowes also alleged that Schiff was a \"proven liar\" and suggested that Schiff engaged in witness tampering. DOJ guidelines prohibit officials from posting about ongoing investigations on social media.",
      "After James pleaded not guilty to the indictment in her case last month, Bowes spoke with Lindell TV to opine on the case against James -- in direct violation of DOJ guidelines -- while representing himself as an OPM official assigned to the DOJ who worked directly on the James case.",
      "During the interview, Bowes commented about the evidence gathered in the James case and appeared to reference grand jury material.",
      "\"She felt very confident [that] she could bend the rules, break the rules, and now it appears that she's committed some felonies,\" Bowes said.",
      "Bowes also commented about what he believes would be an\u00a0appropriate sentence and how James would fare in prison.",
      "\"The bigger they are, the harder they fall,\" Bowes said. \"No one is above the law.\"",

      "The Trump administration is proposing new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, as President Donald Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production that is already leading the world",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced on Thursday new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems, as President Donald Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production.",
      "The oil industry has been seeking access to new offshore areas, including Southern California and off the coast of Florida, as a way to boost U.S. energy security and jobs. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.",
      "Since taking office for a second time in January, Trump has systematically reversed former President Joe Biden\u2019s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market. Trump, who recently called climate change \u201cthe greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,\" created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.",
      "Even before it was released, the offshore drilling plan has been met with strong opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is eyeing a 2028 presidential run and has emerged as a leading Trump critic. Newsom pronounced the idea \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in a social media post. The proposal also is likely to draw bipartisan opposition in Florida. Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.",
      "The administration\u2019s plan proposes six offshore lease sales off the coast of California.",
      "It also calls for new drilling off the coast of Florida in areas at least 100 miles from that state's shore. The area targeted for leasing is adjacent to an area in the Central Gulf of Mexico that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.",
      "The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 200 miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean.",
      "All offshore areas \u201cwith the potential to generate jobs, new revenue and additional production to advance America\u2019s energy dominance should be considered for inclusion,\u201d the American Petroleum Institute and other groups said in a joint letter to the Trump administration in June.",
      "The groups cited California\u2019s history as an oil-producing state. \u201cUndiscovered resources could be readily produced given the array of existing infrastructure in the area, particularly in southern California,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican and Trump ally, helped persuade Trump officials to drop a similar offshore plan in 2018 when he was governor. Last week, Scott and fellow Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody\u2019 co-sponsored a bill to maintain a moratorium on offshore drilling in the state that Trump signed in his first term.",

      "A Newsom spokesman said Trump officials had not formally shared the plan, but said \u201cexpensive and riskier offshore drilling would put our communities at risk and undermine the economic stability of our coastal economies.\"",
      "California has been a leader in restricting offshore oil drilling since the infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill that helped spark the modern environmental movement. While there have been no new federal leases offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.",
      "Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.",
      "A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. as the kind of project Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term reversing former President Joe Biden\u2019s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden\u2019s order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.",
      "Democratic lawmakers, including California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff and Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, warned that opening vast coastlines to new offshore drilling \"would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans\u2019 health and safety at risk.''",
      "Oil spills \u201cnot only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies and weaken coastal infrastructure,'' the lawmakers said in a letter signed by dozens of Democrats. One disastrous oil spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs and ecosystem restoration, they said.",
      "Joseph Gordon, campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, called the Trump administration's latest plan \u201can oil spill nightmare.\u201d",
      "Coastal communities \u201cdepend on healthy oceans for economic security and their cherished way of life,'' he said. \u201cWe need to protect our coasts from more offshore drilling, not put them up for sale to the oil and gas industry. There\u2019s too much at stake to risk more horrific oil spills that will haunt our coastlines for generations to come.\u201d",

      "\"Just the feelings of that and the intensity of the feeling will never leave me,\" Kitching told the AP in an interview. \"It is so deep in my heart, and the joy and the relief that we had our dad back again. It was just truly a very moving reunion for our family, and that feeling has never left me. It's the same feeling every time I see that picture.",

      "The family of enslaved potter David Drake \u2014 known as \u201cDave the Potter\u201d \u2014 has reclaimed two rare stoneware jars he created in South Carolina before the Civil War in what experts call the first major U.S. art restitution case involving works made by an e...",
      "BOSTON -- Inside the wide mouth of a stoneware jar, Daisy Whitner\u2019s fingertips found a slight rise in the clay \u2014 a mark she hoped was a trace left behind by her ancestor, an enslaved potter who shaped the vessel nearly 175 years ago in South Carolina.",
      "Standing in the gallery of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston last week, Whitner said she felt a quiet connection to her ancestor, David Drake, in that moment.",
      "\u201cI was telling the kids, \u2019Inside this jar, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m feeling his tears, sweat drops off his face, his arms,'\u201d said 86-year-old Whitner, a Washington, D.C., resident and a retired account manager for The Washington Post.",
      "The jar is one of two returned to Drake's family as part of a historic agreement this month between Drake's descendants and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, one of the institutions that holds pieces of his work.",
      "The vessels are among hundreds of surviving works by \u201cDave the Potter,\u201d an enslaved man who labored in the alkaline-glazed stoneware potteries of Edgefield, South Carolina, in the decades before and during the Civil War. Dave signed many of his jars \u2014 and inscribed some with rhyming couplets \u2014 an extraordinary and unparalleled assertion of identity and authorship during a time when literacy for enslaved people was criminalized.",
      "The agreement represents what experts say is the first major case of art restitution involving works created by an enslaved person in the U.S. \u2014 a process traditionally associated with families seeking the return of art looted by the Nazis in World War II.",
      "It\u2019s also rare: as enslaved people were denied legal personhood and documentation, tracing the ownership or lineage of their works is often impossible.",
      "Children\u2019s book author Yaba Baker, Dave's 54-year-old fourth-generation grandson, called the return \u201ca spiritual restoration.\u201d Baker, whose first two children\u2019s books explore Black history, said the family felt a dual sense of pride and grief. Many Black families, he noted, struggle to trace their ancestry past a few generations; recovering Dave\u2019s work gave them back a piece of themselves.",
      "After the museum returned the pots to the family, they sold one back so people can continue to learn from Dave's legacy. The other is on lease to the museum, at least temporarily. The MFA Boston said it wouldn't disclose how much it paid.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hide them away in our house. We want other people to be inspired by it,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe want people to know that this person, Dave the Potter, who was told he was nothing but a tool to be used, realized he had humanity. He deserved his own name on his pots. He deserved to write poetry. He deserved to know who he was.\u201d",
      "Laboring in the pottery yards in the South Carolina heat, Dave etched his name next to the date \u2014 July 12, 1834 \u2014 on a clay jar that would be sold by his owner and used to store pork and beef rations for enslaved people like him across the region.",
      "He also inscribed the jar, which would likely end up on a cotton plantation in South Carolina, with the couplet:",
      "\u201cPut every bit all between / Surely this jar will hold 14\u201d to mark the jar's 14-gallon capacity.",
      "The vessel was the first of hundreds, if not thousands, of stoneware jugs and jars made by Dave alongside other enslaved potters over 50 years before and during the Civil War.",
      "Much of Dave's poetry followed Christian themes. As he aged, he wrote more and explored themes related to his enslavement. One of his most resonant poems was etched into a jar he produced in 1857, around the time scholars believe Dave and his family were separated after being sold to different slave owners.",
      "\u201cI wonder where is all my relation / friendship to all \u2013 and every nation\"",
      "Multiple Drake descendants said they felt especially moved by Dave's question about his relations \u2014 and that their restitution felt like Dave's question was finally answered.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what became of the jars after Dave died. The MFA purchased them in 1997 from an art dealer. MFA Boston\u2019s Art of the Americas Chair Ethan Lasser said he thinks they survived mostly from pure \u201cbenign neglect\" in South Carolina because they were large and difficult to transport or break.",

      "A new Texas law says every public school classroom must display a poster listing the Ten Commandments",
      "DALLAS -- When it became clear to high school theater teacher Gigi Cervantes that she couldn't ignore a new state law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in her Texas classroom, she felt she had no choice. She resigned from the job she loved.",
      "\u201cI just was not going to be a part of forcing or imposing religious doctrine onto my students,\" she said.",
      "Texas is undertaking the nation\u2019s largest attempt to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools, and in the rush to navigate the Republican-led mandate that took effect in September, the rollout has forced some districts to confront hard choices.",
      "Federal courts have ordered more than two dozen of the state's nearly 1,200 school districts to not hang the posters, including on Tuesday when a judge ruled that the mandate violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion. Courts have also ruled against similar laws in Arkansas and Louisiana, and the issue is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "But many Texas classrooms are far along in implementing a law that has animated school board meetings, spun up guidance about what to say when students ask questions, and led to boxes of donated posters being dropped on the doorsteps of campuses statewide. Some districts didn't wait: In suburban Dallas, school officials in Frisco spent about $1,800 to print nearly 5,000 posters, even though the law only requires schools to hang the Ten Commandments if the displays are donated. Some schools have no posters to hang.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not evangelizing,\u201d said eighth grade U.S. history teacher Dustin Parsons, who has a Ten Commandments poster hanging in his classroom in the small city of Whitesboro. He said the display helps him to demonstrate the influence of Christianity on the country\u2019s founding principles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing it more from a history source perspective in how they were building the Constitution,\u201d he said.",
      "The law says schools must put donated posters \u201cin a conspicuous place\u201d and requires the writing to be a size and typeface that is visible from anywhere in a classroom to a person with \u201caverage vision.\u201d The displays must also be 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall (40 centimeters wide and 50 centimeters tall).",
      "South of Austin, the Hays Consolidated Independent School District posted copies of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights \u2014 which includes the First Amendment \u2014 alongside the state-required Ten Commandments.",
      "\u201cDistricts are in between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Elizabeth Beeton, a member of the Galveston Independent School District\u2019s school board.",
      "The Galveston school board voted not to post the commandments until the law\u2019s constitutionality is decided in the courts, but then found themselves the target of a state lawsuit. This week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced lawsuits against two more districts he said were violating the law, though one, the Leander Independent School District said they are displaying donated posters.",
      "Texas' law easily passed the GOP-controlled Legislature and Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have backed posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms.",
      "In suburban Dallas, Lorne Liechty rallied his family to raise money for Ten Commandments posters to donate to the Rockwall Independent School District.",
      "Liechty, an attorney and Rockwall County commissioner, sees the commandments as fundamental to his Christian faith, the country's legal system and the functioning of society.",
      "\u201cThese are just really good guides for human behavior,\u201d Liechty said. \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t know why people would object to any of these principles.\u201d",

      "Julie Leahy, director of legal services for the nonprofit Texas Classroom Teachers Association, says teachers have been asking about the consequences of refusing to display the commandments and whether they can also display posters with tenets of other religions.",
      "She said teachers also ask for guidance on how to handle students' questions.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, the answer is going to be that the teacher should send them back to their family,\u201d Leahy said.",
      "While the Austin high school where Rachel Preston teaches has been barred by a court order from displaying the Ten Commandments, she said she and her colleagues are anxious all the same.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re worried specifically about students who don\u2019t identify as Christian feeling unease at the very least at the presence of this in our classrooms, and struggling as well with how do we contextualize this?\u201d Preston said.",
      "When the Ten Commandments were posted last month throughout 16-year-old Madison Creed\u2019s high school in the small East Texas city of Carthage, she said it briefly became the \u201cbuzz of the school\u201d as students debated whether the religious doctrine belonged there.",
      "\u201cEverybody had their opinion about it,\u201d Creed said. \u201cI know talking to a lot of my peers and my classmates that a lot of us don\u2019t agree with it but there is the other portion of the school that does.\u201d",
      "Word also came that the high school band director had resigned over the law. Johnnie Cotton wrote on Facebook that he believed \u201cvery strongly that politics and religion have no place in the public schools.\u201d",
      "Creed, who plays in the band, said she understood and agreed with Cotton's stance, and admired that he stood up for his beliefs, even though his resignation two weeks before a big competition was badly timed.",
      "Creed\u2019s mother, Tiffany Meadows, said the posting of the commandments didn\u2019t bother her because she and her children are Christians, but that she was worried about students of other religions.",
      "\u201cThese are public schools, these aren\u2019t Christian schools,\u201d Meadows said.",
      "Cervantes, who said she believed complying with the law breached her students' First Amendment rights, ended her career at the Fort Worth Academy of Fine Arts this fall by leading her students through a production of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s comedy \u201cThe Imaginary Invalid.\u201d Her students presented her with a signed cast photograph and many said they respected her point of view.",
      "\u201cI kind of feel like we are living through a time where people who are in positions to be standing up for things are not standing up, not speaking out and there\u2019s a climate of fear,\" Cervantes said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be any part of that.\u201d",

      "Construction on the Protestant Episcopalian church began in 1907, with President Theodore Roosevelt present to help lay the foundation, but wasn\u2019t totally completed until 1990. Today, the cathedral stands as the sixth largest in the world and is the second largest in the country, following the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York.",
      "For Eisenhower\u2019s 1969 funeral, the World War II general was dressed in his wartime military uniform and at his request placed in a simple, government-issued casket that was meant for regular U.S. soldiers, according to the White House Historical Association.",

      "The Council of Nicaea is important both for what was done and how it was done.",
      "It involved an unprecedented gathering of at least 250 bishops from around the Roman Empire. Emperor Constantine had consolidated control over the empire after years of civil war and political intrigues.",
      "Constantine wouldn\u2019t formally convert to Christianity until the end of his life. But by 325, he had already been showing tolerance and favor toward a Christian sect that had emerged from the last great spasm of Roman persecution.",

      "It\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cTrinitarian Controversy,\u201d though the debate wasn\u2019t so much about whether there was a Trinity \u2014 God as Father, Son (Jesus) and Holy Spirit \u2014 but about how the Son was related to the Father.",

      "The bishops nearly unanimously supported a creed endorsed by the emperor. It\u2019s a shorter version of the Nicene Creed recited in church today. It declared Jesus to be \u201ctrue God\u201d and condemned those who proclaimed Arian ideas.",

Pope Leo, while in Turkey, also plans to meet with representatives of two Oriental Orthodox groups, the Armenian Apostolic and Syriac Orthodox churches.",
      "The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches had their own schism in the 11th century. They\u2019d already been growing apart over such things as papal authority, but a big controversy was that the Western churches had added a clause in the Nicene Creed that the Eastern ones hadn\u2019t agreed to. Specifically, the original creed said the Holy Spirit \u201cproceeds from the Father,\u201d but Catholics added, \u201cand the Son.\u201d",
      "Protestant churches later split over other issues, though most held to the Nicene Creed. Historic churches such as Lutherans, Anglicans and Presbyterians explicitly affirm the creed. Many modern evangelical churches that don\u2019t officially affirm the creed, such as many Baptists, have their own statements of faith that largely agree with it.",
      "A few notable exceptions, such as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, don\u2019t accept the Nicene formula.",
      "The Catholic and Protestant churches also began observing Easter differently than the Orthodox a few centuries ago, using an updated solar calendar \u2014 and opening yet another breach in Nicene unity.",

      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans, the laid-back city known as the Big Easy and the birthplace of jazz, where lavish parades, bead-throwing debauchery and Creole cuisine attract tourists from around the globe, is about to become the next staging ground for the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda.",
      "Operation \u201cSwamp Sweep,\u201d an expansive, monthslong immigration crackdown, is expected to launch in southeast Louisiana Dec. 1, but Democrat-run New Orleans is anticipating the arrival of as many as 250 federal troops as soon as Friday, all with the backing of the state\u2019s Republican governor.",
      "Governor Jeff Landry has sought to align New Orleans with federal immigration enforcement efforts through legislation and legal challenges, and the Border Patrol deployment is just the latest drive to ramp up that pressure. And with the New Orleans Police Department being released from a federal reform pact Wednesday, its officers have lost a legal mechanism that has long-shielded them from having to participate in immigration enforcement.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security operation will be led by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has already overseen aggressive campaigns in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Landry, who has close ties to the nation\u2019s top immigration officials, has made immigration enforcement a priority.",
      "Louisiana does not share a border with another country, yet it has become one of the nation\u2019s largest detention hubs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with a capacity upward of 6,000 detainees. In September, the Bayou State opened the \u201cLouisiana Lockup\" inside a notorious state prison to hold immigrants whom federal officials consider dangerous.",
      "The governor has also highlighted crimes in which the suspect\u2019s immigration status is in question, such as the killing of a French Quarter tour guide by a group that included a Honduran man who entered the country illegally.",
      "New Orleans\u2019 Democratic leaders frequently butt heads with Landry and other state officials who accuse the city of lax law enforcement and have pushed for collaboration with the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping immigration crackdown.",
      "Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, a Mexican-American immigrant, told The Associated Press there is \u201ca lot of fear\u201d in her city and that she is working to ensure those who could be targeted by federal agents know their rights.",
      "\"I\u2019m very concerned about due process being violated, I\u2019m very concerned about racial profiling,\u201d Moreno said.",

A city monument recognizes the thousands of Latino workers who helped rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. South Louisiana\u2019s distinctive Cajun heritage emerged from French-speaking colonists exiled there in the 18th century.",
      "In September, Landry requested a National Guard deployment to New Orleans, citing rising violent crime, even though city police say crime is down and its elected leaders say federal troops are unnecessary. Landry told Newsmax on Wednesday that the \u201cSwamp Sweep\u201d operation is focused on \u201ctaking dangerous criminals off the street.\u201d",

Cantrell did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under Landry, the GOP-dominated Louisiana Legislature has targeted New Orleans' immigration policies, including by passing a law threatening jail time for law enforcement officials who delay or ignore federal enforcement efforts. Another measure directs state agencies to verify, track and report anyone illegally in the U.S. who is receiving state services, and one more bans city policies that prohibit cooperation with federal immigration agencies.",
      "\u201cTheir enforcement of laws is indiscriminate at best, corrupt at worst,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Jay Morris, who was behind the law punishing obstruction of immigration enforcement. \u201cApparently we have to have a law to tell people not to break the law.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "This time, though AI toys are mostly sold online and more popular in Asia than elsewhere, Franz said some have started to appear on store shelves in the U.S. and more could be on the way.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said. One of the toys, a teddy bear made by Singapore-based FoloToy, was later withdrawn, its CEO told CNN this week.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",

We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agen \u2014 but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",
      "Beijing-based Keyi, maker of an AI \u201cpetbot\u201d called Loona, didn\u2019t return requests for comment this week, but other AI toymakers sought to highlight their child safety protections.",
      "California-based Curio Interactive makes stuffed toys, like Gabbo and rocket-shaped Grok, that have been promoted by the pop singer Grimes. The company said it has \u201cmeticulously designed\u201d guardrails to protect children and the company encourages parents to \u201cmonitor conversations, track insights, and choose the controls that work best for their family.\u201d",
      "In response to the earlier PIRG findings, Curio said it is \"actively working with our team to address any concerns, while continuously overseeing content and interactions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for children.\u201d",
      "Another company, Miko, based in Mumbai, India, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make its product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",
      "\u201cWe are always expanding our internal testing, strengthening our filters, and introducing new capabilities that detect and block sensitive or unexpected topics,\" said CEO Sneh Vaswani. \u201cThese new features complement our existing controls that allow parents and caregivers to identify specific topics they\u2019d like to restrict from conversation. We will continue to invest in setting the highest standards for safe, secure and responsible AI integration for Miko products.\u201d",
      "Miko\u2019s products are sold by major retailers such as Walmart and Costco and have been promoted by the families of social media \u201ckidfluencers\u201d whose YouTube videos have millions of views. On its website, it markets its robots as \u201cArtificial Intelligence. Genuine friendship.\u201d",
      "Ritvik Sharma, the company's senior vice president of growth, said Miko actually \u201cencourages kids to interact more with their friends, to interact more with the peers, with the family members etc. It\u2019s not made for them to feel attached to the device only.\u201d",
      "Still, Suskind and children's advocates say analog toys are a better bet for the holidays.",
      "\"Kids need lots of real human interaction. Play should support that, not take its place. The biggest thing to consider isn\u2019t only what the toy does; it\u2019s what it replaces. A simple block set or a teddy bear that doesn\u2019t talk back forces a child to invent stories, experiment, and work through problems. AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

      "The House Ethics Committee has announced that a panel will conduct a wide-ranging investigation into Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla",
      "WASHINGTON -- The House Ethics Committee announced Wednesday that it will conduct a wide-ranging investigation into Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., including whether he violated campaign finance laws, misused congressional resources and engaged in sexual misconduct or dating violence.",
      "Mills, now serving his second term, was ordered last month by a Florida judge to have no contact with his ex-girlfriend and to not go within 500 feet of her residence or where she works. Mills also is prohibited from referring to her on social media. The order is in effect through the end of the year, and any violation can result in a fine or imprisonment. The judge in the case said he had concluded that the woman was either a victim of dating violence or in danger of becoming one.",
      "The Ethics Committee made clear that it would be looking at numerous allegations involving Mills. The panel will also examine whether he failed to properly disclose required information on statements required to be filed with the House, violated campaign finance laws regarding his two congressional campaigns, and whether he improperly solicited or received gifts in connection with privately sponsored official travel.",
      "The mere fact that an investigative subcommittee was formed does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, the Ethics Committee noted.",
      "Mills said he looked forward to working with the Ethics Committee.",
      "\u201cI believe that all the accusations and false things that are being said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways,\u201d Mills said from the House floor. \u201cI have the evidence and receipts and look forward to working with them.\u201d",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced a censure resolution against Mills that would remove him from the House Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.",

      "Late Wednesday, the House voted 310-103 on Mills' request to refer Mace's resolution to the Ethics Committee, with most Republicans and Democrats in favor.",

      "Archaeologists have identified more than a dozen ancient canoes that Indigenous people apparently left behind in a prehistoric parking lot along a Wisconsin lakeshore",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Archaeologists have identified more than a dozen ancient canoes that Indigenous people apparently left behind in a sort of prehistoric parking lot along a Wisconsin lakeshore.",
      "The Wisconsin Historical Society announced Wednesday that archaeologists have mapped the location of 16 canoes submerged in the lake bed of Lake Mendota in Madison. Tamara Thomsen, the state's maritime archaeologist, said that the site lies near a network of what were once indigenous trails, suggesting ancient people left the canoes there for anyone to use as they traveled, much like a modern-day e-bike rack.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a parking spot that\u2019s been used for millennia, over and over,\u201d Thomsen said.",
      "Lake Mendota is a sprawling, 15-square-mile (38.8-square-kilometer) body of water on Madison's west side. The state Capitol building and the University of Wisconsin-Madison are located on an isthmus that runs between it and Lake Monona, a 5-square-mile (13-square-kilometer) lake to the east.",
      "The discoveries began in 2021 when archaeologists uncovered the remains of a 1,200-year-old canoe submerged in 24 feet of water in Lake Mendota. The following year they found the remains of a 3,000-year-old canoe, a 4,500-year-old canoe under it and a 2,000-year-old canoe next to it, alerting researchers that there was probably more to the site than they expected.",
      "Working with Sissel Schroeder, a UW-Madison professor who specializes in Native American cultures, and preservation officers with the Ho-Chunk Nation and the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Thomsen has now located the remains of 12 additional canoes, Thomsen said.",
      "Radiocarbon dating shows the oldest of the 16 canoes dates back to 5,200 years ago, making it the third oldest canoe discovered in eastern North America, she said. The two oldest were found in Florida, with the oldest of them dating back 7,000 years, Thomsen said.",

      "Wisconsin experienced a drought beginning about 7,500 years ago and lasting to around 1000 B.C., Thomsen said. The lake in the area where the canoes were found was probably only 4 feet (1.2 meters) deep over that period, she said, making it a good place to disembark for foot travel. The canoes likely were shared among community members and stored at designated points like the Lake Mendota site. Users would typically bury the canoes in sediment in waist- to chest-deep water so they wouldn't dry out or prevent them from freezing, Thomsen said.",
      "Travelers may have been headed to Lake Wingra, a 321-acre (130-hectare) lake on Madison's south side, Dr. Amy Rosebrough, the state archaeologist, said. The Madison area is part of the ancestral homeland of the Ho-Chunk Nation, which views one of the springs that feeds Lake Wingra as a portal to the spirit world, she said.",
      "\u201cThe canoes remind us how long our people have lived in this region and how deeply connected we remain to these waters and lands,\u201d Bill Quackenbush, the Ho-Chunk's tribal preservation officer, said in a news release.",
      "Thomsen speculated that if the drought did begin 7,500 years and archaeologists are finding canoes beneath other canoes, they may eventually find a 7,000-year-old canoe in the lake. That could mean Indigenous people that predated many of Wisconsin's tribes may have used the lake, she said.",
      "Thomsen spends most of her days uncovering Great Lakes shipwrecks and works on the canoe project only one day per week. But she called that work the most impactful she has ever done as an archaeologist because she engages with Wisconsin tribes, learns their history and tells their stories.",
      "\u201cI think I've shed more tears over this,\u201d she said. \u201cTalking with the Indigenous people, sometimes I sit here and just get goose bumps. It just feels like (the work is) making a difference. Each one of these canoes gives us another clue to the story.\u201d",

      "The 68-year-old's tremendous wealth immediately makes him a notable contender in a free-for-all that includes more than a half-dozen Democrats and two Republicans competing in an all-party June primary, with the top two vote-getters advancing to a November general election to succeed term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Steyer announced his candidacy with a pledge to improve economic conditions and by framing his political record as friendly to consumers, working-class voters and the environment.",
      "\u201cCalifornians deserve a life they can afford,\u201d he said in a video released Wednesday morning. \u201cBut the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living.\u201d",
      "The approach puts Steyer on a collision course with other candidates like progressive Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.",
      "At one time, Porter was viewed as a top contender but the contest is now seen as wide open. Steyer's personal fortune could give him an advantage in reaching voters through television and digital advertising in an expansive state with nearly 40 million people and multiple media markets. Still, tremendous wealth has not necessarily translated to statewide electoral success in California: Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, could not unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in their 2010 matchup. Meg Whitman, a onetime CEO of eBay, spent more than $100 million of her own money in a losing governor's campaign that same year.",
      "Steyer nodded to his wealth Wednesday, noting his business enterprises made \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d But he also sounded populist tones.",
      "\u201cThe richest people in America think that they earned everything themselves,\" he said, before dismissing that notion with an expletive for bovine excrement. \u201cThat's so ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Steyer said he would \u201cmake corporations pay their fair share again,\u201d and his campaign cited his previous work on ballot initiatives with similar aims. Steyer was a leading advocate for a 2012 ballot initiative that made it harder for corporations to avoid certain taxes. The new revenue was steered to energy improvements in the state's public schools.",

      "In other referendum work, Steyer helped lead the 2016 campaign that yielded a $2 per-pack tax hike on tobacco products. The money was steered to state health care programs, including tobacco-prevention efforts. And Steyer was a top opponent of a 2010 ballot initiative that would have rolled back California's clean air and climate law, which has been viewed as a national standard on climate policy.",
      "Steyer spent millions of his own money touring the country and pushing for Trump's impeachment during the Republican president's first term. He then ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, spending more than $200 million of his fortune and receiving no pledged delegates. After distant finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Steyer doubled-down with an expensive push in South Carolina, only to finish a distant third behind eventual nominee and President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Steyer then ended his presidential bid, and he financially supported Biden's reelection in 2024 before the Democrat bowed out in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, another Californian.",
      "Steyer's latest campaign comes amid some Democrats questioning Porter\u2019s candidacy after her combative exchanges with a TV journalist spread online in October. He has long been mentioned, along with Harris and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, as a potential heavyweight candidate who could join the field.",
      "Harris, who is on a national tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir, has said consistently that she has no plans to run \u2014 suggesting instead that any future campaign would be for the presidency.",
      "\u201cI will be voting,\u201d she told The Associated Press on Oct. 17 when asked about entering the governor's race. Asked whether she was satisfied with the field as Porter faced her most intense criticism, Harris said only that she wanted Democrats to have \u201cthe best and the brightest running and winning\u201d and that she was \u201cnot actively involved.\"",

    "story": [
      "As an artist, Lily Allen stands firm by her belief that heartbreak can be a gift. After all, it helped lead to her latest album, \"West End Girl.\"",
      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

    "story": [
      "If you felt a personal connection with a celebrity this year, you likely weren't alone.",
      "That feeling led Cambridge Dictionary to select \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year. Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "It's an academic term that has only been around for about 70 years, but it has now become mainstream, said Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager for Cambridge Dictionary.",
      "\"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,\" McIntosh said in a statement. \"The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial.'\"",
      "A recent example of this happened when pop star Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce announced their engagement. Many fans who have been captivated by Swift's lyrics for years celebrated the moment despite not actually knowing her or Kelce.",
      "But parasocial relationships can become problematic, Simone Schnall, a professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said.",
      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Parasocial trends take on a new dimension as many people treat AI tools like ChatGPT as 'friends,' offering positive affirmations, or as a proxy for therapy. This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this,\" Schnall said.",

      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",

      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L.

      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts.

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:15:24 -0500",
    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:42:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The composer and lyricist behind such hits as \"Godspell,\" \"Pippin\" and \"Wicked\" talks about the price of his early success, and why he almost left composing Broadway musicals for good.",
    "story": [
      "When songwriter Stephen Schwartz sits at the piano, he feels the music. \"When I was a kid and playing my Beethoven \u2026 I would play that bar over and over again, and cry. It's very embarrassing! Beethoven, living in a world that has nothing to do with ours, but he writes, and it speaks to us across the centuries.\"",
      "Schwartz knows a little something about speaking to audiences. He's the composer and lyricist of \"Wicked,\" the blockbuster stage musical-turned-two-part movie musical. Part two, \"Wicked: For Good,\" opens Nov. 21.",
      "The prequel to the classic \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" tells the story of Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo), who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West. The bubbly Glinda (played by Ariana Grande) becomes the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo perform \"Popular,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",
      "\"Totally, yeah. And in the '90s, I actually went back to school. I was pursuing a degree in psychology. I was gonna become a therapist.\"",
      "Studying to become a therapist turned out to be quite therapeutic. \"I think that time away reminded me of how to behave myself and how to collaborate and how to deal with other people, and not just come in like a bull in a china shop,\" he said.",
      "When he returned to songwriting, it was not for Broadway, though, but for Hollywood, writing songs for \"Pocahontas,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Enchanted,\" and music and lyrics for \"The Prince of Egypt.\" He picked up three Academy Awards along the way.",
      "\"The Colors of the Wind,\" from \"Pocahontas\":",
      "But Stephen Schwartz's home will always be the stage. \"I feel so blessed and so fortunate that work I've done has this ongoing life that I know is gonna keep going when I'm not here on this planet anymore,\" he said. \"Listen, I'm 77 years old, and they still let me do this!\"",

      "The Vatican shared the spotlight with Hollywood on Saturday as Pope Leo XIV hosted dozens of stars, including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee and Monica Bellucci for a special audience celebrating the power of cinema.",
      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",

      "A pope who \"grew up with cinema\"",
      "Leo is the first American-born Pope and grew up during Hollywood's heyday. Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:38:26 -0500",
    "summary": "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene an\u00a0ally during the shutdown for joining Democrats in demanding that Congress address high health care costs.",
    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-december-2025-rate-cut-probability-fomc-meeting-economy/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The government's latest jobs data could affect whether Federal Reserve officials continue their push to ease borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "Just a few weeks ago, a December interest rate cut was viewed as practically a done deal by many economists. Now, with fresh government data showing solid U.S.\u00a0job growth in September, many forecasters think the Federal Reserve is likely to hold off lowering borrowing costs when policy makers meet next month.",
      "The probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut now stands at 22%, down from a likelihood of 97% as of mid-October, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. CME Fedwatch, a tool that forecasts rate cuts based on changes in the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, gives slightly better odds of a reduction, at about 41%.",
      "Translation: Wall Street economists and traders alike expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged at its next two-day meeting on Dec. 9-10. That would amount to a pause in the central bank's recent move to lower lending rates, coming after two consecutive cuts in September and October.",
      "The shift in expectations for future Fed rate cuts follows a six-week blackout in federal economic data because of the\u00a0government shutdown, a hiatus that hindered the central bank's ability to assess key economic trends. Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark federal funds rate \u2014 or what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 if officials conclude that the job market and broader economic growth are in danger of stalling. But Thursday's jobs data showed that employers continued to hire at a healthy clip in September.",
      "\"Given that today's numbers were not a bad as feared, in conjunction with hawkish statements from the Fed recently, it does appear that the Fed will skip a cut in December,\" Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar, said in an email.",
      "He added, \"But with the negative trend in labor markets remaining in place, we'd expect the Fed to resume cutting in their next meeting in January 2026, if they don't cut this December.\"",
      "The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 3.75% to 4%.",
      "A move by the Fed to dial back rate cuts in 2026 could keep borrowing costs for homes and cars elevated. Pricier mortgages and auto loans are also reinforcing the feeling among many Americans, reflected in sentiment polls, that the cost of living remains too high.",
      "Mixed economic picture",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment in check. The central bank cited the slowing labor market when it twice trimmed borrowing costs this fall.",
      "But the latest payroll gains released Thursday showed that employers hired 119,000 people in September \u2014 more than double what most economists had forecast. The nation's unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%, the highest level since October of 2021. The increase in the jobless rate suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "At the same time, inflation has edged up, climbing at an annual rate of 3% in September. That puts pressure on the Fed to keep price increases from spiraling higher, with some policymakers expressing concern over persistent inflation.",
      "The mixed economic picture is complicated by the absence of more recent official data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said\u00a0this week that it will fold some October jobs data into its November report, which is set for release after the Fed's next meeting, on Dec. 16.",
      "\"September's payroll numbers may have surprised to the upside, but in terms of the Fed's December interest rate decision, October is what mattered,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in an email. \"With that data now delayed until after the FOMC meeting, the Fed's rate-cut path has more question marks.\"",
      "She added, \"Overall, the available economic data has supported a December cut, but given the Fed's cautious bent, it may choose to wait until it has more numbers in hand.\"",

      "Verizon said it would lay off 13,000 employees on Thursday. That follows major recent job cuts by\u00a0Target, Amazon, UPS\u00a0and other major companies.",
      "What it means",
      "The September employment figures suggest job growth remains firm amid concerns that the labor market was at risk of stalling.",
      "\"The September jobs report may be backward-looking, but offers reassurance that the labor market wasn't crumbling before the government shutdown,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Although job growth has weakened, \"it is not collapsing,\" added Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, thinks the odds of a rate cut have \"diminished significantly\" given there will not be a full October employment report and the November report won't be issued until after the Fed meets in December.",
      "Ashworth expects the Fed to delay its next rate cut until January. The probability of a rate cut now stands at 22%, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Delayed employment reports",
      "The September jobs report, originally slated for Oct. 3, was pushed back by the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. The delay means it offers a belated snapshot of the labor market just before federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it won't publish the full October employment report, which was originally slated for release on Nov. 7. Instead, the agency will fold select October data into the November report, which is set for release on Dec. 16.",

    "title": "Despite complaints of gaps in Medicare Advantage networks, enforcement is rare",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicare-advantage-networks-complaints-federal-enforcement/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 10:22:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Government documents show that federal regulators rarely warn plans that their networks of health providers are so skimpy they violate legal requirements.",
    "story": [
      "Along with the occasional aches and pains, growing older can bring surprise setbacks and serious diseases. Longtime relationships with doctors people trust often make even bad news more tolerable. Losing that support \u2014 especially during a health crisis \u2014 can be terrifying. That's why little-known federal requirements are supposed to protect people with privately run Medicare Advantage coverage when contract disputes lead their health care providers and insurers to part ways.",
      "But government documents obtained by KFF Health News show the agency overseeing Medicare Advantage does little to enforce long-standing rules intended to ensure about 35 million plan members can see doctors in the first place.",
      "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request covering the past decade, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services produced letters it sent to only five insurers from 2016 to 2022 after seven of their plans failed to meet provider network adequacy requirements \u2014 lapses that could, in some cases, harm patient care.",
      "Agency officials said some plans lacked enough primary care clinicians, specialists, or hospitals, according to the letters. And they warned that failure to meet the requirements could result in a freeze on marketing and enrollment, fines, or closure of the plan.",
      "CMS declined to detail why it found so few plans with network violations over the 10 years. \"The number of identified violations reflects the outcomes of targeted reviews, not a comprehensive audit of all plans in all years,\" said Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson.",
      "Officials in states with Advantage network violations say CMS didn't notify them, including directors of the government-funded State Health Insurance Assistance Program, which helps people navigate Medicare.",
      "\"It's hard for me to believe that only seven Medicare Advantage plans violated network rules,\" said David Lipschutz, a co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group. \"We often hear from folks \u2014 particularly in more rural areas \u2014 who have to travel significant distances in order to find contracted providers.\"",
      "Medicare Advantage is an increasingly popular alternative to the government-run Medicare program, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities. Of the 63 million Americans who were eligible to join Advantage plans instead of traditional Medicare, 54% did so for this year. The plans usually offer lower out-of-pocket costs and extra benefits, like coverage for vision, dental, and hearing care, but typically require their members to stick to select networks of doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Last year, the federal government paid Advantage plans an estimated $494 billion to care for patients.",
      "Traditional Medicare, by comparison, has no network and is accepted by nearly all doctors and hospitals in the nation.",
      "Conflicts between Medicare Advantage plans and the doctors, hospitals, and other providers that serve their members are common. Just this year, at least 38 hospital systems serving all or parts of 23 states have cut ties with at least 11 Advantage plans after failing to agree on payment and other issues, according to a review of news releases and press reports. Over the past three years, separations between Advantage plans and health systems have increased 66%, said FTI Consulting, which tracks reports of the disputes.",
      "After March, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are generally locked into their plans for the year until the annual open enrollment period happening now through Dec. 7, for coverage beginning Jan. 1. But hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, and other health providers can leave plans anytime.",
      "When providers and insurers separate, Advantage members can lose access to longtime doctors or preferred hospitals in the middle of the year. In response, CMS sometimes gives Advantage customers a little-known escape hatch called a \"special enrollment period\" to change plans or enroll in traditional Medicare midyear.",
      "How CMS decides who gets an SEP is a mystery even to well-versed state insurance regulators and U.S. senators who oversee federal health programs. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) cited previous KFF Health News reporting on Medicare Advantage in an Oct. 30 letter asking CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz for an explanation.",
      "\"Despite the serious impacts of SEPs on enrollees and the market, the process of SEP determinations is opaque, leaving enrollees and state regulators in the dark,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Seniors deserve to know their Medicare plan isn't going to pull the rug out from under them halfway through the year,\" Wyden told KFF Health News.",
      "\"Help us\"",
      "Oz spoke to Medicare Advantage insurers Oct. 15 at a conference organized by the Better Medicare Alliance, a trade group, and encouraged them to help CMS police fraud in the program.",
      "\"Be our early-warning system,\" he told them. \"Tell us about problems you're witnessing. Help us figure out better ways of addressing it.\"",
      "When he finished speaking, he took a seat in the audience next to the president and chief executive of the group, Mary Beth Donahue, and smiled for photos.",
      "In six letters KFF Health News obtained, CMS officials told five insurers that their network adequacy violations could affect Advantage members' access to care. Five letters listed the number or types of medical specialists or facilities missing from the networks. In three cases, CMS noted that plans could request exceptions to the rules but didn't. In one letter, CMS requested the plan allow members to receive out-of-network care at no additional cost. Four letters required specific steps to address deficiencies, including submitting evidence that more clinicians were added to networks.",
      "Three letters required a \"corrective action plan,\" set deadlines for fixing problems, and warned that failure to comply with the rules could result in enrollment and marketing suspensions, fines, or forced plan closure. The other three letters were a \"notice of non-compliance,\" which urged insurers to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Although CMS regards the letters as the first step in its enforcement process, the agency did not provide information about whether these violations were resolved or if they resulted in penalties.",
      "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a group created by Congress to monitor the program, said in a June 2024 report that \"CMS has the authority to impose intermediate sanctions or civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with network adequacy standards, but it has never done so.\"",
      "One of the network adequacy violation letters went to Vitality Health Plan of California in November 2020. That came after five hospitals and 13 nursing homes in one county and four hospitals in another all left the insurer's network, according to the letter from Timothy Roe, then-director of CMS' Division of Compliance, Surveillance, and Marketing. Two months before sending its letter, CMS granted Vitality plan members a special enrollment period.",
      "Beneficiaries welcomed the opportunity, said Marcelo Espiritu, program manager of the Santa Clara County office of California's Health Insurance Counseling & Advocacy Program. But Espiritu didn't know at the time that Vitality's depleted network violated CMS requirements, which Roe said put \"the health of Vitality's beneficiaries at risk.\"",
      "\"By not having enough network providers, beneficiaries may not be able to receive necessary services timely, or at all,\" Roe wrote.",
      "That's information patients need to know, Espiritu said.",
      "\"People would not be able to receive promised benefits and there would be delays in care and a lot of frustration in trying to find a new plan,\" he said. \"We would certainly warn people about the plan and remove it from our materials.\"",
      "Representatives from Commonwealth Care Alliance, which acquired Vitality in 2022, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Network minimums",
      "Federal law requires Medicare Advantage plans to include in their networks a minimum of 29 types of health care providers and 14 kinds of facilities that members can access within certain distances and travel times. The rules, which vary depending on a county's population and density, also limit how long patients should wait for appointments. The agency checks compliance every three years, or more often if it receives complaints.",
      "Networks can vary widely even within a county because the provider minimums apply to the insurer, not each plan it sells, according to a report from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. The company can offer the same network to members of multiple plans in one or more counties or create a separate network for each plan.",
      "In Arizona's Maricopa County, KFF researchers found, UnitedHealthcare offered 12 plans with 12 different networks in 2022. Depending on the plan, the company's customers had access to 37% to 61% of the physicians in the area available to traditional Medicare enrollees.",
      "In early 2016, CMS allowed 900 people in an Advantage plan in Illinois run by Harmony, then a WellCare subsidiary, to leave after the Christie Clinic, a large medical practice, left its provider network. The WellCare plan continued to operate without the clinic. But in June 2016, CMS told the plan in one of the letters KFF Health News obtained that losing the Christie Clinic meant the remaining provider network violated federal requirements.",
      "It was \"a significant network change with substantial enrollee impact,\" the letter said.",
      "Claudia Lennhoff, executive director at Champaign County Health Care Consumers, a government-funded Medicare counseling service that helped the WellCare members, said her group didn't know about the letter at the time.",
      "\"Not disclosing such information is a violation of trust,\" Lennhoff said. \"It could lead someone to make a decision that will be harmful to them, or that they will deeply regret.\"",
      "Centene Corp. bought WellCare in 2020, and representatives for the St. Louis-based company declined to comment on events that occurred before the acquisition.",
      "Two violation letters KFF Health News obtained from CMS went to Provider Partners Health Plan of Ohio in 2019 and 2022. The Ohio Department of Insurance was unaware of the violations, spokesperson Todd Walker said. He said CMS also did not notify the Ohio Senior Health Insurance Information Program, the state's free counseling service.",
      "Rick Grindrod, CEO and president of Provider Partners Health Plans, which is based in Maryland, said that after CMS reviewed its 2019 network, \"we proactively reduced our service area and deferred enrollment in the plan until 2021.\"",
      "But Grindrod said the plan enrolled only a small number of members in one county in 2021 and decided to withdraw from the Ohio market entirely at the end of that year.",
      "After Provider Partners withdrew from Ohio, CMS sent it another letter in March 2022 saying its network in 2021 had gaps in four counties for four types of providers and facilities. CMS asked the plan to comply with network rules by adding more providers.",
      "\"We believe CMS' network adequacy standards are generally clear and appropriate for ensuring beneficiary access,\" Grindrod said. \"While the standards are not difficult to understand, as a provider-sponsored plan with a small footprint, we sometimes face challenges securing contracts with large systems that prioritize larger Medicare Advantage plans.\"",
      "In 2021, CMS also sent a violation letter to North Carolina's Liberty Advantage. CMS didn't tell the state's free counseling service, the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program, about the letter, said its director, Melinda Munden.",
      "Liberty representatives did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "CMS sent a letter in 2016 to CareSource about network deficiencies in some of its Medicare Advantage plans sold in Kentucky and Indiana. The agency asked the company to fix the problems, including by reimbursing any members billed for services from doctors who were not in the plans' networks.",
      "\"In response to the 2016 violations, we promptly implemented a Corrective Action Plan, which included a thorough review of our provider network to ensure adequacy standards were met,\" said Vicki McDonald, a CareSource spokesperson. \"CMS approved our plan, and no further action was required.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "summary": "The former Treasury secretary said he's resigning from the board of OpenAI after last week's release of emails\u200b between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles after last week's release of emails between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,\" Summers said in a statement.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress,\" he said.",
      "On Wednesday night, Summers went on leave from teaching at Harvard University, with his spokesperson, Steven Goldberg, saying in a statement: \"Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review. His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.\" A Harvard spokesperson said Summers \"communicated his decision\" to the university.",
      "Summers said earlier this week that he will be stepping back from \"public commitments\" after dozens of messages between him and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",

      "Summers joined the OpenAI board in 2023.",
      "The emails showed Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "The exchanges between Summers and Epstein include one in which they appeared to banter about a woman Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer him advice.",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, was a key economic adviser in the Obama administration. The former president of Harvard University, Summers was teaching two classes at the school.",

    "summary": "The chipmaker's record growth will allay investor concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday, referring to the company's proprietary superchips that power large language models.",
      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",
      "China hurdle",
      "Nvidia reported robust demand for its chips despite being blocked from the vital Chinese market because of U.S. export restrictions as the two nations compete on AI.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Collete Kress on Wednesday said the company is \"disappointed\" it can't ship products to China.",
      "\"To establish a sustainable leadership and position in AI computing, America must win the support of every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China,\" she said, adding that Nvidia will continue to push for access to the Chinese market.",
      "Wedbush's Ives said he expects the export controls to be removed in 2026 as the U.S. and China continue trade negotiations.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:27:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Although inflation has eased, many Americans say they still feel squeezed financially. Here are five areas where households are feeling the pinch.",
    "story": [
      "Although inflation across the U.S. is far cooler than in the post-pandemic years, millions of Americans say they still feel the pinch of rising prices, struggle to pay the bills and express concern about their financial prospects.",
      "Price increases are nowhere near the level reached in June of 2022, when the Consumer Price Index hit a 40-year high of 9.1%. Yet many people feel squeezed by the cost of simple daily necessities, including the ability to afford healthy food, and by long-term increases in the cost of essentials such as housing and health care.",
      "This affordability crisis is rooted in a combination of both longstanding economic issues dating back decades and more recent developments. For instance, housing costs have surged partly due to a lack of available homes, a result of cutbacks in construction following the Great Recession, while more recently steep new U.S. tariffs have fueled inflation.",
      "Inflation and the economy now rank as Americans' top national concerns, according to an October CBS News poll.",
      "\"Everything is going up in price very quickly,\" said Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas.",
      "With his family's monthly health care premiums set to rise 18% to $2,600 next year, he's planning to cut back in other areas. \"Our food budget is going to go down \u2014 we're not talking about eating beans and rice, but going from a comfortable middle-class lifestyle to eating how we did when we first got out of college,\" Tolbert said.",
      "Here are five key categories of spending that many Americans are struggling to afford.",
      "Food",
      "Almost half of Americans say it's harder to afford groceries today than it was a year ago, according to a September survey\u00a0by Axios and the Harris Poll. Only 19% said food prices are cheaper than a year earlier, with roughly a third seeing no change.",
      "Growth in food prices has eased considerably, although it is still rising, with the latest CPI report showing grocery prices rose 2.7% in September on an annual basis, a sharp contrast to the\u00a011.4% increase in 2022. Overall, however, food prices as of September were more than 18% higher than in January of 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "Shoppers don't assess food costs the same way economists do. They focus on their day-to-day spending \u2014 which keeps climbing \u2014 and compare their out-of-pocket spending today with what they paid several years ago,\u00a0according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "In other words, people's experience of inflation and how they measure it in their daily lives may not mesh with official economic measures that paint a more optimistic picture.",
      "Meanwhile, other recent signals underscore the difficulty many Americans have simply putting food on the table. Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to data from Purdue University's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "In New York City, for example, 40% of local families can't afford their weekly food costs, according to new data from charitable organization Robin Hood and Columbia University.",
      "Housing",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "The data backs that up, with a homebuyer today needing to earn $121,400 a year to afford a typical home, meaning that their monthly costs would remain below 30% of their annual income, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The average American earns about $84,000 a year, highlighting the considerable gap between incomes and home prices.",
      "Several forces have pushed housing costs higher. The rate of home construction plunged after the 2008-09 financial crisis, leading to a shortfall in housing inventory. Meeting today's demand for housing would require building as many as 4 million additional homes beyond current construction levels, Goldman Sachs estimates.",
      "The low interest rates that prevailed during the pandemic, when homebuyers could secure mortgages below 3%, sparked a buying rush that sent prices soaring. Even with a slight cooling this year, homes are selling for about 25% above their 2019 levels, while mortgage rates have more than doubled since their pandemic lows.",
      "Child care",
      "The challenge of affording child care is another pain point for many families. In 2024, the average annual cost of care for one child around the U.S. topped $13,000, up 30% from 2020, according to Child Care Aware America, a nonprofit group.",
      "Families with a single child can end up paying between roughly 9% and 16% of their median income on full-time day care,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Labor. That means parents are often spending more on child care than they do on other expenses, such as groceries or even rent, data shows.",
      "Gina Monroe, a 42-year-old mom based in Massapequa, New York, said the financial strain of child care has made her and her husband think twice about having another child. She started sending her 2-year-old son to day care in September and pays around $450 a week.",
      "\"Nothing's getting any cheaper,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Child care costs have surged partly because there aren't enough early education workers to support the number of children who need care, according to experts. The industry also pays meager wages, adding to the challenges of recruiting new workers, said Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families.",
      "Health care",
      "Americans are also getting socked by rising health care costs, ranging from higher insurance premiums to out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays. The increase in medical costs stems largely from the emergence of more expensive treatments, such as the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs, as well as an aging population that requires more care, according to consulting firm Mercer.",
      "The cost of health care was at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with Democratic lawmakers pushing to extend a tax credit to defray the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The shutdown ended without an agreement to extend the subsidies, which means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums rise from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "Employees who get their insurance through employer-based plans are likely to see their health care costs rise as much as 7% for their 2026 plans, according to Mercer.",
      "Electricity and utility costs",
      "Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utility costs, up 12% since last year, according to a new\u00a0report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.",
      "The surge stems from a succession of rate hikes across the U.S, as electricity demand outstrips supply. In 2025 alone, more than 124 million Americans are expected to see some sort of rate increase in their energy bill, a recent PowerLines\u00a0report\u00a0found.",
      "Even if you do your best to shut off every light, some fixed costs are unavoidable, such as the so-called \"delivery charge,\" or what a utility charges to send electricity from a power plant to a home, said Rodrigues of the National Parents Union.",
      "The energy burden falls most acutely on low- and middle-income families, who spend between 6% and 10% of their income on energy, or three to five times that of higher-income households, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.",

      "Customers will be able to browse Target's selection and make purchases within the ChatGPT app, according to the retailer. The tool will debut next week, providing access to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users in time for the holiday shopping season.",
      "Target is leaning on price cuts and a $1 billion investment plan to revive its brand, the retailer said separately Wednesday, as same-store sales fell 2.7% in the latest quarter and profit tumbled 19%. With shoppers increasingly relying on AI to find products online, other big retailers \u2014 including Walmart, which struck a similar partnership with OpenAI last month \u2014 are turning to the technology to boost sales.",
      "Here's how the ChatGPT-powered Target tool will work: Inside the ChatGPT app, consumers can tag Target and ask for ideas, such as if they're planning something like a holiday family movie night. The Target app will then suggest specific products, such as blankets or snacks, and allow users to buy them directly without leaving the ChatGPT interface.",
      "Target said that AI will eventually start to understand and predict what customers want to buy.",
      "A recent Harris Poll\u00a0shows that nearly half of Gen Z consumers would trust AI as a personal shopper that helps them pick out what they buy and find deals. Streamlining the purchasing process could help retailers boost sales, according to retail experts.",

      "Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site\u00a0LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent.",
      "Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care.",
      "LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing,\u00a0energy and\u00a0health care costs. A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",
      "One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September.",
      "\"Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,\" she told CBS News.",

      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",
      "For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a\u00a0$2,000 tariff rebate check\u00a0and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week\u00a0announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs.",
      "Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.",
      "Why are child care costs soaring?",
      "Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows.",
      "The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S.",
      "To that end, Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, pointed to what he described as \"child care deserts\" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found.",
      "Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted.",

    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",

      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

      "Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs.",

      "Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month\u00a0soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while\u00a0ADP data\u00a0released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1.",

      "\"Stocks are extending their losses so far on [Tuesday] as sentiment stays downbeat and investors continue to dial back on tech exposure,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a research note.",
      "What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to investors because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street. It can almost single-handedly steer the direction of the S&P 500 on some days because of its immense size, after fervent demand for its AI chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. The S&P 500 sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts.",
      "\"The boost AI has given to the U.S. stock market since the launch of ChatGPT has been so strong that the S&P 500 would currently be closer to 5,000 without it,\" John Higgins, chief markets economist with Capital Economics, said in a note to investors. \"It's therefore hardly surprising that investors are preoccupied with whether the gains racked up by titans in the sectors at the heart of this transformative technology can be sustained.\"",
      "Nvidia's and the U.S. stock market's struggles are a sharp turnaround from months of relentless rallying since April, when Wall Street sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs.",

But when asked what the No. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a high chance of damage, 45% pointed to an AI bubble. That beat out trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars.",
      "The highest net percentage of investors in 20 years is also saying companies are \"overinvesting,\" according to the survey. The worry is that all the investment pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one.",

      "Before taking power last month, Prime Minister Senae Takaichi, 64, was a vocal critic of China and its military build-up in the Asia-Pacific.",
      "If a Taiwan emergency entails \"battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival (of Japan),\" she told parliament on Nov. 7. Under Japan's self-imposed domestic rules, an existential threat is one of the few cases where it can act militarily. Taiwan sits around 60 miles from the nearest Japanese island.",
      "In response to Takaichi's remarks, a Chinese diplomat stationed in Japan threatened to \"cut off that dirty neck,\" apparently referring to Takaichi, as China and Japan summoned each other's ambassadors.",

      "The tit-for-tat warnings from both capitals have fueled concern about nationalism being whipped up, and Coren said there was no apparent off-ramp available to ease tension. Japan sent a senior diplomat to Beijing for talks on Tuesday, but there was no announcement of any significant progress to ease the bilateral standoff.",
      "During the daily briefing on Tuesday at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman demanded that Japan \"immediately retract its erroneous remarks, engage in profound self-reflection, change course, and provide the Chinese people with a clear explanation\" of Takaichi's comments.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:18:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Nov. 9 said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a\u00a0Truth Social post last week. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later\u00a0told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"\u00a0 That threshold is still in discussion, he added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "Speaking from the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said his administration plans on issuing dividends from tariffs \"probably in the middle of next year.\"\u00a0He said \"thousands of dollars\" would go to \"moderate income, middle income\" Americans, adding that his administration has taken in \"tremendous amounts of money\" from tariffs.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Nov. 9 told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending new tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-retirement-age-2026-change-66-67-increase/",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:27:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age is changing next year, affecting when the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers can collect 100% of their benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security's so-called \"full retirement age\" \u2014 the age when people can start collecting all of their earned benefits \u2014 is about to hit a new threshold, a change that will affect Americans born in 1960 or later.",
      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",
      "In the meantime, younger boomers and Gen Xers will have to hold off a little longer to claim their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"These younger cohorts will have to try their best to plan for retirement, knowing that they cannot collect full benefits until 67,\" Richtman added.",

      "Artificial intelligence can save you money preparing that Thanksgiving Day feast.",
      "Just tell an AI chatbot such as ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft Co-Pilot how many guests you're expecting, provide information on any dietary restrictions and outline your budget. The tools will help compare prices at different stores, and can even offer step-by-step instructions on how to prepare a Thanksgiving meal, as well as outline different recipes for various dishes.",
      "For example, Microsoft Co-Pilot lets users take photos of specific products and then ask questions about the product, like \"where can I find the best deal on this boxed stuffing?\" or \"how many boxes of this stuffing will I need to feed 10 people?\" The chatbot will offer suggestions based on those prompts, help shoppers buy the appropriate amount of ingredients and stay on budget by pointing to any cheaper options at local stores.",
      "Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst who goes by \"The SupermarketGuru,\" said smart shoppers can feed guests this holiday season for under $6 a person.",
      "AI is one tool consumers can use to ensure they're getting the best deals and to keep their holiday budgets under control. This year, shoppers can expect to spend roughly $80 to $95 \u2014 or $8 to $9.50 per person \u2014 preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to a recent Wells Fargo analysis.",
      "That's about 2% to 3% less this year compared with Turkey Day costs in 2024, the bank found. Consumers are catching a break on foods such as bread, butter, eggs and wine, while the cost of staples such as potatoes, milk and some vegetables has remained flat or risen only modestly, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "As for the star ingredient, turkey, wholesale prices have jumped about 40% since last year, from 94 cents a pound to $1.32, according to the Department of Agriculture. However, wholesale costs don't always mean higher store prices. Wells Fargo found that retail prices for turkey are down 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Retailers are also making it easier for shoppers to save money and time by offering budget-friendly Thanksgiving dinner packages. Target offers a dinner option that serves four people for $20, while Amazon provides a similar package that feeds five for $25. Each bundle includes a turkey, along with ingredients for classic sides such as stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy and bread.",
      "For larger gatherings, Walmart and ALDI also have $40 meal baskets designed to serve up to 10 people.",

    "story": [
      "A growing share of lower-income Americans are struggling to get by financially as their wages fail to keep up with inflation, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Roughly 29% of lower-income households are living paycheck to paycheck, up slightly from 2024 and from 27.1% in 2023, data from the Bank of America Institute shows. The financial firm defines that as spending more than 95% of household income on necessities such as housing, gasoline, groceries, utility bills and internet service.",
      "In 2025, nearly a quarter of all U.S. households lived paycheck to paycheck, Bank of America estimates. Several factors explain why many people are falling behind.",
      "First, the nation's inflation rate this year has edged up to an annual rate of 3%\u00a0after dipping to 2.3% in April. The rise in consumer prices this year is well below their pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022, but remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.",
      "\"Inflation is picking back up again, and cost increases are picking back up again,\" said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute, which recently\u00a0examined\u00a0the financial pressures facing Americans by income. \"That's definitely going to put some renewed pressure on those households.\"",
      "Second, the cost of groceries and other essentials is continuing to rise as lower-wage workers see their paychecks and purchasing power stagnate. In October, wages for lower-income households were up only 1% from a year ago, according to Bank of America deposit data.",
      "\"The gap between their wages and expenses has just continued to widen since the beginning of the year,\" Wadford said. \"When the cost of living is increasing 3% but your wages are only increasing 1%, you're just going to really struggle to keep up.\"",
      "Lower-wage workers experienced strong wage growth during the pandemic and subsequent economic recovery, but that rise has slowed sharply since late 2022, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. One factor weighing on wage growth \u2014 a decline in job openings and the rate at which workers are leaving their jobs.",
      "\"When people aren't looking for other offers or quitting, that is going to cause wage growth to slow,\" she said.",
      "In the trailing 12 months through October, higher-income millennial households have seen their average wages grow five percentage points faster than those of lower-income millennials, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "While lower-income households are struggling to scrape by, middle- and higher-income households are on firmer financial footing, buoyed by stronger wage growth. This group has seen little to no increase in the share of households living paycheck to paycheck, the Bank of America Institute found.",
      "\"These higher-income cohorts are more able to absorb the recent reacceleration in inflation due to their outsized wage growth,\" Wadford wrote in the report.",
      "That bifurcation is fueling what economists refer to as the \"K-shaped economy,\" a term experts use to describe the divergence in spending and financial health between wealthier Americans and people with more modest incomes.",
      "Gould also noted that many low-income Americans are unbanked and that Bank of America's findings, which are drawn from an analysis of its depositor data, may not fully capture the impact of slowing wage growth on poor households.",
      "\"You're missing some of the bottom end and how much pain [and] economic distress they may be feeling,\" she said.",

      "The president said in a later post, \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" He also reposted \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking from the Senate floor Thursday morning, said \"the president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials.\" Schumer called it an \"outright threat\" that is \"deadly serious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a draft plan aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, his office confirmed Thursday.",
      "It said in a statement that he had \"officially received a draft plan from the American side, which, according to the American side, could activate diplomacy.\" The statement went on to say \"it was agreed to work on the points of the plan in such a way as to bring the war to a dignified end.\"",
      "A senior White House official confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that President Trump was backing a 28-point plan drafted by envoy Steve Witkoff and an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war Russia started nearly four years ago with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it's not clear whether this plan is the one that Zelenskyy received.",
      "The plan, according to reports by Axios, the Financial Times and the New York Times, calls for Ukraine to abandon territory, give up some weapons and shrink its army, and while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the war must end, he reiterated that from Kyiv's perspective, \"there can be no reward for waging war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the plan was first reported by NBC.",
      "Previously, Ukraine has agreed with the U.S. to a freezing of the battle lines where they stand as a starting point for negotiations, while also making clear that it needs security guarantees from Washington and its Western partners.",
      "In an interview with Axios on Monday, Kirill Dmitriev, an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff had written a 28-point peace plan during a face-to-face visit last month in Miami.",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions, which had to be waived for him to travel to Florida to meet with Witkoff.",
      "The White House official who spoke with CBS News on Thursday said Witkoff had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and said that he consulted with both the Russians and Ukrainians to take their feedback into account. The extent of those consultations with Ukraine was not clear from Kyiv's statement Thursday, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the same day that Witkoff and Rubio \"met with some of the Ukrainians just in the past week to discuss this very plan.\"",
      "Senior Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov was verbally briefed in Miami this week by Witkoff, a source familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "Top European Union official Kaja Kallas, when asked Thursday if Europeans were involved in the process, responded, \"Not that I know of.\" She also reiterated a point that's consistently been made by Ukraine and its supporters that \"for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-website-change-vaccines-autism/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees without input from relevant agency staffers.",
    "story": [
      "A page of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was changed to include a false claim about autism and vaccines. Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees inside the Department of Health and Human Services without input from relevant agency staffers.",
      "The page about vaccines and autism formerly said that \"no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and Autism spectrum disorder.\" The website has now been changed to say, \"'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim\" \u2014 a statement the Autism Science Foundation calls \"misinformation\" that \"actually contradicts the best available science.\" The CDC page also falsely claims that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have \"been ignored by health authorities.\"",
      "Previously, changes have only occurred in consultation with subject matter experts at the agency's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC sources told CBS News political appointees at HHS devised the change and instructed an employee inside the office of acting CDC Director Jim O'Neil to make it.",
      "Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. The National Institutes of Health has committed hundreds of millions of dollars a year to studying the condition and trying to understand how and why it develops.",
      "The debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism has its roots in a 1998 study that was\u00a0found to be fraudulent\u00a0and has been retracted. Since then, \"independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people,\" said American Academy of Pediatrics president Susan Kressly in a statement decrying the website change.",
      "\"We are at a very dangerous moment for the health of America's children,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a news briefing on Thursday.",
      "Research has found no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not. Vaccines also undergo intensive safety testing. Research shows that genetics play a role in autism diagnoses. The NIH says some possible risk factors for autism include prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health conditions, or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "\"There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism,\" said Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director. \"This change to CDC language undermines the agency's scientific integrity, damaging its credibility on vaccines and other health recommendations. Most concerning, it risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, \"This is a common-sense update that brings CDC's website in line with our commitment to transparency and gold standard science.",
      "\"As the updated page explains, the claim that 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by comprehensive evidence, as studies to date have not definitively ruled out potential associations. Some research suggesting possible biologic mechanisms has been ignored or dismissed by public health agencies, and HHS is committed to finding a definitive answer.\"",
      "Leading autism advocacy groups dispute that. The Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0it was \"appalled\" by the change to the CDC's website, and highlighted the decades of research into the topic. Alison Singer, the co-founder and president of the ASF, said that while researchers \"can't do a scientific study to show that something does not cause something else,\" there are a \"mountain of studies that we have exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism.\"",
      "\"I think the question of whether vaccines causes autism is one that science can answer, and science has answered it,\" Singer said in Thursday's news briefing.",
      "A subhead saying that \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" remains on the CDC website with an asterisk next to it. The bottom of the page explains that the header remains in place because of an agreement with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and backed HHS\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0during his confirmation hearings.",
      "Cassidy said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he supported Kennedy in part because of \"serious commitments\" from the Trump administration, but did not specify what those were. Cassidy's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",
      "Other health agency pages with information about autism and vaccines had not been changed as of early Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed the\u00a0discredited claim\u00a0that routine\u00a0childhood shots\u00a0cause autism. President Trump has also falsely suggested vaccines could be to blame for autism rates. Both expressed concern about rising rates of\u00a0autism diagnoses, which appear to be driven by a variety of factors including\u00a0increased awareness\u00a0and changes in how the condition is diagnosed.",
      "O'Leary said he feared the website changes would \"scare parents and further stigmatize\" people with autism.",
      "\"We have been dealing with these falsehoods for many years. They are not new. We have been promoting the science, and we're going to continue to do that, as are the other professional societies,\" he said. \"The problem is now it's coming from, these falsehoods are coming for our federal government.\"",
      "Experts have previously raised concerns about Kennedy reviving debunked theories about the cause of autism. In April, Kennedy announced the CDC would conduct a \"massive testing and research effort\" to find out what causes the disorder, and hired David Geier, a man who repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the effort. Kennedy said the work would be completed by September, though other health officials later pushed the timeline.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious disease physician and former CDC official, said that the website change showed scientists \"who in the past carefully vetted scientific information have been pushed aside.\"",
      "The \"CDC should be a data driven agency based on science and not ideology, but when you take the scientists out of the process you get rhetoric that can harm families,\" said former CDC chief science and medical officer Dr. Debra Houry.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-official-testifying-abrego-garcia-liberia/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:51:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is pushing to remove Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.",
    "story": [
      "A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official testified Thursday about the steps the Trump administration has taken to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the West African country of Liberia, as the Trump administration continues its push to remove him from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over Abrego Garcia's challenge to the administration's efforts to deport him, had ordered the immigration official, John Cant\u00fa, to testify in-person. Cant\u00fa is a top official at Enforcement and Removal Operations at ICE and had submitted to the court a declaration about a discussion between the State Department and the Costa Rican government about possibly accepting Abrego Garcia, as well as his potential deportation to Liberia.",
      "Cant\u00fa said that if the Trump administration had the green-light to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S., the government would schedule a commercial flight or charter a plane bound for Liberia. He said that the Liberian government provided assurances to the State Department that Abrego Garcia would not be persecuted, tortured or sent back to El Salvador.",
      "Asked about the declaration filed with the court, Cant\u00fa said he included in it information that was provided to him by the State Department.",
      "Abrego Garcia has designated Costa Rica as a country he is willing to be deported to. An order from Xinis has been in place since August that prevents the Trump administration from deporting Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",
      "But earlier this month, the Trump administration urged\u00a0Xinis to lift that order\u00a0and allow the government to remove him to Liberia, arguing that the administration has gone through all the necessary steps to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has been a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown since the Salvadoran immigrant was removed from where he lived in Maryland to his native country in March. He was sent to El Salvador even though in 2019, an immigration judge granted him a legal status known as withholding of removal because of concerns Abrego Garcia could be persecuted by gangs there.",
      "He faces deportation proceedings because he entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011.",
      "In June, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after he was detained in El Salvador's notorious mega-prison to face two felony charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.",
      "Before Abrego Garcia's criminal trial is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to several African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.",
      "The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, was interviewed in October by a U.S. government asylum officer, and that officer determined that he failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia. The Justice Department said any additional due process would be unwarranted.",
      "Abrego Garcia's \"claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,\" the Justice Department said in its filing. \"This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.\"",
      "In addition, the Justice Department submitted declarations from U.S. officials stating that Liberia has made \"sufficient and credible\" assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be harmed there or removed from Liberia to another country where he potentially could be persecuted.",
      "In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on \"a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,\" following a U.S. request.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture.

      "A federal immigration crackdown based in Charlotte, North Carolina's largest city, is now over, a local law enforcement agency said Thursday.",
      "The sheriff's office in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, said federal officials have confirmed with Sheriff Garry McFadden that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection operation known as \"\u00a0Charlotte's Web,\" has officially concluded. No border agent operations will occur on Thursday, a news release from the sheriff's office said.",
      "\"It is important to clarify that while the 'Charlotte's Web' operation has ended, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will continue to operate in Mecklenburg County as they always have,\" the news release said. \"ICE maintains full authority to detain, apprehend, and take into custody any undocumented immigrant in accordance with federal law.\"",
      "A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately respond Thursday to an Associated Press email seeking a response about the sheriff's statement.",
      "The operation that began in Charlotte over the weekend led to hundreds of arrests, according to authorities. It was part of President Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts, which have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities, from Chicago to Los Angeles.",
      "The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday. Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said on X that \"border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended\" in the city.",
      "The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond was about double the total announced by Homeland Security officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies \"continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.\" Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.  Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge. The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.",
      "Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-redistricting-court-ruling-california-prop-50/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 09:09:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The court ruling came after California voters formally approved a ballot measure that was introduced to counteract Texas' redistricting.",
    "story": [
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom said California's redistricting would counter Texas' rare mid-decade redistricting push. That doesn't mean California is turning back after a federal court in Texas blocked the state's recently redrawn congressional map from going into effect for the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Tuesday's court ruling came weeks after California voters formally approved a ballot measure that was introduced to counteract Texas' redistricting. The California measure originally included trigger language that said the state would only redraw its congressional map in response to a similar move by a Republican-led state, but legislators removed the language before voters went to the polls.",
      "\"Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned and democracy won,\" Newsom wrote on X Tuesday following the court ruling. \"This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.\"",
      "Paul Mitchell, whose firm was hired to draw California's congressional districts, posted on social media that the maps will be staying in place.",
      "\"The trigger language was removed in the legislative process as it was clear that TX was redistricting. So, even if their map is invalidated/postponed, the Prop 50 maps stay in place,\" Mitchell wrote.",
      "Earlier this year, Texas lawmakers redrew their congressional maps in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort, which kicked off after President Trump pushed for new congressional district boundaries that could help secure five Republican-friendly seats.",
      "The move set off a redistricting battle across the U.S., with Newsom \u2014 a potential 2028 presidential candidate \u2014\u00a0 leading an effort to neutralize potential Republican gains in Texas by redrawing California's own congressional lines to net up to five seats for Democrats.",
      "In August, California lawmakers approved several bills to redraw the state's congressional map to potentially make five Republican-held congressional districts more favorable to Democrats. Because the measures required changes to the state's constitution, they had to be put before voters in a special election.",
      "Earlier this month, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, setting the stage for newly-drawn congressional maps for the 2026 midterms.",
      "California lawmakers removed trigger clause",
      "When California state lawmakers initially introduced their redistricting legislation, it included a trigger clause under which California would only redraw its congressional map in response to a similar move by a Republican state.",
      "Under that trigger language, California's redistricting map would \"become operative only if Texas, Florida, or another state adopts a new congressional district map that takes effect after Aug. 1, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2031, and such redistricting is not required by a federal court order.\"",
      "However, the trigger clause was removed just before California lawmakers voted on the redistricting bills. Without that trigger language, as it stands now, the Texas ruling does not impact California's redrawn map.",
      "During an August press conference, Newsom was asked if California would move forward with Proposition 50 even if a court were to strike down Texas' maps.",
      "\"We're moving forward,\" Newsom responded. \"Texas moved forward. Texas acted. Texas is moving forward. You're suggesting, people are suggesting. Texas is not going to move forward because of what we just did? Come on.\"",
      "The Trump administration has sued California over its new congressional lines. A hearing is scheduled for Dec 3.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration denounced the ruling striking down Texas' maps. Texas on Tuesday afternoon appealed the ruling striking down its maps to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"We strongly disagree with today's district court ruling on Texas's redistricting map - Texas's map was drawn the right way for the right reasons,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. \"We look forward to Texas's victory at the Supreme Court.\"",
      "According to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, the ruling invalidating Texas maps would not have an effect on California's redistricting efforts given the facts that were considered by the court.",
      "\"Texas maps were struck down by the court based on how Texas actually drew the lines, and that has very little to do with how California drew their lines,\" Levitt told CBS News.",
      "In the Texas ruling, in a 2-1 decision, federal judges found \"substantial evidence\" that \"Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.\" The court considered a letter that the Justice Department sent to Texas lawmakers in July stating the state's 2021 map was \"unconstitutional\" because it included four congressional districts where no ethnic group had an outright majority, concluding that the state must therefore dismantle and redraw its lines.",
      "The court found this to be a \"legally incoherent assertion.\"",
      "\"California didn't do anything like that,\" Levitt said. \"California drew districts overwhelmingly for partisan reasons and there's actually nothing that the litigants in California have pointed to that indicates that California focused predominantly or excessively based on race.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on a dispute over Louisiana's congressional map and whether race can be used as a factor when drawing districts. In October, justices appeared poised to weaken a key provision, Section 2, of the Voting Rights Act that has allowed the consideration of race when drawing districts, and has been used to ensure minority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.",
      "This could lead to more redistricting efforts as states eliminate race as a factor for their standing congressional voting lines.",
      "\"It is terribly disturbing that this is where we are at,\" Texas Democratic state Rep. Ramon Romero told CBS News. \"A point where communities that have been so grossly underrepresented for basically our entirety of the history of our country and now that there's growth in opportunity, there's growth in education, there's growth in representation, those wealthy billionaires that are manipulating our country for their benefit have won at the expense of so many families and people of color.\"",
      "Romero was among the Texas lawmakers who broke quorum in August by leaving the state in attempts to block the GOP-backed congressional maps. Though he says today's ruling was a victory for Democrats, much remains to be determined after the Supreme Court weighs in.",
      "The timing of a Supreme Court decision is unknown, but the clock is ticking for Texas. Congressional candidates have until Dec. 8 to file to run for next year's midterm election and appear on the primary ballot set for March.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:53:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed changes include the elimination of the \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's administration moved Wednesday to roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live, reviving a suite of changes to Endangered Species Act regulations from the Republican's first term that were blocked under former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "The proposed changes include the elimination of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process.",
      "The administration's announcement answers longstanding calls for revisions to the Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. The president has voiced frustration with the\u00a01973 law\u00a0and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Critics argue the landmark 1973 environmental law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth.",
      "But environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the\u00a0monarch butterfly, Florida\u00a0manatee, California spotted owl\u00a0and North American wolverine.",
      "Scientists and government agencies say extinctions are accelerating globally because of habitat loss and other pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump has made oil and gas production a centerpiece of his presidency and sought to strip away environmental regulations that impede development. Other pending proposals from the administration would revise the definition of \"harm\"\u00a0under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \"the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\"",
      "\"These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\" Burgum said in a statement.",
      "Another proposed change tasks officials with analyzing economic impacts when deciding whether habitat is critical to a species' survival.",
      "In April, a White House official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump planned to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live. The president\u00a0directed\u00a0agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "Case of lizard shows potential outcome of proposals",
      "The case of the Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Southwest exemplifies the potential consequences of the proposals. Rapidly warming temperatures have ravaged a population of the lizard in Arizona's Mule Mountains, pushing the reptiles further up the mountainsides toward the highest peaks and possibly toward extinction.",
      "A petition filed Wednesday seeks protections for the lizard and the designation of critical habitat. Advocates say analyzing the economic impacts could delay protections. Designating critical habitat could be another hurdle because the primary threat to this population of spiny lizard is climate change.",
      "\"We think that the species should be listed as endangered. In fact, we are somewhat shocked that it is not already extinct,\" said John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, who co-authored the petition.",
      "The move comes 18 months after\u00a0CBS News first reported\u00a0on the lizard's disappearance from much of its historic range. At that time, Wiens and our team hiked to the top of the Mule Mountains under ideal weather conditions for finding lizards but found none.",
      "But Wiens, whose scientific protocol requires multiple surveys, returned twice more and both times found about a half-dozen on a few scattered rock outcrops near the summit.",
      "\"You have to go back. You have to be rigorous,\" Wiens told CBS News.",
      "The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts.",
      "Species designated as \"threatened\" under the rule automatically qualify for the same protections as those with the more severe designation of \"endangered.\"",
      "PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \"necessary course correction.\"",
      "\"This reform acknowledges the blanket rule's unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\" Wood said.",
      "Proposals would undermine protections, critic says",
      "Kristen Boyles with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the changes undermine protections even more than in Mr. Trump's first term. That includes allowing the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to not count negative effects on species if those impacts are not regulated by the agencies themselves, Boyles said.",
      "\"The Services are required to prevent harmful consequences to species, not ignore them,\" she said.",
      "Trump officials during his first term also rolled back protections for individual species including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf.",
      "The spotted owl decision was reversed in 2021 after officials said Mr. Trump's political appointees used faulty science to justify opening millions of acres of West Coast forest to potential logging. Protections for wolves across most of the U.S. were restored by a federal court in 2022.",
      "The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. In the more than 50 years since the law was enacted, the\u00a0act has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish:\u00a0salmon\u00a0and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",
      "Last month, an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that arctic seals\u00a0are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of\u00a0bird species\u00a0around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion. One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said as it released its latest\u00a0Red List of Threatened Species.",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The Border Patrol's predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over - often for reasons cited such as speeding, no turn signals or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement's radar.",
      "The AP's investigation, the first to reveal details of the program on America's roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol's parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\"",
      "\"For national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\" the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \"to operate anywhere in the United States,\" the agency added.",
      "The program has been growing",
      "Once limited to policing the nation's boundaries, the Border Patrol's surveillance system stretches into the country's interior and monitors ordinary Americans' daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, according to two people familiar with the program. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers' behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency's network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked the Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration's heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "Concern about rights of monitored drivers",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as the Border Patrol's as raising constitutional questions.",
      "Courts have started to recognize that \"large-scale surveillance technology that's capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\" might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, expressed alarm when told of AP's findings.",
      "\"They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know,\" she said. \"These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\"",

      "The Justice Department alleged that in 2021, a year before Cherfilus-McCormick was elected to Congress, a health care company that she ran was overpaid $5 million on a Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded contract related to coronavirus vaccinations. The defendants in the case allegedly \"conspired to steal\" the money by sending it through multiple accounts.",
      "Some of that overpaid money was then used to help fund Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign to represent South Florida in the House, the Justice Department alleged. In particular, she was accused of funneling some of the money to friends and family members who donated it to her campaign, in what's known as a \"straw donor\" scheme.",
      "\"Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.\"",
      "The Justice Department's statement did not specify the charges against Cherfilus-McCormick or any other defendants. An indictment for Cherfilus-McCormick was not posted on the federal court database as of Wednesday evening.",
      "\"This is an unjust, baseless, sham indictment \u2014 and I am innocent,\" Cherfilus-McCormick said in a statement provided to CBS News early Thursday morning. \"The timing alone is curious and clearly meant to distract from far more pressing national issues. From day one, I have cooperated with every lawful request, and I will continue to do so until this matter is resolved. I am deeply grateful for the support of my district, and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I look forward to my day in court. Until then, I will continue fighting for my constituents.\"",

    "story": [
      "One day after a Trump-appointed federal judge helped toss out Texas' redistricting effort, a Reagan-appointed judge penned a heated and invective-filled dissent accusing his fellow jurist of \"cherry-picking of the highest order.\"",
      "A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 on Tuesday that Texas must set aside the new congressional maps that it drew earlier this year, with Judge Jeffrey Brown writing for the majority that the map \u2014 which would create five new GOP-friendly House seats \u2014 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling was issued by Brown and Judge David Guaderrama, nominated to the bench by President Trump and former President Barack Obama, respectively. The state of Texas quickly\u00a0appealed the ruling\u00a0to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The ruling could upend this year's nationwide redistricting gambit. Multiple states have followed Texas' lead and redrawn their maps, including California, which made five congressional districts more friendly to Democrats in response.",
      "The panel's third member, Judge Jerry Smith, filed his response on Wednesday, writing the phrase \"I dissent\" some 16 times over the course of his 104-page opinion.",
      "Smith, nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987, accused the two other judges of issuing the ruling without giving him enough time to respond, which he called an \"outrage.\" He wrote that in the days prior to the ruling, Brown sent him a pair of drafts that were more than 160 pages long, only offered a few days to react, and didn't wait for Smith to write his dissent.",
      "\"In my 37 years on the federal bench, this is the most outrageous conduct by a judge that I have ever encountered in a case in which I have been involved,\" Smith wrote.",
      "The dissent \u2014 which started by warning readers, \"Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night!\" \u2014 also attacked the opinion itself in often-harsh terms. He called Brown an \"unskilled magician,\" compared his reasoning to a \"bizarre multiple-choice question from hell,\" and called the ruling the \"most blatant exercise of judicial activism that I have ever witnessed.\"",
      "At one point, when discussing the court's decision to grant a preliminary injunction, Smith writes: \"If this were a law school exam, the opinion would deserve an 'F.'\"",
      "Race or politics?",
      "At the heart of Smith and Brown's disagreement is whether Texas lawmakers redrew the state's House districts for partisan reasons or racial reasons.",
      "The map-drawing effort began after Mr. Trump and his allies pushed Texas officials over the summer to create as many as five new GOP-leaning seats, as Republicans fight to hold onto a razor-thin House majority in next year's midterms.",
      "At one point during that gambit, Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, sent Texas Gov. Greg Abbott a letter alleging that a handful of the state's existing districts were illegal \"coalition\" districts where non-Hispanic White voters are in the minority but no single racial group has a majority.",
      "Tuesday's majority opinion, penned by Brown, said that Abbott \"explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race\" and \"repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts.\"",
      "The court concluded that the state's redistricting effort was unconstitutional because it was driven by racial considerations, not pure politics. It's legal for lawmakers to redraw maps for partisan reasons, Brown wrote, but racially gerrymandered maps can be challenged in court.",
      "Smith disagreed, pointing to evidence that he said shows the new Texas maps were actually driven mainly by partisan politics rather than race.",
      "The judge cited testimony from one of the mapmakers, Adam Kincaid, who explained at length why he made certain decisions to shift around the boundaries of congressional districts. Smith said Kincaid \"had a perfectly legitimate and candidly partisan explanation for his every decision.\"",
      "Smith also noted at one point that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who pushed to redraw his state's maps in response to Texas, \"took a victory lap\" after this week's ruling.",
      "\"That tells you all that you need to know\u2014this is about partisan politics, plain and simple,\" Smith said.",
      "In response Wednesday night, Newsom wrote on X: \"This judge says California's redistricting in response to Texas was overwhelmingly partisan. Yes, ours was. That was the ENTIRE POINT!\"",
      "Smith claimed the \"main winners from Judge Brown's opinion are George Soros and Gavin Newsom.\" He alleged Soros, the liberal megadonor, and his son, Alex Soros, \"have their hands all over this,\" claiming several lawyers and experts for the plaintiffs have links to groups that have received funding from the Soros family's Open Society Foundations.",
      "And Smith warned that, if the decision stands, it could disrupt next year's congressional races.",
      "\"As a legal and practical matter, Judge Brown's injunction turns the Texas electoral and political landscape upside down,\" he said. \"It creates mayhem, chaos, misinformation, and confusion.\"",
      "The League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the plaintiffs, said Smith's claim that the redistricting was purely political is \"flatly contradicted by the record.\" The group also rejected Smith's claim that the ruling would lead to \"chaos,\" saying the \"true risk would be allowing an unlawful, racially discriminatory map to stand.\"",
      "\"Protecting voters from racial discrimination is not activism; it is a constitutional obligation,\" LULAC CEO Juan Proa\u00f1o said. \"The majority acted responsibly to uphold the law and safeguard the rights of millions of Texans.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Wednesday he has signed a bill that requires the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days, after months of controversy that ended with the House and Senate passing the bill by nearly unanimous margins this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the bill-signing in a Truth Social post that lashed out at prominent Democrats with links to Epstein.",
      "\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump endorsed the legislation over the weekend, after a handful of House Republicans joined with Democratic lawmakers and forced the House to hold a vote. The legislation passed the House 427-1 on Tuesday and moved through the Senate unanimously.",
      "Mr. Trump's support for the bill marks an about-face after the president had urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue for months, calling the push for more federal records on Epstein to be released a distraction tactic.",
      "Maria Farmer, who accused Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, of sexual abuse in the 1990s, said the bill-signing was a \"long time coming.\"",
      "\"I have waited nearly three decades for answers about how my reports of abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were investigated by federal authorities,\" she said in a statement. \"After being left in the dark for decades, having my repeated calls for transparency and action ignored, and living through nearly five administrations that turned a blind eye to this enormous travesty of justice, Congress finally listened to survivors.\"",
      "Farmer is currently suing the FBI, which she alleges ignored her initial sexual assault accusation. She said Wednesday that the bill's passage \"doesn't absolve the government and law enforcement's enormous failure to do its job the past 30 years.\"",
      "\"I hope to see the government make good on its promise of transparency and release the entirety of the files \u2013 not bits and pieces, not mass redactions but the complete truth, removing only child sexual abuse material and victim names and identifying information,\" she said.",
      "What will the Epstein files bill do?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to make public all of the Justice Department and FBI's unclassified records, communications and investigative materials related to Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Maxwell.",
      "It's not clear what new documents will emerge, but Epstein and Maxwell were at the center of a series of federal investigations dating back nearly two decades. Tens of thousands of pages of records on their cases have been released by lawmakers in recent months, including files held by the government and Epstein's estate.",
      "Epstein was initially investigated by federal and local authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended with him controversially agreeing to plead guilty to state prostitution charges in exchange for avoiding a federal indictment. Then, in 2019, he was charged in New York federal court with sex trafficking of minors, but he died by suicide while in federal custody. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking a year later and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The case has drawn years of public fascination, including speculation and conspiracy theories spurred by Epstein's extensive ties to wealthy and powerful people. Democrats have criticized Mr. Trump for his yearslong friendship with Epstein, while Mr. Trump has scrutinized former President Bill Clinton for his relationship with the late financier. Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and representatives for Clinton say he was not aware of Epstein's crimes. Neither Mr. Trump nor Clinton has been accused of illegality or charged with a crime, and both have denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The Trump administration has faced calls from both sides to release more information on Epstein \u2014 and criticism from its own allies after some administration officials had promised further disclosures.",
      "In February, Bondi gave out binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" to a group of right-wing influencers, but she faced backlash after the influencers said much of the information was already public.",
      "Five months later, the Justice Department and FBI finished a review of the Epstein case and concluded that there was no incriminating \"client list,\" no evidence that he blackmailed prominent people and no evidence that would support an investigation into anybody else. The review also found that he died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019. Some Trump supporters were dissatisfied and unconvinced by the findings.",
      "The push to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act was led by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie. Seeking to navigate around GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson's skepticism of the bill, the pair circulated a \"discharge petition,\" a procedural move that requires the House to vote on a bill if a majority of its members sign on.",
      "The petition drew support from four Republicans, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a onetime Trump ally who has increasingly broken with her party in recent weeks. Mr. Trump announced last week he was withdrawing his endorsement of Greene, which the Georgia lawmaker speculated was driven by the Epstein issue.",
      "For weeks, the petition sat at 217 signatures \u2014 one short of the number needed to force a vote \u2014 as newly elected Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva awaited her swearing-in ceremony after winning her seat in a September special election. Democrats accused Johnson of slow-walking Grijalva's swearing-in due to the Epstein bill, but Johnson said the delay was because the House remained out of session during the government shutdown.",
      "Grijalva signed the petition last week, forcing the House to hold a vote. Within days, Mr. Trump encouraged House Republicans to vote for the bill, leading it to pass easily on Tuesday.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House blocked an effort to formally censure Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida and strip him of his committee assignments over allegations related to federal contracting violations, stolen valor and assault.",
      "GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced the censure resolution earlier Wednesday, citing troubling allegations against the congressman.",
      "She introduced the resolution as privileged, meaning GOP leadership had two legislative days to hold a floor vote on the measure. Mills successfully maneuvered to effectively kill the resolution by referring it to the House Ethics Committee.",
      "\"All the accusations and false things that are being said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways,\" Mills said ahead of the vote. \"And I have the evidence and receipts.\"",
      "The vote came hours after the Ethics Committee announced it is investigating Mills for alleged campaign finance violations, sexual misconduct and other potential wrongdoing. Mace called the investigation \"a naked attempt to kill my resolution.\"",
      "Mills has faced a number of controversies this year, including allegations that he threatened to release nude photos of a former girlfriend, which prompted a judge to grant a protective order in October. The censure resolution also cites reports that Mills was investigated for potential domestic violence in February. Mills has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.",
      "\"Cory Mills' alleged conduct makes him unfit to serve on any committee responsible for our national security,\" Mace said in a statement.",
      "\"I will not stand by while women risk everything to come forward with credible allegations of abuse and threats. I will not stay silent while a Member of Congress may be lining his pockets through federal contracts. And I will not look the other way while allegations of stolen valor, a slap in the face to every veteran who earned their service and sacrifice, goes unchecked,\" she said.",
      "The financial allegations revolve around a report by a congressional watchdog in August 2024 that found Mills may have misrepresented information on his campaign finance disclosure forms and may have \"entered into, held, or enjoyed contracts with federal agencies while he was a Member of Congress in violation of House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law.\"",
      "Mace's resolution also stated that \"individuals who served in the military with Representative Cory Mills have called into question the veracity of the account of events which formed the basis of a recommendation that ... Mills receive an award of a Bronze Star, bestowed in 2021, for his service under enemy fire in Iraq in 2003.\"",
      "In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson earlier Wednesday, Mace expressed \"grave concern regarding the fitness\" of Mills and urged the Louisiana Republican to take action to remove him from his committee assignments. Mills serves on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "Mace's effort followed attempts from Democrats to formally rebuke him in retaliation for censure measures that GOP members brought against Democrats for their conduct.",
      "Democrats threatened to force a vote on another censure measure against Mills on Tuesday if Republicans had succeeded in censuring Del. Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat from the Virgin Islands. The push to punish Plaskett came after revelations that she was texting convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a House Oversight Committee hearing in 2019.

    "summary": "A federal judge is continuing his investigation into whether the Trump administration defied court orders in a high-profile immigration case involving the Alien Enemies Act, he said Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge is continuing his investigation into whether the Trump administration defied court orders in a high-profile immigration case involving the Alien Enemies Act, he said Wednesday.",
      "In an 8-3 ruling last week, a federal appeals court left in place an earlier decision that blocked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's April order,\u00a0which said that probable cause exists to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over its \"willful disregard\" of his order in March to turn around two planes carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members bound for a prison in El Salvador.",
      "But the panel also found that even though his initial ruling had been struck down, Boasberg, who is the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., could continue his probe into whether the Trump administration had violated his court order.",
      "\"The district court's order here was a measured and essential response to what it reasonably perceived as shocking executive branch conduct,\" Judges Nina Pillard, Robert Wilkins and Bradley Garcia wrote in a joint opinion.",
      "\"I will be going forward with it,\" Boasberg said. \"I certainly intend to find out what happened that day.\"",
      "In April, Boasberg wrote that the Justice Department's actions were \"sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. The court does not reach such [a] conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.\"",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders \u2014 especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "Boasberg will also continue to hear arguments on the merits of the case, which arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-invoked law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans whom his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "After Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a group of Venezuelan migrants immediately sued to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. Boasberg swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, in an emergency hearing, ordered government lawyers to return to the U.S. people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed toward El Salvador.",
      "The judge then blocked the Trump administration from conducting deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities, however.",
      "But Boasberg said that after his orders, the government did not stop the removal process under the Alien Enemies Act, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the invocation of the act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.",
      "Remarks by Trump administration officials raised questions for Boasberg regarding whether it had violated his\u00a0 order. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that \"boasts\" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele \"intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.\"",
      "Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear.",
      "On Wednesday, Boasberg said that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and live witness testimony under oath, if needed.",
      "Potential witnesses, Boasberg said, include Erez Reuveni, who admitted in court that the Justice Department should not have deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia in March and was put on leave and then fired by the Justice Department.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\", Reuveni said he was called to a meeting with Emil Bove, who was then the No. 3 in charge at the Justice Department and is now a federal judge, and Bove told him to potentially ignore court orders if a judge tried to slow the Alien Enemies Act deportations that were underway.",
      "\"Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what,\" Reuveni said. \"Then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, 'f*** you.'\"",
      "Another likely witness, Boasberg said, is Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general who was the attorney of record in the first hearings in the case.",
      "In court, Boasberg asked Ensign if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did, but the planes never turned around.",
      "He said he's likely to hold his first hearing on the contempt investigation the week after Thanksgiving.",
      "\"Justice requires me to move promptly on this,\" Boasberg said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:05:13 -0500",
    "summary": "House lawmakers moved quickly to repeal a provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 over phone record seizures. It's unclear what the Senate will do.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House unanimously passed a bill Wednesday to repeal a\u00a0controversial provision\u00a0that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
      "House leaders fast-tracked the bill under suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds majority for passage. The bill easily cleared the lower chamber in a 426 to 0 vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday that he wasn't sure how the upper chamber would approach the legislation, but he defended the provision allowing the lawsuits.",
      "\"The House isn't implicated in what we did. It just simply applies to the Senate,\" he said. \"There's a statute that obviously was violated and what this does is enables people who are harmed \u2014 in this case, United States senators \u2014 to have a private right of action against the weaponization by the Justice Department.\"",
      "The new law requires service providers to notify senators if their phone records or other data are seized or subpoenaed. A court cannot delay notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.",
      "The bill states: \"Any senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any federal department or agency.\"",
      "Senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation under the new law, which also limits how the government can rebut the claims. The law is retroactive to 2022, meaning it would allow at least eight senators to sue the federal government over their phone records being seized during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "The provision was tucked into a yearlong measure to fund the legislative branch, which passed Congress last week as part of a broader package to end the government shutdown. Thune told reporters Wednesday that he takes the fact that some lawmakers were unaware of the provision as a \"legitimate criticism in terms of the process.\"",
      "\"But I think on the substance, I believe that you need to have some sort of accountability and consequence for that kind of weaponization against a co-equal independent branch of the government,\" he added.",
      "As the package moved through the House Rules Committee last week, Democrats tried to amend the bill to remove the provision. Several Republicans on the committee expressed surprise and anger over the provision's inclusion, but said they had to support the overall package to reopen the government because removing it would prolong the shutdown by sending the amended bill back to the Senate.",
      "\"What they did is wrong,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia said last week. \"There's actually a list of people that know they will get paid as soon as this thing is signed \u2014 at least they've got the coupon where all they have to do is go file at the courthouse to get paid.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas called the provision \"self-serving\" and criticized its last-minute insertion into the bill without any debate.",
      "\"It is beside my comprehension that this got put in the bill, and it's why people have such a low opinion of this town,\" Roy said.",
      "Citing the provision, Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, refused to vote for the funding package to reopen the government.",
      "After a conversation with Thune last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the South Dakota Republican \"regretted the way it was done.\" Johnson said the Senate's move was \"way out of line.\"",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said he did not ask Thune to commit to holding a vote in the Senate, but he expected the chamber to do so.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday he met with Thune and hoped the Senate would take up the bill.",
      "\"We'll have that discussion,\" Johnson told reporters.",
      "The Republican senators whose phone records were subpoenaed as part of Smith's election interference investigation were: Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.",
      "Most of the eight senators said they do not plan to seek damages under the new law. And Thune said it isn't about the money, but the principle.",
      "\"I don't think there's anybody that was targeted for whom the money matters,\" he said.",
      "Graham, however, indicated he plans to take action.",
      "\"If you think I'm going to settle this thing for a million dollars \u2014 no,\" he said last week. \"I want to make it so painful no one ever does this again.\"",
      "Still, Thune said \"everybody's focusing on the private right of action,\" but he said \"the important thing in all of this is, where is the accountability and what is the consequence of bad behavior? And if there's no penalty associated with it, you're going to get more of the same.\"",

      "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles after last week's release of emails between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,\" Summers said in a statement.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress,\" he said.",
      "On Wednesday night, Summers went on leave from teaching at Harvard University, with his spokesperson, Steven Goldberg, saying in a statement: \"Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review. His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.\" A Harvard spokesperson said Summers \"communicated his decision\" to the university.",
      "Summers said earlier this week that he will be stepping back from \"public commitments\" after dozens of messages between him and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",

      "Summers joined the OpenAI board in 2023.",
      "The emails showed Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "The exchanges between Summers and Epstein include one in which they appeared to banter about a woman Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer him advice.",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, was a key economic adviser in the Obama administration. The former president of Harvard University, Summers was teaching two classes at the school.",

      "Later in the day, Epstein suggested to the same person that former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler \"would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of Jeffrey.\" A source tells CBS News that meeting never took place.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Ruemmler, who is currently the chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs, was among Epstein's inner circle in the final years of his life. Ruemmler has described it as a business relationship; she is not accused of wrongdoing.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House on Wednesday formally sent to the Senate a bill that would force the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the final procedural move before the legislation can be sent to President Trump for his signature.",
      "After the House passed the measure in a 427-1 vote on Tuesday, the Senate approved the bill unanimously before it could even be formally transmitted from the lower chamber. With the transmission of the bill Wednesday morning, the bill is formally considered passed, and now heads to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "Mr. Trump, who had initially expressed opposition to the release of the files, is expected to sign the measure into law, after he changed his tune Sunday and urged Republicans to vote in favor of the bill.",
      "With his signature, the Justice Department, FBI and U.S. attorney's offices would be forced to release their files related to Epstein, his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and other entities connected to them within 30 days. Survivors' personal information and other sensitive material can be withheld or redacted with explanations to Congress.",
      "A long path to passage",
      "The final hurdles for the bill come months after the effort began. After the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures in July, interest in the files has swelled, sparking widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July that would require the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. And when Congress returned from recess in September, Massie filed a discharge petition to force a vote on the bill, circumventing GOP leadership. The petition, which required 218 signatures, picked up support from all Democrats and four Republicans, but the final signature needed remained out of reach as Rep. Adelita Grijalva's swearing in was delayed during the government shutdown.",
      "Meanwhile, Republican leaders had pushed back on the discharge petition and underlying legislation, warning against the possible release of sensitive information while touting work from congressional committees to look into the Epstein files. But public pressure on lawmakers to force the release of the documents remained high.",
      "Last week, Grijalva was sworn in and became the final signature needed on the discharge petition and force a vote. On Wednesday, after Mr. Trump gave his blessing, the House voted almost unanimously in favor of the measure.",
      "The Senate quickly followed suit, unanimously agreeing to deem the bill passed once it arrived from the House.",
      "A GOP split",
      "The effort, and the Epstein issue more broadly, often divided Republicans, who faced conflicting pressure from constituents and the administration.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at Republicans who pushed to release the files, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a long-time supporter. Mr. Trump reversed his endorsement of Greene, calling her a \"traitor,\" after she called his prior opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "As the bill approached passage on Tuesday, Khanna spoke of the \"extraordinary political consequences\" suffered by Massie and Greene, along with other Republicans who supported the measure. And Greene lamented that the fight over the disclosure of the Epstein files had \"ripped MAGA apart.\"",
      "The issue also seemed to divide GOP leaders. Johnson led the charge against it in Congress. On Tuesday, even as he expressed concerns about the bill, the speaker voted to move it forward, saying that he expected the Senate to amend it and insisting that Senate Majority Leader John Thune do so.

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 20:05:39 -0500",
    "summary": "A judge repeatedly questioned prosecutors about the validity of the indictment returned by a grand jury and its handling by interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department's criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey appears to be on shaky ground as a judge Wednesday repeatedly questioned federal prosecutors about the validity of the indictment returned by a grand jury and how it was handled by interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.",
      "During a hearing on Comey's bid to have the charges tossed on the grounds his prosecution is vindictive and selective, U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff pressed government lawyers for clarity about the events that surrounded the grand jury proceedings on Sept. 25, when it voted to indict Comey on two counts related to testimony he provided to Congress in September 2020. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Halligan had said in a declaration filed with the federal court in Alexandria on Friday that after she made her presentation to the grand jury, it deliberated for roughly two hours. Halligan said she was then informed by her deputy that the grand jury had rejected one count, but voted to indict Comey on two others.",
      "The indictment was then re-drafted to remove the first count, and listed only the two counts that the grand jury approved, Tyler Lemons, a federal prosecutor working on Comey's case, told Nachmanoff on Wednesday. Lemons said a grand-jury coordinator told prosecutors about the outcome of the vote.",
      "Judge has questions about second indictment",
      "But Nachmanoff questioned whether the second indictment \u2014 with only the two charges \u2014 had been presented to the grand jury and voted on, or given straight to a U.S. magistrate judge. That judge, Lindsey Vaala, presided over the return of the indictment and also expressed confusion as to why she was presented with two documents: The indictment with two counts, and a report of the grand jury's failure to concur in an indictment, which lists three counts.",
      "Lemons said the second indictment was given straight to the judge, and argued it was not a \"new\" indictment, but had been edited only to reflect the grand jury's decision to charge Comey with lying to Congress and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.",
      "Nachmanoff pressed Lemons further, asking if the second indictment was never shown to the entire grand jury. The prosecutor said that was correct. Lemons was not at the proceedings before the grand jury in September. Halligan presented the case by herself.",
      "While Lemons answered most of the judge's questions, Halligan briefly appeared before Nachmanoff to tell him that only the foreperson and another grand juror were in the courtroom when the indictment was presented to the magistrate judge.",
      "One of Comey's attorneys, Michael Dreeben, said moments later that the Justice Department had just acknowledged the indictment was never presented to the grand jury and never returned.",
      "\"There is no indictment that Mr. Comey is facing,\" Dreeben said, adding this is a \"threshold basis\" to dismiss the case with prejudice, which would prohibit prosecutors from re-filing charges. He said there should be no charges against his client because the five-year statute of limitations for Comey's alleged offenses has now expired.",
      "Halligan's presentation before the grand jury and her handling of the indictments have puzzled not only Nachmanoff, but two other judges that have presided over different aspects of Comey's criminal case, which remains in its early stages.",
      "A Justice Department official told CBS News Wednesday evening in a statement that \"the Government remains committed to following the law, respecting grand-jury secrecy, and ensuring that judicial decisions rest on facts\u2014not assumptions. The magistrate judge's order does not meet that standard.\"",
      "Earlier hearing raises questions about transcript of Halligan's grand jury presentation",
      "During a hearing last week on a separate legal issue involving Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney, U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie raised what she said was a missing portion of the transcript from the grand jury proceedings.",
      "The judge said it appeared no court reporter was present during part of Halligan's presentation, or did not transcribe the period at issue. Halligan later said in her declaration Friday that the missing portion reflects the time when the grand jury was deliberating, which must be done without any other person in the room, including a court reporter.",
      "\"There are no missing minutes, contrary to the suggestion raised by the court,\" Halligan wrote.",
      "Another judge raises questions about grand jury transcript",
      "But then, on Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick raised his own issues with the \"completeness\" of the transcript and the manner in which the second indictment was presented to the grand jury.",
      "Fitzpatrick said the second indictment was new, and he concluded after reviewing the grand-jury transcript that Halligan would've presented it to the grand jury for consideration before it was returned in open court.",
      "\"It now appears that may not have happened,\" he wrote.",
      "Citing the timeline that Halligan laid out in her filing, the judge said the short time span between when she learned that the grand jury rejected one count in the initial indictment and when she appeared in court to return the second indictment \u2014 which is about seven minutes \u2014 \"could not have been sufficient\" to draft and sign the second document, present it to the grand jury, provide legal instructions and give them a chance to deliberate and render a decision.",
      "\"If the prosecutor is mistaken about the time she received notification of the grand jury's vote on the original indictment, and this procedure did take place, then the transcript and audio recording provided to the Court are incomplete,\" Fitzpatrick wrote in an order. \"If this procedure did not take place, then the Court is in uncharted legal territory in that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.\"",
      "He ordered federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury material to Comey's defense team, and criticized the Justice Department for what he described as a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in its handling of the case.",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote that there is \"the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings.\"",
      "The Justice Department official told CBS News Wednesday that \"the grand jury transcript \u2014 which Magistrate Judge Fitzpatrick read \u2014 speaks for itself. When read in full, it shows no misstatement of law, no improper instruction, and no basis for the extraordinary remedy of breaching grand-jury secrecy. Partial snippets cannot overcome the actual record.\"",

In it, Patel writes: \"I have determined that you exercised poor judgment with an inappropriate display of political signage in your work area during your previous assignment at the Los Angeles Field Office.

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in efforts to strike peace in Sudan amid an ongoing civil war there, at the request of his \"very good friend\" Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement Wednesday as he spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, one day after a lengthy meeting with the crown prince, known as MBS, in the Oval Office. The State Department has already said the U.S. has been working with international partners, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, to broker an end to the war, but the president said he views the situation \"differently now than I did just a day ago.\"",
      "The people of Sudan are suffering from a staggering humanitarian crisis, as the two-and-a-half-year war takes its toll. The power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has displaced millions, sparked famine and led to claims of genocide. Mr. Trump said he wasn't planning to get involved in the yearslong conflict in Sudan, but the crown prince suggested he add Sudan to his list of peace deals he has helped broker. The United Nations says what's happening in Sudan is the greatest humanitarian crisis on Earth.",
      "\"His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,\" Mr. Trump told his audience at the U.S.-Saudi business forum. \"It was not on my charts to be involved in that. ... But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan, and we're going to start working on Sudan.\"",
      "The president's announcement was met with great applause in the room. Mr. Trump said his administration got started on working for peace in Sudan about half an hour after his meeting with MBS concluded Tuesday.",
      "\"And you know we've already started working on that, OK?\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, a State Department spokesperson told reporters the Trump administration was engaging directly with the RSF and the Sudanese army, and called on both sides to \"move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce, given the immediate urgency of de-escalating the violence and ending the suffering of the Sudanese people.\"",
      "But the president's push for action draws more focus to the region, while spotlighting MBS' influence. Mr. Trump has emphasized his excellent relationship with MBS, as well as the \"great wealth\" the Saudis are pouring into the U.S.",
      "MBS announced Tuesday in the Oval Office that a planned $600 billion investment in the U.S. from Saudi entities would be closer to $1 trillion. The two leaders also signed what the president called a \"historic\" and \"strategic\" defense agreement, and the U.S. will be selling the Saudis extensive military equipment.",
      "The crown prince's visit has been filled with fanfare, complete with a military jet flyover, cannon fire and an elaborate White House dinner with some of the richest people in the world. But more meaningful to MBS is what Mr. Trump has said on camera about the leader of the country with a troubled human rights record.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's intelligence agencies in 2018 determining the crown prince ordered the killing of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, Mr. Trump claimed in the Oval Office that MBS \"knew nothing about\" it. The president criticized reporters for asking questions about Khashoggi and Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Families of the victims are suing the Saudi government, and a federal judge reviewing thousands of pages of evidence from the attacks concluded the families can move forward with their case.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",

      "\"The things that have been released have been heavily redacted and, therefore, you know, really not very helpful,\" Farmer said.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, even though the FBI said over the summer that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related materials and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "\"So these files should be available now. They should not be tied up in any kind of investigation,\" she said. \"But we're concerned about things like that, that might get in the way of what we're looking for.\"",

      "Farmer testified at Maxwell's trial in 2021. A key accuser in the trial, Farmer said that she went to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996 hoping he and Maxwell would help with academic endeavors. Farmer told jurors at the trial that Maxwell allegedly massaged her breasts and Epstein climbed into bed with her without her permission.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News reported Maxwell planned to ask Mr. Trump to commute her sentence, according to documents obtained by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"She needs to serve her full sentence,\" Farmer said about Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for her role in the Epstein sex abuse case.",
      "\"She harmed so many more than just individuals that were involved in the trial and so I think to now see her getting this special treatment and potentially be receiving some kind of pardon, it's really unfathomable,\" Farmer said.",
      "In a letter from Democrats to Mr. Trump, which was seen by CBS News, the lawmakers alleged Maxwell was receiving preferential treatment.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "\"I think it's absolutely disgusting that she's getting this preferential treatment,\" Farmer said.",
      "Maxwell's attorneys have denied she is trying to get her sentence reduced and that she is receiving preferential treatment, saying, \"It is clear that no effort to fact check the credibility or veracity of the so-called 'whistleblower' was made.\"",
      "Justice and healing",
      "Farmer said what justice looks like is \"a complicated question.\"",
      "\"A big part of it is just recognition of what actually happened here,\" she said.",

    "summary": "President Trump plans to seal major business and security deals during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's White House visit.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, to the White House with an elaborate military display Tuesday, praising the crown prince and insisting the U.S.-Saudi relationship has never been better as the two countries look to sign major business and national security deals.",
      "The pomp and circumstance \u2014 and the president's praise and warmth toward MBS \u2014 were more typical of a visit from an allied Western democracy than an absolute monarchy with a troubled human rights record, pointing to the president's focus on economic and business ties above virtually all else. The White House sees Saudi Arabia as a critical security partner in a turbulent Middle East, as well as an economic partner.",
      "The White House arrival ceremony for the crown prince on Tuesday morning was laden with fanfare, complete with a U.S. military flyover, cannons, horses, and a red carpet. American and Saudi flags adorned the White House South Lawn, and a military band greeted the Saudi royal. Mr. Trump and the crown prince exchanged greetings as they shook hands, and then watched the formation of F-35 and F-16 fighter jets fly by before going inside the White House.",
      "The crown prince's meeting with the president concluded and MBS departed the White House Tuesday afternoon, though he returned later in the evening for a black-tie dinner in his honor. Guests spotted at the dinner included Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Saudi team Al-Nassr.",
      "Ahead of bin Salman's arrival, Mr. Trump\u00a0told reporters\u00a0Monday that the U.S. would sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis. In the Oval Office, MBS said the Saudis will increase a planned investment of $600 billion in the U.S. to closer to $1 trillion, an announcement that pleased Mr. Trump greatly.",
      "Mr. Trump praised the crown prince in the Oval Office, calling him a \"very good friend\" and insisting his record on human rights is commendable, despite the State Department's long list of concerns of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Arbitrary and unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, serious restrictions on freedom of expression and restrictions on religious freedom continue to plague the nation, according to the latest 2024 State Department report.",
      "The trip to the White House is the crown prince's first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing, during Mr. Trump's first term, that the crown prince had\u00a0ordered it.",
      "Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he\u00a0told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell\u00a0in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview, \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "The Biden administration later released the Trump-era intelligence report concluding the crown prince \"approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\"",
      "Bin Salman was asked about Khashoggi directly in the Oval Office Tuesday, giving U.S. reporters a rare chance to question the future king. \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose,\" MBS said.",
      "The crown prince sought to distance the Saudi government from the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, as families of the attacks criticize the White House for inviting him. Bin Salman said he feels \"painful about families of 9/11 in America,\" but claimed Osama bin Laden used the Saudi people to \"destroy\" the American-Saudi relationship. Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years, drawing\u00a0vehement denials\u00a0from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized members of the media for some of the questions.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",
      "Later in the day Tuesday, the crown prince attended a dinner at the White House. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening's dinner is a perfect example of why his large ballroom under construction is necessary. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "Asked about the potential conflicts of interest given his family business ties, Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday,\"I have nothing to do with the family business.\"",
      "\"They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually, I'm sure they could do a lot,\" Mr. Trump said of his family.",
      "Criticism of human rights record",
      "Following the killing of Khashoggi, Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince. Whitson mentioned the \"fist bump seen around the world,\" as former President Joe Biden warmly greeted Khashoggi in Riyadh during his presidency \"hat in hand.\"",
      "\"We went from the Biden administration narrowly sanctioning Mohamamd bin Salman himself for the murder of Khashoggi \u2026 to now welcoming him into Washington and not only sort of feting him for whatever lucrative deals he can pass to American businesses, but also to potentially actually help as a stabilizing force,\" Whitson said.",
      "Aaron  Navarro and \n                                                  \n                                  Ed  O'Keefe\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "title": "Study on breast cancer and birth control shows how science can be distorted",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-birth-control-study-science/",
    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The study sought to answer questions about how breast cancer risk differs by type of hormonal contraceptive. Doctors say the results won't change how they counsel patients.",
    "story": [
      "As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.",
      "The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.",
      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/largest-spider-web-discovered-cave-greece-albania-border/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:12:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun.

    "story": [
      "A woman has pleaded guilty to falsely reporting that her astronaut ex-wife committed a crime while deployed to the International Space Station.",
      "Summer Heather Worden, 50, told law enforcement in July 2019 that her former spouse had illegally accessed her bank account earlier that year while she was in space, according to a news release from the Department of Justice. Her wife, previously identified as astronaut\u00a0Anne McClain, was at the ISS from December 2018 to June 2019. It was the first allegation of a crime being committed in space.",
      "An investigation by NASA's Office of the Inspector General found that Worden had opened the bank account in April 2018 and that both she and McClain had access to it until January 2019, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found that Worden had regularly given McClain access to her bank records, including login credentials, from at least 2015, the news release said.",
      "McClain said in 2019 that she had accessed the bank account with Worden's permission, The New York Times reported. Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, disputed that claim and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. A complaint filed to NASA's Office of Inspector General by Worden's family accused McClain of identity theft and improper access.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 03:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Sentinel-6B is the second of two satellites in a $1 billion program to monitor sea levels over a full decade.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "St. Germain said NASA's share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday, referring to the company's proprietary superchips that power large language models.",
      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",

    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-ftc-whatsapp-instagram/",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:05:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The government's latest jobs data could affect whether Federal Reserve officials continue their push to ease borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "Just a few weeks ago, a December interest rate cut was viewed as practically a done deal by many economists. Now, with fresh government data showing solid U.S.\u00a0job growth in September, many forecasters think the Federal Reserve is likely to hold off lowering borrowing costs when policy makers meet next month.",
      "The probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut now stands at 22%, down from a likelihood of 97% as of mid-October, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. CME Fedwatch, a tool that forecasts rate cuts based on changes in the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, gives slightly better odds of a reduction, at about 41%.",
      "Translation: Wall Street economists and traders alike expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged at its next two-day meeting on Dec. 9-10. That would amount to a pause in the central bank's recent move to lower lending rates, coming after two consecutive cuts in September and October.",
      "The shift in expectations for future Fed rate cuts follows a six-week blackout in federal economic data because of the\u00a0government shutdown, a hiatus that hindered the central bank's ability to assess key economic trends. Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark federal funds rate \u2014 or what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 if officials conclude that the job market and broader economic growth are in danger of stalling. But Thursday's jobs data showed that employers continued to hire at a healthy clip in September.",
      "\"Given that today's numbers were not a bad as feared, in conjunction with hawkish statements from the Fed recently, it does appear that the Fed will skip a cut in December,\" Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar, said in an email.",
      "He added, \"But with the negative trend in labor markets remaining in place, we'd expect the Fed to resume cutting in their next meeting in January 2026, if they don't cut this December.\"",
      "The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 3.75% to 4%.",
      "A move by the Fed to dial back rate cuts in 2026 could keep borrowing costs for homes and cars elevated. Pricier mortgages and auto loans are also reinforcing the feeling among many Americans, reflected in sentiment polls, that the cost of living remains too high.",
      "Mixed economic picture",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment in check. The central bank cited the slowing labor market when it twice trimmed borrowing costs this fall.",
      "But the latest payroll gains released Thursday showed that employers hired 119,000 people in September \u2014 more than double what most economists had forecast. The nation's unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%, the highest level since October of 2021. The increase in the jobless rate suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "At the same time, inflation has edged up, climbing at an annual rate of 3% in September. That puts pressure on the Fed to keep price increases from spiraling higher, with some policymakers expressing concern over persistent inflation.",
      "The mixed economic picture is complicated by the absence of more recent official data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said\u00a0this week that it will fold some October jobs data into its November report, which is set for release after the Fed's next meeting, on Dec. 16.",
      "\"September's payroll numbers may have surprised to the upside, but in terms of the Fed's December interest rate decision, October is what mattered,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in an email. \"With that data now delayed until after the FOMC meeting, the Fed's rate-cut path has more question marks.\"",
      "She added, \"Overall, the available economic data has supported a December cut, but given the Fed's cautious bent, it may choose to wait until it has more numbers in hand.\"",

      "If you\u00a0don't have a Real ID\u00a0the next time you fly, it could cost you.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration has proposed a rule that would charge travelers who lack a Real ID an $18 fee at security checkpoints, according to a\u00a0notice\u00a0published Thursday in the Federal Register.",
      "\"This notice serves as a next step in the process in REAL ID compliance, which was signed into law more than 20 years ago and finally implemented by Secretary Noem as of May 2025,\" a TSA spokesperson told CBS News, noting that the agency would soon provide additional guidance. \"TSA is working with stakeholders and partners to ensure both security and efficiency at our checkpoints.\"",
      "Embracing biometrics",
      "The TSA is launching a biometric identity verification program at its checkpoints to screen individuals who don't have a Real ID or other suitable alternative form of identification, such as a passport.",
      "Alternative ID verification methods are \"time and resource intensive,\" the TSA said in proposing the fee.",
      "\"To address the government-incurred costs, individuals who choose to use TSA's modernized alternative identity verification program will be required to pay an $18 fee,\" the agency's proposed rule states.",
      "Verifying people's identity at the nation's airports \"is the first step in the physical screening process at a TSA security checkpoint and the last link in intelligence-based traveler prescreening, ensuring that high-risk travelers are identified. ...\" the proposal states.",
      "The TSA said that biometric verification, which it also refers to as a registered traveler program, will streamline the process of identifying passengers.",
      "Passengers will start incurring the $18 fee when the TSA announces that individuals may register for the alternative identity verification program at TSA.gov.",
      "Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, thinks the fee proposal is reasonable, given that travelers have had ample time to obtain a Real ID.",
      "\"For years, they've been saying either get a Real ID or a passport or don't travel,\" he told CBS News. \"So the idea that you can pay $18 and potentially travel anyway isn't so unreasonable.\"",
      "Check your driver's license bureau",
      "The TSA began requiring passengers to\u00a0present a Real ID\u00a0or other approved documents in May. The enhanced form of identification can either be a driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card.",
      "\"The fact that TSA is floating an identity-verification fee suggests things are tightening,\" said Sarah Silbert, a strategist at flight search engine Points Path. \"If you haven't updated your ID yet, it's smart to take care of it soon, especially with peak travel season adding extra stress for everyone.\"",

      "\"Once we determine that, then they'll be able to develop an inspection plan,\" Moore said at a news conference in Louisville. \"Can we inspect it? If so, how do we repair it? How do we put it back together? And then eventually return the fleet to service. But that's not going to happen quickly.\"",

    "story": [
      "A stepsibling of 18-year-old Anna Kepner is being investigated for possible involvement in the Florida teen's death on a Carnival cruise ship earlier this month, a law enforcement source and a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Kepner's family believes her 16-year-old stepbrother is a suspect in an FBI investigation, according to court filings from a custody hearing obtained by CBS News. The court filings refer to the stepbrother as \"T.H.\"",
      "\"There is an open investigation regarding [Kepner's] death\u2026 and T.H. is a suspect regarding this death which occurred recently on a cruise ship,\" according to a filing Kepner's stepmother, Shauntel Hudson, entered in the circuit court of Brevard County, Florida, on \u00a0Nov. 18.",
      "The filing came in response to one entered by Hudson's ex-husband a day earlier amidst their custody dispute of their children, which also asserted the 16-year-old is a suspect.",
      "The FBI has not named anyone as a suspect in this case, and in a statement, the FBI said it does not provide operational updates on its investigations except in rare circumstances.",
      "One law enforcement source said the two stepsiblings may have had some kind of altercation.",
      "Kepner was on a family vacation in the Caribbean with her father, stepmother and three stepsiblings when she was discovered dead on the Carnival Horizon as it was headed back to Miami, where it docked on Nov. 8. Her body was found by a housekeeper under the bed in her stateroom, law enforcement sources told CBS News.",
      "Kepner was staying in the same room as her stepbrother and one other stepsibling.",
      "CBS News has confirmed the time of death listed by the medical examiner is 11:17 a.m. on Nov. 7; a source familiar with the investigation says this is around the time Kepner's body was discovered.",
      "According to family members, Kepner had told them the night before that she wasn't feeling well and returned to her room. When she didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, a frantic search began.",
      "CBS News reported Tuesday that an unrelated court filing suggested charges may be coming against one of Kepner's stepsiblings. That disclosure appeared in a motion made by Kepner's stepmother, Shauntel Hudston, to reschedule a divorce hearing due to the matter.",
      "\"An extremely sensitive and severe circumstance has arisen wherein the Respondent/Mother will not be able to testify at the hearing at this time,\" the filing stated.",

      "Investigators are now reviewing surveillance video from the ship and analyzing electronic swipe card data that may show who entered the teen's cabin, the law enforcement sources said. They are also examining Kepner's cellphone records. The FBI and ship security are also conducting interviews with other passengers, crewmembers and Kepner's family.",
      "In a statement, Carnival Cruise Line said it is cooperating with the federal investigation. The FBI has jurisdiction because Kepner is a U.S. citizen and the death occurred in international waters. The Miami FBI office is working closely with Carnival security.",

    "summary": "Security cameras capture the ambush shooting of Nicole \"Nicki\" Lenway while on her way to pick up her 5-year-old son.",
    "story": [
      "Who wanted Nicki Lenway dead? That was the question police were asking on the evening of April 20, 2022. Around 7:30 p.m., Lenway had pulled into the parking lot of FamilyWise parenting center to pick up her 5-year-old son, Callahan. She was halfway between her car and the door when she was ambushed from behind and shot multiple times at point-blank range.",
      "Miraculously, Lenway survived, telling \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty, \"I fell to the ground. ... And the shooter stands over me and continues to try to shoot.\" The mystery of who tried to kill Lenway is unraveled in \"Who Wanted Nicki Lenway Dead?\"\u00a0A 30-minute encore airs Saturday, Nov. 22, at a special time \u2014 10:30/9:30c \u2014 following the NWSL Championship on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "After firing at Lenway \u2014 hitting her in the arm and neck \u2014 the shooter fled. Left bleeding and struggling to breathe, Lenway called 911, but when the operator answered Nicki realized she was unable to speak.",
      "Nicki Lenway was no stranger to violence. The 33-year-old worked crime scenes for the Minneapolis Police. But she never imagined she'd find herself on the other side of an investigation. \"I knew that this could happen \u2026 but I didn't want to believe it would,\" she tells Moriarty.",
      "Across the street from where Lenway was gunned down, Emilie Clancy was in her car at a red light and had witnessed the whole thing. \"There was, um, a person who ran up to another person. \u2026 I heard two bangs and that other person collapsed,\" she said. When the light turned green, Clancy pulled up next to Lenway. Clancy took over the 911 call and had Lenway get into the front seat of her car. She took off her jacket and placed it over Lenway's neck to try and help stop the bleeding.",
      "As the two women waited for help to arrive, they shared a powerful moment Clancy will never forget. \"I just looked her in the eyes. \u2026 And I said, 'Nikki, we've got this. We've got this. Just stay with me\u2026' I just wanted her to know that she wasn't alone in this \u2026 And if that was the only thing I can give to this poor girl, like that \u2014 that would mean something to me.\" Within minutes, first responders arrived, and Lenway was rushed to a local hospital in critical condition.",
      "Police began their investigation into who committed the brazen attack by scouring the area for clues. They learned Lenway had been at FamilyWise to pick up her son who had a scheduled visit with his father, her ex-boyfriend, Tim Amacher. Officers spoke to Amacher in the lobby of FamilyWise and found out he had been inside the building with his son when the shooting took place.",
      "The first big break in the case came when officers discovered there was security footage from FamilyWise and two surrounding buildings. The first images showed Nicki arriving to pick up her son and someone dressed in all black with a mask over their face running her down from behind. Another camera, from a bank across the street, captured the dramatic moment the shots were fired. The shooter could then be seen fleeing on foot and driving off in a black Dodge Ram truck. But the truck had no license plates, and police couldn't tell who was behind the wheel.",
      "The next day, police were able to interview Lenway in the hospital. They asked if she had any idea who would want to kill her. Without a second thought, she told them she was convinced Amacher was involved. Amacher was a well-liked local taekwondo instructor. For police, it didn't make sense that Amacher could have been the shooter. They knew Amacher was inside Family Wise at the time of the shooting and couldn't have pulled the trigger.",
      "Still, Lenway told police she and Amacher had a long and rocky history that included allegations of abuse \u2014 \"One night he threw me against the wall holding my neck\" \u2014 and a bitter custody battle over their son that eventually went to trial in the fall of 2020. When it was over, the judge awarded Lenway sole legal and physical custody. Tim was allowed just one supervised visit a week. For police, it was a clear motive.",
      "But what about Amacher's alibi? Could police connect him with the shooting? One of the detectives at the crime scene had asked Amacher what cars he owned. Amacher told him he owned the Jeep he was driving and a Dodge Challenger sedan. But the detective didn't just take his word for it, and when he checked with Driver and Vehicle Services, he made a shocking discovery. Tim Amacher owned another vehicle: a Black Dodge Ram truck, just like the one the shooter was seen driving off in.",
      "If it was Amacher's truck, who was driving it? Police looked to the FBI for help, and agent Richard Fennern, a technology specialist, was assigned to the case. Amacher's truck was a newer model and Fennern learned it had Wi-Fi, which,\u00a0just like a cellphone, creates a digital trail. \"We could track it much like we could a cellphone,\" said Fennern.",
      "Using data from Tim's truck and his cellphone records from earlier in the day before the shooting, Fennern concluded the black Dodge Ram truck the shooter drove off in was in fact the same truck Tim Amacher had been driving earlier. It was a huge break. But it still left police with the same question \u2014 who was the masked person driving it away from the scene after shooting Nicki?",
      "Police would question Amacher, and he told them the only other person who had access to his truck was Colleen Larson. Larson was younger than Amacher \u2014 she had been his taekwondo student since she was an adolescent. When she was 18 years old, she moved in with the taekwondo master and their relationship would eventually become romantic. Neighbor Charlie Dettloff told Moriarty, \"She would call him Master ... and ultimately kinda became, you know, like a maid or a servant to him.\"",
      "Police questioned Larson twice. The first time she denied any involvement, but during the second interview, which was recorded, she broke down and confessed: \"I took the truck and I drove over there \u2026 and then I shot her.\"\u00a0 Even though Larson admitted to pulling the trigger, she said the whole thing was Amacher's idea.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: So, he asked you, if you felt comfortable would you shoot Nicole for me?",
      "COLLEEN LARSON: Yeah.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Yes.",
      "Larson told police that after the shooting she got rid of the black clothes she wore to disguise her identity, but Amacher had disposed of the gun.",
      "COLLEEN LARSON: He just said he would take care of it.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: He just said he would take care of it. \u2026 So, you have no idea what he did with the gun?",
      "COLLEEN LARSON : Not exactly, no.",
      "Despite what Larson told police, Amacher denied any involvement before or after the shooting. Tim Amacher went on trial on Nov. 3, 2022. He was found guilty of premeditated attempted murder and aiding his accomplice, Colleen Larson, and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. A few days later, Larson pleaded guilty to first-degree premeditated attempted murder. She was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:51:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is pushing to remove Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.",
    "story": [
      "A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official testified Thursday about the steps the Trump administration has taken to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the West African country of Liberia, as the Trump administration continues its push to remove him from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over Abrego Garcia's challenge to the administration's efforts to deport him, had ordered the immigration official, John Cant\u00fa, to testify in-person. Cant\u00fa is a top official at Enforcement and Removal Operations at ICE and had submitted to the court a declaration about a discussion between the State Department and the Costa Rican government about possibly accepting Abrego Garcia, as well as his potential deportation to Liberia.",
      "Cant\u00fa said that if the Trump administration had the green-light to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S., the government would schedule a commercial flight or charter a plane bound for Liberia. He said that the Liberian government provided assurances to the State Department that Abrego Garcia would not be persecuted, tortured or sent back to El Salvador.",
      "Asked about the declaration filed with the court, Cant\u00fa said he included in it information that was provided to him by the State Department.",
      "Abrego Garcia has designated Costa Rica as a country he is willing to be deported to. An order from Xinis has been in place since August that prevents the Trump administration from deporting Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",
      "But earlier this month, the Trump administration urged\u00a0Xinis to lift that order\u00a0and allow the government to remove him to Liberia, arguing that the administration has gone through all the necessary steps to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has been a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown since the Salvadoran immigrant was removed from where he lived in Maryland to his native country in March. He was sent to El Salvador even though in 2019, an immigration judge granted him a legal status known as withholding of removal because of concerns Abrego Garcia could be persecuted by gangs there.",
      "He faces deportation proceedings because he entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011.",
      "In June, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after he was detained in El Salvador's notorious mega-prison to face two felony charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.",
      "Before Abrego Garcia's criminal trial is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to several African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.",
      "The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, was interviewed in October by a U.S. government asylum officer, and that officer determined that he failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia. The Justice Department said any additional due process would be unwarranted.",
      "Abrego Garcia's \"claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,\" the Justice Department said in its filing. \"This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.\"",
      "In addition, the Justice Department submitted declarations from U.S. officials stating that Liberia has made \"sufficient and credible\" assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be harmed there or removed from Liberia to another country where he potentially could be persecuted.",
      "In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on \"a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,\" following a U.S. request.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture. They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.",
      "They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.",
      "\"The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,\" the attorneys said in a response to the Justice Department's motion.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also asked Xinis to keep her block on his deportation in place \"unless and until an immigration judge concurs\" with the Trump administration's determinations.",

No border agent operations will occur on Thursday, a news release from the sheriff's office said.",
      "\"It is important to clarify that while the 'Charlotte's Web' operation has ended, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will continue to operate in Mecklenburg County as they always have,\" the news release said. \"ICE maintains full authority to detain, apprehend, and take into custody any undocumented immigrant in accordance with federal law.\"",
      "A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately respond Thursday to an Associated Press email seeking a response about the sheriff's statement.",
      "The operation that began in Charlotte over the weekend led to hundreds of arrests, according to authorities. It was part of President Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts, which have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities, from Chicago to Los Angeles.",
      "The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday. Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said on X that \"border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended\" in the city.",
      "The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond was about double the total announced by Homeland Security officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies \"continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.\" Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.  Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge. The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.",
      "Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 12:10:03 -0500",
    "summary": "More than a dozen ancient canoes uncovered in a Wisconsin lake offer insights into prehistoric Indigenous transportation practices and traditions, archaeologists said.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have discovered 16 ancient canoes left behind by Indigenous people along the shore of a Wisconsin lake, in what they described as the prehistoric version of a modern-day docking station for shared electric bicycles.",
      "The locations of the canoes were carefully mapped as archaeologists identified each of them, submerged in Lake Mendota in Wisconsin's capital city, over a period of several years, the Wisconsin Historical Society announced Wednesday.",
      "Tamara Thomsen, the state's maritime archaeologist, discovered the first 1,200-year-old dugout canoe in Lake Mendota in 2021 and has been studying the site ever since, according to the historical society.",
      "Thomsen said that the site lies near a network of what were once indigenous trails. They were likely not owned by individuals but shared among a community and left in those locations so that people could pick them up and use them as they traveled, the historical society said, likening the practice to community bike sharing programs that \"utilize docking stations for users to store bikes between riders.\"",
      "\"It's a parking spot that's been used for millennia, over and over,\" Thomsen said.",
      "Lake Mendota is a sprawling, 15-square-mile body of water on Madison's west side. The state Capitol building and the University of Wisconsin-Madison are located on an isthmus that runs between it and Lake Monona, a 5-square-mile lake to the east.",
      "After the first canoe was found 24 feet below the surface of Lake Mendota in 2021, archaeologists went on to uncover the remains of a 3,000-year-old canoe, a 4,500-year-old canoe, and a 2,000-year-old canoe during their explorations the following year. Those discoveries suggested to researchers that there was probably more to the site than they expected.",
      "Working with Sissel Schroeder, a UW-Madison professor who specializes in Native American cultures, and preservation officers with the Ho-Chunk Nation and the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Thomsen has now located the remains of 12 additional canoes, Thomsen said.",
      "\"The canoes give us insight into a sophisticated travel network and interconnected communities who used their incredible skills and knowledge to live and thrive on lands where we still live and thrive today. They reflect a deep relationship with the environment and the ingenuity of our ancestors,\" said Larry Plucinski, of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, in a statement. \"Sharing what we learn from this project honors the innovators whose knowledge lives on and inspires new generations to feel pride for their ancestors.\"",
      "Radiocarbon dating shows the oldest of the 16 canoes dates back to 5,200 years ago, making it the third-oldest canoe discovered in eastern North America, she said. The two oldest were found in Florida, with the oldest of them dating back 7,000 years, Thomsen said.",
      "Wisconsin experienced a drought beginning about 7,500 years ago and lasting to around 1000 B.C., Thomsen said. The lake in the area where the canoes were found was probably only 4 feet deep over that period, she said, making it a good place to disembark for foot travel. The canoes likely were shared among community members and stored at designated points like the Lake Mendota site. Users would typically bury the canoes in sediment in waist- to chest-deep water so they wouldn't dry out or prevent them from freezing, Thomsen said.",
      "Travelers may have been headed to Lake Wingra, a 321-acre lake on Madison's south side, Dr. Amy Rosebrough, the state archaeologist, said. The Madison area is part of the ancestral homeland of the Ho-Chunk Nation, which views one of the springs that feeds Lake Wingra as a portal to the spirit world, she said.",
      "\"The canoes remind us how long our people have lived in this region and how deeply connected we remain to these waters and lands,\" Bill Quackenbush, the Ho-Chunk's tribal preservation officer, said in a news release.",
      "Thomsen speculated that if the drought did begin 7,500 years and archaeologists are finding canoes beneath other canoes, they may eventually find a 7,000-year-old canoe in the lake. That could mean Indigenous people that predated many of Wisconsin's tribes may have used the lake, she said.",
      "Thomsen spends most of her days uncovering Great Lakes shipwrecks and works on the canoe project only one day per week. But she called that work the most impactful she has ever done as an archaeologist because she engages with Wisconsin tribes, learns their history and tells their stories.",
      "\"I think I've shed more tears over this,\" she said. \"Talking with the Indigenous people, sometimes I sit here and just get goose bumps. It just feels like (the work is) making a difference. Each one of these canoes gives us another clue to the story.\"",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, marking a pickup after previous employment data had shown a slowdown in hiring. The report marks the first official job tally since the\u00a0government shutdown ended last week, ending a six-week blackout on labor data.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 50,000 jobs in September, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since Oct. 2021. With robust job growth in September, that suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "The Labor Department also revised job growth down for July and August by a combined 33,000, a sign that hiring during those months was weaker than previously reported.",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest boost in jobs, with 43,000 hires in September. The federal workforce, meanwhile, lost 3,000 jobs that month.",
      "Investment advisor firm Capital Economics estimates 150,000 federal workers will drop off the government's payroll in the fourth quarter this year, mainly due to the end of the Trump administration's deferred resignation programs.",
      "The job market has been losing momentum for much of this year, with previous employment reports indicating a slowdown in hiring. At the same time, employers have been announcing layoffs in recent months, leading to the worst October for job reductions in 22 years, according to\u00a0outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Verizon said it would lay off 13,000 employees on Thursday. That follows major recent job cuts by\u00a0Target, Amazon, UPS\u00a0and other major companies.",
      "What it means",
      "The September employment figures suggest job growth remains firm amid concerns that the labor market was at risk of stalling.",
      "\"The September jobs report may be backward-looking, but offers reassurance that the labor market wasn't crumbling before the government shutdown,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Although job growth has weakened, \"it is not collapsing,\" added Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, thinks the odds of a rate cut have \"diminished significantly\" given there will not be a full October employment report and the November report won't be issued until after the Fed meets in December.",
      "Ashworth expects the Fed to delay its next rate cut until January. The probability of a rate cut now stands at 22%, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Delayed employment reports",
      "The September jobs report, originally slated for Oct. 3, was pushed back by the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. The delay means it offers a belated snapshot of the labor market just before federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it won't publish the full October employment report, which was originally slated for release on Nov. 7. Instead, the agency will fold select October data into the November report, which is set for release on Dec. 16.",

    "summary": "The proposed changes include the elimination of the \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's administration moved Wednesday to roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live, reviving a suite of changes to Endangered Species Act regulations from the Republican's first term that were blocked under former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "The proposed changes include the elimination of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process.",
      "The administration's announcement answers longstanding calls for revisions to the Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. The president has voiced frustration with the\u00a01973 law\u00a0and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Critics argue the landmark 1973 environmental law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth.",
      "But environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the\u00a0monarch butterfly, Florida\u00a0manatee, California spotted owl\u00a0and North American wolverine.",
      "Scientists and government agencies say extinctions are accelerating globally because of habitat loss and other pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump has made oil and gas production a centerpiece of his presidency and sought to strip away environmental regulations that impede development. Other pending proposals from the administration would revise the definition of \"harm\"\u00a0under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \"the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\"",
      "\"These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\" Burgum said in a statement.",
      "Another proposed change tasks officials with analyzing economic impacts when deciding whether habitat is critical to a species' survival.",
      "In April, a White House official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump planned to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live. The president\u00a0directed\u00a0agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "Case of lizard shows potential outcome of proposals",
      "The case of the Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Southwest exemplifies the potential consequences of the proposals. Rapidly warming temperatures have ravaged a population of the lizard in Arizona's Mule Mountains, pushing the reptiles further up the mountainsides toward the highest peaks and possibly toward extinction.",
      "A petition filed Wednesday seeks protections for the lizard and the designation of critical habitat. Advocates say analyzing the economic impacts could delay protections. Designating critical habitat could be another hurdle because the primary threat to this population of spiny lizard is climate change.",
      "\"We think that the species should be listed as endangered. In fact, we are somewhat shocked that it is not already extinct,\" said John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, who co-authored the petition.",
      "The move comes 18 months after\u00a0CBS News first reported\u00a0on the lizard's disappearance from much of its historic range. At that time, Wiens and our team hiked to the top of the Mule Mountains under ideal weather conditions for finding lizards but found none.",
      "But Wiens, whose scientific protocol requires multiple surveys, returned twice more and both times found about a half-dozen on a few scattered rock outcrops near the summit.",
      "\"You have to go back. You have to be rigorous,\" Wiens told CBS News.",
      "The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts.",
      "Species designated as \"threatened\" under the rule automatically qualify for the same protections as those with the more severe designation of \"endangered.\"",
      "PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \"necessary course correction.\"",
      "\"This reform acknowledges the blanket rule's unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\" Wood said.",
      "Proposals would undermine protections, critic says",
      "Kristen Boyles with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the changes undermine protections even more than in Mr. Trump's first term. That includes allowing the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to not count negative effects on species if those impacts are not regulated by the agencies themselves, Boyles said.",
      "\"The Services are required to prevent harmful consequences to species, not ignore them,\" she said.",
      "Trump officials during his first term also rolled back protections for individual species including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf.",
      "The spotted owl decision was reversed in 2021 after officials said Mr. Trump's political appointees used faulty science to justify opening millions of acres of West Coast forest to potential logging. Protections for wolves across most of the U.S. were restored by a federal court in 2022.",
      "The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. In the more than 50 years since the law was enacted, the\u00a0act has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish:\u00a0salmon\u00a0and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",
      "Last month, an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that arctic seals\u00a0are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of\u00a0bird species\u00a0around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion. One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said as it released its latest\u00a0Red List of Threatened Species.",

      "A growing online gun rights movement known as \"3D2A,\" and the accessibility of 3D printers, have sparked an explosive growth of ghost guns in New York City \u2014 and could soon spread across the nation, the New York City Police Department said.",
      "Ghost guns are mostly\u00a0assembled from kits composed of separate parts ordered online, with no registration information, making them practically untraceable. But over the last year, engineers and hobbyists have upped the ante, and law enforcement has seen an increase in the use of 3D printers to create almost every part of the weapon. The plans are readily available online, with engineers competing with each other to both make ever better designs and to circumvent emerging legislation designed to crack down on ghost guns.",
      "\"We see the speed and tension that's picking up within those communities on the internet and we definitely see this as something that is going to grow into something we're trying to stay ahead of,\" said Courtney Nilan, the NYPD's ghost gun czar, who said she is paying particularly close attention to the 3D2A movement.",
      "\"3D\" refers to the 3D printers used to make the guns, and \"2A\" stands for the Second Amendment. The movement's adherents include members of the far left, far right and anarchists, and it's been difficult to pin them down to a specific ideology beyond a push for absolute freedom to make ghost guns, regardless of how powerful.",
      "One of the more recent models of 3D-printed ghost guns is known as \"Not a Glock,\" which has a feature that can turn it into an automatic weapon, firing multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger.",
      "Some of these 3D printed guns and add-on parts have already been used in high-profile crimes. When UnitedHealthcare CEO\u00a0Brian Thompson\u00a0was fatally shot in December 2024, prosecutors say alleged gunman Luigi Mangione used a ghost gun with a 3D-printed silencer. Mangione has since become a sort of folk hero in the 3D2A online community.",
      "A massive movement",
      "The number of 3D-printed ghost guns recovered by local law enforcement around the country is small compared to ghost guns assembled from kits and ordered by mail. But the prevalence of 3D-printed firearms has been surging. More than 30 3D-printed guns were recovered in 2020. By 2024, that figure had climbed above 300,\u00a0according to gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "By comparison,\u00a019,000 ghost guns total, mostly assembled from kits, were recovered by law enforcement in 2021 alone.",
      "But experts on the hunt for ghost guns are most worried about what 3D printers will do next.",
      "Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, whose office recovered 42% of the ghost guns found in New York City last year, said 3D-printed guns can be made, \"almost anywhere at any time with an item that you can easily buy anywhere.\"",
      "3D printers are now in most city schools, and they can be purchased for as little as $200 online.",
      "\"These guns are being used more and more in other types of crimes, drive-bys, robberies and homicides,\" Katz said.",
      "New York has some of the strongest gun control laws in the nation, but 3D-printed ghost guns are still finding their way onto city streets. Nilan, who serves as deputy chief of intelligence and leads a unit of detectives dedicated to tracking down ghost guns in the city, pointed to the increasing frequency of the recovery of ghost guns as proof of the accessibility of making and producing these firearms.",
      "\"They're circumventing a lot of these laws,\" Nilan said, partly due to the 3D printers and a growing online gun movement called 3D2A.",
      "The 3D2A community often spouts anti-government views and presents itself as defenders of personal liberties and the Second Amendment.",
      "\"It's a massive movement,\" Nilan said, adding the online group seems to be a place that attracts people with extreme views. Some are engineers and all are dedicated, Nilan said, to working \"together to perfect a design for a new model 3D-printed firearm.\"",
      "Many 3D2A adherents believe the freedom to 3D print should be maximized. Loosely assembled online, 3D2A uses a firearm design platform known as \"The Gatalog,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the Global Network on Extremism and Technology, a research group based out of King's College London in the United Kingdom.",
      "Researchers said 3D2A community members \"taunt and poke fun at those who attempt to dismantle their underground weapons development.\"",
      "\"Readily Available\"",
      "Guns can be built using a 3D printer almost anywhere, said Victor Cardona, a former New York cop who now provides training on issues surrounding ghost guns.",
      "One 2023 study found more than 2,100 3D-printed firearm plans online, including plans housed on mainstream platforms like Google Drive and the software development platform GitHub.",
      "\"These plans to print these guns are readily available,\" Cardona said.",
      "In addition to having access to the plans, someone could easily purchase a 3D printer to set up at home, with prices ranging from $200 to $3,000. The gun design file would then just need to be downloaded and sent to print. Newer 3D printers are also now capable of printing more parts than older models, said Cardone, such as springs, \"moving more and more away from actual metal components\" that would have been necessary in previous years.",
      "Young people could also potentially have access to the plans and the printers in schools. Through pop culture, they can be inspired to try to mimic and make guns seen in video games, on social media and on television, Cardona said.",
      "The easy access for young people is apparent to law enforcement trying to keep New York City safe, said Nilan. More than 20% of ghost guns made by 3D printers are found in the hands or homes of those under 18, Nilan said.",
      "\"You need to know what your children are doing online. And I know we hear that for so many different realms, but this is very important. This is very important for safety,\" she said.",

      "Seattle \u2014 Washington state's governor declared an emergency Wednesday to ensure enough jet fuel gets to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport after a leak shut down a major fuel pipeline.",
      "The order temporarily waives and suspends state regulations limiting the number of hours commercial vehicle operators can drive when transporting jet fuel, Gov. Bob Ferguson's office said in a news release. The proclamation ensures safe-driving measures are in place, the release said.",
      "\"This declaration will help the airport maintain its fuel supply while the pipeline is offline and limit disruptions to travelers,\" Ferguson is quoted as saying.",
      "The Olympic Pipeline was shut down on Nov. 11 because of a leak north of Seattle, between the cities of Everett and Snohomish. Operators notified the state of the leak and were working with state and federal agencies to contain, clean and repair it, the governor's office said.",
      "There was no estimate for when the pipeline would resume delivering fuel normally. But if it doesn't start back up by Saturday, the governor's office said airport operations would be \"significantly affected.\" The office didn't share details on what that impact would look like.",
      "The airport \"has limited fuel on hand to sustain operations,\" the governor's office said, and since last week, airport officials have told incoming flights to fuel up to capacity before arriving because of the pipeline shutdown. That practice, Ferguson's office notes, is known as \"ferrying fuel.\"",
      "The 400-mile-long Olympic Pipeline is operated by BP Pipelines North America, Inc. It carries gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum products from refineries in northwest Washington to points in Washington and Oregon.

      "Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida was indicted in federal court Wednesday for allegedly stealing millions of dollars in federal emergency funds and routing some of it to her campaign account, the Justice Department said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department alleged that in 2021, a year before Cherfilus-McCormick was elected to Congress, a health care company that she ran was overpaid $5 million on a Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded contract related to coronavirus vaccinations. The defendants in the case allegedly \"conspired to steal\" the money by sending it through multiple accounts.",
      "Some of that overpaid money was then used to help fund Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign to represent South Florida in the House, the Justice Department alleged. In particular, she was accused of funneling some of the money to friends and family members who donated it to her campaign, in what's known as a \"straw donor\" scheme.",
      "\"Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.\"",
      "The Justice Department's statement did not specify the charges against Cherfilus-McCormick or any other defendants. An indictment for Cherfilus-McCormick was not posted on the federal court database as of Wednesday evening.",
      "\"This is an unjust, baseless, sham indictment \u2014 and I am innocent,\" Cherfilus-McCormick said in a statement provided to CBS News early Thursday morning. \"The timing alone is curious and clearly meant to distract from far more pressing national issues. From day one, I have cooperated with every lawful request, and I will continue to do so until this matter is resolved. I am deeply grateful for the support of my district, and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I look forward to my day in court. Until then, I will continue fighting for my constituents.\"",

      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters late Wednesday that he would issue a statement on the criminal charges after speaking with Cherfilus-McCormick, but added: \"She's innocent until proven guilty.\"",

    "story": [
      "One day after a Trump-appointed federal judge helped toss out Texas' redistricting effort, a Reagan-appointed judge penned a heated and invective-filled dissent accusing his fellow jurist of \"cherry-picking of the highest order.\"",
      "A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 on Tuesday that Texas must set aside the new congressional maps that it drew earlier this year, with Judge Jeffrey Brown writing for the majority that the map \u2014 which would create five new GOP-friendly House seats \u2014 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling was issued by Brown and Judge David Guaderrama, nominated to the bench by President Trump and former President Barack Obama, respectively. The state of Texas quickly\u00a0appealed the ruling\u00a0to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The ruling could upend this year's nationwide redistricting gambit. Multiple states have followed Texas' lead and redrawn their maps, including California, which made five congressional districts more friendly to Democrats in response.",
      "The panel's third member, Judge Jerry Smith, filed his response on Wednesday, writing the phrase \"I dissent\" some 16 times over the course of his 104-page opinion.",
      "Smith, nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987, accused the two other judges of issuing the ruling without giving him enough time to respond, which he called an \"outrage.\" He wrote that in the days prior to the ruling, Brown sent him a pair of drafts that were more than 160 pages long, only offered a few days to react, and didn't wait for Smith to write his dissent.",
      "\"In my 37 years on the federal bench, this is the most outrageous conduct by a judge that I have ever encountered in a case in which I have been involved,\" Smith wrote.",
      "The dissent \u2014 which started by warning readers, \"Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night!\" \u2014 also attacked the opinion itself in often-harsh terms. He called Brown an \"unskilled magician,\" compared his reasoning to a \"bizarre multiple-choice question from hell,\" and called the ruling the \"most blatant exercise of judicial activism that I have ever witnessed.\"",
      "At one point, when discussing the court's decision to grant a preliminary injunction, Smith writes: \"If this were a law school exam, the opinion would deserve an 'F.'\"",
      "Race or politics?",
      "At the heart of Smith and Brown's disagreement is whether Texas lawmakers redrew the state's House districts for partisan reasons or racial reasons.",
      "The map-drawing effort began after Mr. Trump and his allies pushed Texas officials over the summer to create as many as five new GOP-leaning seats, as Republicans fight to hold onto a razor-thin House majority in next year's midterms.",
      "At one point during that gambit, Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, sent Texas Gov. Greg Abbott a letter alleging that a handful of the state's existing districts were illegal \"coalition\" districts where non-Hispanic White voters are in the minority but no single racial group has a majority.",
      "Tuesday's majority opinion, penned by Brown, said that Abbott \"explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race\" and \"repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts.\"",
      "The court concluded that the state's redistricting effort was unconstitutional because it was driven by racial considerations, not pure politics. It's legal for lawmakers to redraw maps for partisan reasons, Brown wrote, but racially gerrymandered maps can be challenged in court.",
      "Smith disagreed, pointing to evidence that he said shows the new Texas maps were actually driven mainly by partisan politics rather than race.",
      "The judge cited testimony from one of the mapmakers, Adam Kincaid, who explained at length why he made certain decisions to shift around the boundaries of congressional districts. Smith said Kincaid \"had a perfectly legitimate and candidly partisan explanation for his every decision.\"",
      "Smith also noted at one point that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who pushed to redraw his state's maps in response to Texas, \"took a victory lap\" after this week's ruling.",
      "\"That tells you all that you need to know\u2014this is about partisan politics, plain and simple,\" Smith said.",
      "In response Wednesday night, Newsom wrote on X: \"This judge says California's redistricting in response to Texas was overwhelmingly partisan. Yes, ours was. That was the ENTIRE POINT!\"",
      "Smith claimed the \"main winners from Judge Brown's opinion are George Soros and Gavin Newsom.\" He alleged Soros, the liberal megadonor, and his son, Alex Soros, \"have their hands all over this,\" claiming several lawyers and experts for the plaintiffs have links to groups that have received funding from the Soros family's Open Society Foundations.",
      "And Smith warned that, if the decision stands, it could disrupt next year's congressional races.",
      "\"As a legal and practical matter, Judge Brown's injunction turns the Texas electoral and political landscape upside down,\" he said. \"It creates mayhem, chaos, misinformation, and confusion.\"",
      "The League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the plaintiffs, said Smith's claim that the redistricting was purely political is \"flatly contradicted by the record.\" The group also rejected Smith's claim that the ruling would lead to \"chaos,\" saying the \"true risk would be allowing an unlawful, racially discriminatory map to stand.\"",
      "\"Protecting voters from racial discrimination is not activism; it is a constitutional obligation,\" LULAC CEO Juan Proa\u00f1o said. \"The majority acted responsibly to uphold the law and safeguard the rights of millions of Texans.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said Wednesday he has signed a bill that requires the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Wednesday he has signed a bill that requires the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days, after months of controversy that ended with the House and Senate passing the bill by nearly unanimous margins this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the bill-signing in a Truth Social post that lashed out at prominent Democrats with links to Epstein.",
      "\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump endorsed the legislation over the weekend, after a handful of House Republicans joined with Democratic lawmakers and forced the House to hold a vote. The legislation passed the House 427-1 on Tuesday and moved through the Senate unanimously.",
      "Mr. Trump's support for the bill marks an about-face after the president had urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue for months, calling the push for more federal records on Epstein to be released a distraction tactic.",
      "Maria Farmer, who accused Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, of sexual abuse in the 1990s, said the bill-signing was a \"long time coming.\"",
      "\"I have waited nearly three decades for answers about how my reports of abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were investigated by federal authorities,\" she said in a statement. \"After being left in the dark for decades, having my repeated calls for transparency and action ignored, and living through nearly five administrations that turned a blind eye to this enormous travesty of justice, Congress finally listened to survivors.\"",
      "Farmer is currently suing the FBI, which she alleges ignored her initial sexual assault accusation. She said Wednesday that the bill's passage \"doesn't absolve the government and law enforcement's enormous failure to do its job the past 30 years.\"",
      "\"I hope to see the government make good on its promise of transparency and release the entirety of the files \u2013 not bits and pieces, not mass redactions but the complete truth, removing only child sexual abuse material and victim names and identifying information,\" she said.",
      "What will the Epstein files bill do?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to make public all of the Justice Department and FBI's unclassified records, communications and investigative materials related to Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Maxwell.",
      "It's not clear what new documents will emerge, but Epstein and Maxwell were at the center of a series of federal investigations dating back nearly two decades. Tens of thousands of pages of records on their cases have been released by lawmakers in recent months, including files held by the government and Epstein's estate.",
      "Epstein was initially investigated by federal and local authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended with him controversially agreeing to plead guilty to state prostitution charges in exchange for avoiding a federal indictment. Then, in 2019, he was charged in New York federal court with sex trafficking of minors, but he died by suicide while in federal custody. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking a year later and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The case has drawn years of public fascination, including speculation and conspiracy theories spurred by Epstein's extensive ties to wealthy and powerful people. Democrats have criticized Mr. Trump for his yearslong friendship with Epstein, while Mr. Trump has scrutinized former President Bill Clinton for his relationship with the late financier. Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and representatives for Clinton say he was not aware of Epstein's crimes. Neither Mr. Trump nor Clinton has been accused of illegality or charged with a crime, and both have denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The Trump administration has faced calls from both sides to release more information on Epstein \u2014 and criticism from its own allies after some administration officials had promised further disclosures.",
      "In February, Bondi gave out binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" to a group of right-wing influencers, but she faced backlash after the influencers said much of the information was already public.",
      "Five months later, the Justice Department and FBI finished a review of the Epstein case and concluded that there was no incriminating \"client list,\" no evidence that he blackmailed prominent people and no evidence that would support an investigation into anybody else. The review also found that he died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019. Some Trump supporters were dissatisfied and unconvinced by the findings.",
      "The push to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act was led by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie. Seeking to navigate around GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson's skepticism of the bill, the pair circulated a \"discharge petition,\" a procedural move that requires the House to vote on a bill if a majority of its members sign on.",
      "The petition drew support from four Republicans, including Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a onetime Trump ally who has increasingly broken with her party in recent weeks. Mr. Trump announced last week he was withdrawing his endorsement of Greene, which the Georgia lawmaker speculated was driven by the Epstein issue.",
      "For weeks, the petition sat at 217 signatures \u2014 one short of the number needed to force a vote \u2014 as newly elected Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva awaited her swearing-in ceremony after winning her seat in a September special election. Democrats accused Johnson of slow-walking Grijalva's swearing-in due to the Epstein bill, but Johnson said the delay was because the House remained out of session during the government shutdown.",
      "Grijalva signed the petition last week, forcing the House to hold a vote. Within days, Mr. Trump encouraged House Republicans to vote for the bill, leading it to pass easily on Tuesday.",

    "summary": "The strikes have come amid a broader buildup of U.S. military forces in the Caribbean as the Trump administration continues to put pressure on Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday offloaded a nearly 50,000-pound haul of cocaine worth more than $360 million, bringing it onshore at Port Everglades in southern Florida..",
      "\"It's the most cocaine ever seized by a single cutter in one deployment. So business is good,\" Adm. Nathan Moore, the commander of Coast Guard Atlantic Area, said in his first network interview.",
      "But despite recent U.S. air and missile strikes on what the Trump administration says is cartel smuggling infrastructure, the Coast Guard has not seen \"any noticeable difference\" in the flow of cocaine, Moore said.",
      "\"I would just tell you that the drugs you see here on [Cutter] Stone \u2014 most have been seized in September, October and even early in the month of November. So business is good for us and we are continuing to enjoy success\" in intercepting drug vessels.",
      "According to Moore, there have been no major changes in traffickers' routes or pace, or in drug purity. The U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes targeting alleged drug-ferrying boats off South America since September as part of a wider anti-drug offensive.",
      "But Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole says the strikes are having a measurable impact.",
      "\"You're starting to see the rise in the price of cocaine,\" Cole told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "\"Cocaine is getting more expensive. And I think what it is \u2014 not only more expensive in the U.S., but we're seeing it become more expensive at first stops. So more expensive in Puerto Rico, more expensive in the Dominican, more expensive once it lands in Guatemala and Honduras and Central America.\"",
      "Cole said the DEA has seen an increase in the price of cocaine of 30% to 45% per kilogram.",
      "\"It's now more expensive to recruit boat captains, it's more expensive to purchase engines, it's more expensive to build larger boats for transportation,\" he added. \"And this is all due to immense pressure.\"",
      "There has also been a recent surge in Coast Guard drug seizures, which Moore attributes to upgraded cutters like the Stone, as well as tighter integration with U.S. intelligence agencies and new autonomous surveillance tools.",
      "The strikes have come amid a broader buildup of U.S. military forces in the Caribbean as the Trump administration continues to put pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom the administration has repeatedly accused of being the head of a drug trafficking operation. President Trump on Monday said he would not rule out sending American troops to Venezuela.",
      "\"I don't rule out anything,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just have to take care of Venezuela.\"",
      "Moore, who was recently nominated to become deputy commandant for operations of the U.S. Coast Guard, said traffickers are adapting, but not slowing down.",
      "\"It's a cat-and-mouse game,\" Moore said. \"We have success in one area, they shift tactics \u2026 and then we shift to counter that.\"",
      "The Coast Guard previously announced multiple drug interceptions in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean this year, including what had been the previous record haul in August.",
      "Mr. Trump recently called maritime interceptions \"totally ineffective,\" but Moore Cole pushed back on that skepticism.",
      "Moore said the Coast Guard remains \"a tool in the nation's tool bag\" that delivers disproportionate impact when deployed against large, long-range cocaine shipments.",
      "\"We'll continue to keep immense pressure on every trafficking route,\" said Cole, adding, \"We're going to apply every single tool to stop the narcotics from coming into the United States and killing American citizens. And I think the strategy of an all-hands approach \u2014 the military, intel \u2014 it's making a difference.\"",
      "Cole also dismissed concerns that the strikes on alleged drug boats were weakening the U.S.'s relationship with some of its allies, including France, Mexico and Colombia, which threatened to cut off some intelligence sharing with the U.S. over the strikes.",
      "\"There's no shortage of intel sharing back and forth between countries, and neither country wants to see these problems that we're now seeing unfold in Mexico \u2014 with the fentanyl trade with China, with the precursor chemicals. None of these countries want those problems there,\" he said.",
      "Moore acknowledged that some drug-trafficking boats do not get caught, but said that the Coast Guard strategy \u2014 pushing operations far offshore \u2014 keeps much of the flow from ever reaching U.S. shores.",
      "Looking ahead, Moore said he expects next year to be even busier in terms of drug seizures.",
      "\"We don't see any indication that the business will slow down,\" Moore told CBS News. \"I think 2026 looks even better than 2025.\"",
      "Asked what he would say to Americans who feel like the boat strikes are ineffective at reducing the amount of drugs entering the U.S., Cole pointed to what he said was a 30% increase in drug seizures.",
      "In fiscal year 2025, the Coast Guard intercepted 231,000 kilograms of cocaine, the highest haul on record and more than triple the yearly average. Moore told CBS News he expects that number to grow in the future.",
      "\"The American citizens are sick and tired of Americans dying at the hands of the cartels,\" said Cole. \"We are laser-focused on protecting our citizens and defending our national security.\"",

      "Messages from the tranche of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents released by Congress on Nov. 13 shed new light on the deceased sex offender's effort to court billionaire Bill Gates.",
      "The newly released material from 2017 shows a series of text messages between Epstein and an apparent adviser to Gates, discussing the tech baron and other attendees at an annual banquet in Washington.",
      "Epstein had been hoping to sell Gates on a donor-advised fund, a tax-deductible charitable vehicle Epstein wanted to operate, but that never ultimately materialized.",
      "Gates was interested in the idea, the adviser said, but for the misgivings of one person who didn't want him communicating with Epstein: Gates' then-wife Melinda.",
      "\"He wants to talk to you but his wife won't let him,\" the adviser said. In a series of texts a minute later, the adviser said of Gates, \"he loves you,\" \"he says hi,\" and \"he feels bad about the [donor advised fund] btw He thought great idea but wife wouldn't allow.\"",
      "Later in the day, Epstein suggested to the same person that former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler \"would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of Jeffrey.\" A source tells CBS News that meeting never took place.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Ruemmler, who is currently the chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs, was among Epstein's inner circle in the final years of his life. Ruemmler has described it as a business relationship; she is not accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Requests for comment sent to Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates were not immediately returned. The couple divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.",
      "A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment Wednesday. In October, they told CBS News that Ruemmler's relationship with Epstein was related to her work for her previous employer, the law firm Latham & Watkins.",
      "The Microsoft founder and philanthropist has previously sought to minimize his connection to Epstein, saying in 2019, \"I didn't have any business relationship or friendship with him.\" In 2021, after it became clear that Gates and Epstein had met repeatedly in the decade before Epstein's 2019 death, Gates called spending time with Epstein a \"huge mistake.\"",
      "Epstein's appointment calendar, released by Congress in September, shows several meetings with Gates, who previously said he had met with Epstein while seeking contributions and connections for his global health philanthropy.",
      "Gates is among a slew of famous and powerful people who have long sought to publicly downplay their connections to Jeffrey Epstein. In some cases, documents have come to light showing they in fact had more involved relationships than they've acknowledged.",
      "Epstein was a prolific networker who sought to build relationships with world leaders, business titans and celebrities, often casting himself as a middleman who could connect the powerful.",
      "His ability to build an elite social circle continued even after he had become a registered sex offender,\u00a0 following a 2008 deal with prosecutors in Florida that allowed Epstein to plead guilty to lesser state charges. He then was able to return to his globetrotting life.",
      "As cache after cache of Epstein's personal communications, flight logs and calendars have come out, many of his friends and acquaintances have faced blowback. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles following newly surfaced communications between him and Epstein.",

      "Both chambers of Congress passed a bill that would force the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files following President Trump's signature.",

      "The Senate unanimously approved the Epstein Files Transparency Act to compel the documents release, following the House's 427 to 1 vote. The passage comes after months of opposition by many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, who recently changed his stance.",
      "\"I think that they felt pressure to get on the right side of history here because it was becoming so clear that this wasn't going away, that people cared about it,\" Farmer said.",
      "\"I feel hopeful\"",
      "Now, Farmer is hopeful for transparency, adding Tuesday's moment was bittersweet because of what it took to get there.",
      "\"I feel hopeful not because I have a lot of trust in the political process, but because of what I've seen, what is possible when people come together and demand something and pressure is placed by the American people here,\" she said. \"I appreciate everyone who spoke out about this.\"",
      "But she admitted she still has concerns about getting full transparency.",
      "Farmer's sister, Maria, who is also a survivor of Epstein's abuse and was one of the first in 1996 to report it to law enforcement, has made Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to investigations of Epstein over the years.",
      "\"The things that have been released have been heavily redacted and, therefore, you know, really not very helpful,\" Farmer said.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats, even though the FBI said over the summer that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related materials and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "\"So these files should be available now. They should not be tied up in any kind of investigation,\" she said. \"But we're concerned about things like that, that might get in the way of what we're looking for.\"",
      "Maxwell's sentence",
      "Farmer testified at Maxwell's trial in 2021. A key accuser in the trial, Farmer said that she went to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996 hoping he and Maxwell would help with academic endeavors. Farmer told jurors at the trial that Maxwell allegedly massaged her breasts and Epstein climbed into bed with her without her permission.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News reported Maxwell planned to ask Mr. Trump to commute her sentence, according to documents obtained by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"She needs to serve her full sentence,\" Farmer said about Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for her role in the Epstein sex abuse case.",
      "\"She harmed so many more than just individuals that were involved in the trial and so I think to now see her getting this special treatment and potentially be receiving some kind of pardon, it's really unfathomable,\" Farmer said.",
      "In a letter from Democrats to Mr. Trump, which was seen by CBS News, the lawmakers alleged Maxwell was receiving preferential treatment.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "\"I think it's absolutely disgusting that she's getting this preferential treatment,\" Farmer said.",
      "Maxwell's attorneys have denied she is trying to get her sentence reduced and that she is receiving preferential treatment, saying, \"It is clear that no effort to fact check the credibility or veracity of the so-called 'whistleblower' was made.\"",
      "Justice and healing",
      "Farmer said what justice looks like is \"a complicated question.\"",
      "\"A big part of it is just recognition of what actually happened here,\" she said.",
      "She said her sister Maria hasn't been given any protections as a whistleblower and has been threatened.",
      "\"I think just the acknowledgment that, 'wow, what you did was so brave and this didn't need to happen.' That there have been mistakes made over and over by law enforcement that we don't want those things to continue happening,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Kyiv said it plans to \"work on points of the plan.\" it received from the U.S. that's aimed at restarting diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a draft plan aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, his office confirmed Thursday.",
      "It said in a statement that he had \"officially received a draft plan from the American side, which, according to the American side, could activate diplomacy.\" The statement went on to say \"it was agreed to work on the points of the plan in such a way as to bring the war to a dignified end.\"",
      "A senior White House official confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that President Trump was backing a 28-point plan drafted by envoy Steve Witkoff and an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war Russia started nearly four years ago with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it's not clear whether this plan is the one that Zelenskyy received.",
      "The plan, according to reports by Axios, the Financial Times and the New York Times, calls for Ukraine to abandon territory, give up some weapons and shrink its army, and while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the war must end, he reiterated that from Kyiv's perspective, \"there can be no reward for waging war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the plan was first reported by NBC.",
      "Previously, Ukraine has agreed with the U.S. to a freezing of the battle lines where they stand as a starting point for negotiations, while also making clear that it needs security guarantees from Washington and its Western partners.",
      "In an interview with Axios on Monday, Kirill Dmitriev, an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff had written a 28-point peace plan during a face-to-face visit last month in Miami.",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions, which had to be waived for him to travel to Florida to meet with Witkoff.",
      "The White House official who spoke with CBS News on Thursday said Witkoff had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and said that he consulted with both the Russians and Ukrainians to take their feedback into account. The extent of those consultations with Ukraine was not clear from Kyiv's statement Thursday, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the same day that Witkoff and Rubio \"met with some of the Ukrainians just in the past week to discuss this very plan.\"",
      "Senior Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov was verbally briefed in Miami this week by Witkoff, a source familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "Top European Union official Kaja Kallas, when asked Thursday if Europeans were involved in the process, responded, \"Not that I know of.\" She also reiterated a point that's consistently been made by Ukraine and its supporters that \"for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"",
      "Witkoff and Dmitriev have been talking for weeks about a proposal to end the war, gaming out ideas even as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury chief Scott Bessent criticized Russia, saying Moscow was not serious about ending the war.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X\u00a0Wednesday. \"And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CBS News Wednesday that he didn't have any announcements to share about a peace plan, but said it was an issue \"the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal.\"",
      "The recent U.S. sanctions appear to be taking a toll on Russia \u2014 a Treasury Department analysis Thursday indicates that the oil sanctions have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine. The U.S. gas sanctions against Russia go into effect Friday.",
      "Amid the U.S. diplomatic efforts \u2014 which include a visit to Kyiv this week by a delegation led by the U.S. Army secretary \u2014 Russian missiles have continued to pummel Ukraine.",
      "Rescuers were still searching on Thursday for victims of a devastating Russian strike on an apartment building in the western city of Ternopil that killed at least 26 people, including three children, according to Ukrainian authorities.",
      "Shrieking Russian missiles slammed into the building on Wednesday, burning at least 19 people to death in the apartments.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/moss-study-space-reproduce-earth/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:56:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

      "Dozens of gold coins from the Roman period were stolen when a Swiss museum was robbed this week, police said Thursday, adding that the value of the bounty was still being calculated.",
      "The Roman Museum in the western city of Lausanne was just about to close for the day on Tuesday when two men who had entered earlier after purchasing tickets jumped a security guard, Lausanne police said in a statement.",
      "\"The two individuals assaulted and overpowered the guard. They then broke into a secured display case and stole several gold coins that were displayed inside,\" before fleeing, the statement said.",
      "The 64-year-old security guard had activated the museum's panic alarm, triggering a rapid response by law enforcement, police said. But the perpetrators remained at large.",
      "The guard, who was the only museum employee present at the time of the robbery, was \"safe and sound\" despite the circumstances, they said.",
      "An effort was underway to determine the exact number of items stolen, the statement said.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A web of undersea cables connects our lives and our global economy. As U.S. adversaries are accused of sabotage, they're proving to be targets of choice.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Over 95% percent of the world's internet traffic and voice and communication data flows through a vast network of fiber optic cables laid across the floors of oceans and seas. The cables are faster, more reliable and cheaper data carriers than alternatives such as satellites, and they have become indispensable to modern life.",
      "They are the veins and arteries that link our deeply interconnected world, transmitting data for everything from sensitive government and military information and text messages between friends, to trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day, underpinning the global economy.",
      "But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.",
      "Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing \"hybrid warfare\" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.",
      "\"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.",
      "He said that sabotaging \"critical nodes on which society functions\u2026 [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years.\"",
      "Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has regularly conducted military strikes against Ukrainian energy and transport facilities. But beyond the battlefield, Russia has also been accused of targeting the infrastructure \u2014 including undersea cables \u2014 that's vital to other countries, including many of the United States' NATO allies.",
      "\"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. \"They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action \u2014 not just against Ukraine, but also against the West.\"",
      "Russia has denied allegations of interfering with undersea cables and called accusations it has carried out acts of sabotage in Europe \"Russophobia.\"",
      "What is happening in the Baltic Sea?",
      "The Baltic Sea is a nearly enclosed body of water surrounded by eight NATO countries and Russia.",
      "Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.",
      "\"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.",
      "And Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.",
      "When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a \"NATO lake.\" Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.",
      "\"It is clearly a spike,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month.\"",
      "Targeting the \"anthropogenic shell of modern society\"",
      "RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked about how the so-called anthropogenic shell of modern society \u2014 basically the fragile infrastructure on which it depends \u2014 is its Achilles heel,\" he told CBS News earlier this year. \"Attacks on undersea cables are one major part of that, along with missile attacks (like on infrastructure in Ukraine) and cyberattacks.\"",
      "Landsbergis told CBS News that he believes Russia's objective in disrupting undersea cables is to intimidate local populations, as well as to \"test the reactions \u2014 you know, how do politicians react? How do militaries react? Whether there is a response or not.\"",
      "With the Trump administration pushing hard for its European NATO allies to rely less on the U.S. for their security, \"it's not the question about how we see NATO, but it's the question how Putin sees NATO,\" Landsbergis told CBS News.",
      "He said without a firm, unified response to the sabotage, Putin could determine \"NATO is not the alliance that it has been before Trump,\" and that could lead the Russian autocrat to \"say, OK, maybe this is the time that I intend to test it.\"",
      "What is NATO doing about it?",
      "At the start of this year, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" a new operation \"to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure.\"",
      "\"By working together with all Allies, we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement announcing Baltic Sentry in January.",
      "The operation involves maritime patrols, aircraft and naval drones, as well as national surveillance assets, according to NATO. The Alliance said it would also work with industry to improve the resilience of undersea cables.",
      "Sweden, another country that shares a Baltic coastline with Russia, broke with its centuries-old policy of military non-alignment and became NATO's newest member last year, in direct response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It staged military exercises earlier this month to practice countering covert espionage and sabotage missions carried out by adversaries in the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" Swedish submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg told CBS News during the exercise.",
      "Wallenburg said the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a face off that never quite turned into a full-scale military conflict.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "Below is a look at some recent incidents in the Baltic Sea in which Russia-linked vessels have been alleged to have been involved in damaging, or seen loitering around, undersea cables.",
      "Case study: Eagle S",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, an electricity cable and four telecommunications cables linking Finland and Estonia suffered unplanned outages, reducing the two countries' interconnectivity. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation later discovered a 60-mile drag mark near the Estlink 2 cable.",
      "The Eagle S, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of the Cook Islands and officially registered to a UAE company, left Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga on the morning of the outages, with its destination listed as Turkey, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic.",
      "The ship sailed over one of the Estlink submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland around the time a power failure was reported by the country's electric grid operators.",
      "The ship's anchor was later discovered near the point where the drag mark ended.",
      "Finnish border guards detained the ship and its crew, led by a Georgian national.",
      "The Eagle S was released to international waters in March, but Finland pursued criminal charges against the crew. The case was dismissed in October, when the court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove intent, but prosecutors said they would appeal.",
      "Case study: Two Russian trawlers tracked in area when Svalbard cable cut",
      "In February 2022, Norwegian police told local media they believed \"human impact\" was to blame for damage to one of a pair of undersea telecommunications cables connecting the country's mainland with its northern archipelago of Svalbard a month earlier.",
      "Space Norway, which operates the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, told CBS News the two cables \u2014 which were laid as a redundant pair in the event one suffered damage \u2014 are the world's northernmost subsea cable systems.",
      "Space Norway said it detected an outage in the Greenland Sea on Jan, 7.",
      "The damage occurred in an area where the cables descend steeply from a depth of 980 feet to nearly 9,000 feet, the operator told CBS News.",
      "Generally, the cables are buried approximately six feet deep, although there may be variations due to the nature of the seabed, the state-owned company explained, while declining to go into detail about the seabed conditions where the damaged cables were buried.",
      "There was never a loss of service for users in Svalbard, a Space Norway spokesperson said, and the investigation into the cut was eventually closed due to a lack of evidence.",
      "But a report from Norway's public broadcaster NRK and open-source information showed Russian fishing trawlers made more than a dozen passes over the area before the damage occurred.",
      "Other evidence of \"hybrid warfare\"",
      "This week, Poland's top diplomat accused Russia of carrying out an \"act of state terror\" by blowing up a railway line over the weekend.",
      "\"It was an act of not only subversion, as happened before, but an act of state terror as its clear intention was to cause human casualties,\" Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said.",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainian citizens believed to have been working with Russia's secret services were suspected of carrying out the attack, which he called an \"unprecedented act of sabotage.\"",
      "The explosion took place on a rail line linking the Polish capital, Warsaw, to Ukraine, and Polish officials said it was used to transport aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia dismissed allegations that it was involved in the explosion, calling them \"Russophobia.\"",
      "\"The latest sabotage in Poland that could have become a mass casualty event brings even more heightened dimension to the debate,\" Landsbergis told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"Imagine if there would be 100 casualties \u2014 would we be still talking about hybrid? Or we would drop the hybrid and just call it war and ask for Article 5?\" Landsbergis said, referring to the mutual-defense agreement among NATO members. \"The question points to a fact that Russians are pushing the escalation lines even further, forcing us to ask ourselves: Aren't we at war already?\"",
      "The incident came amid a spate of airspace violations, including some near airports and military bases, in Western European nations, usually involving unidentified drones, but also, in at least two instances, Russian warplanes.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa's wind gusts reached a record-breaking speed shortly before the storm made landfall in the Caribbean last month, according to data recorded during the deadly event.",
      "The data was collected when a NOAA Hurricane Hunter airplane dropped a fleet of weather instruments into the raging storm, according to a news release from the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research. The devices, called dropsondes, have small parachutes attached and between two and four readings per second before falling into the ocean.",
      "Dropsondes are the only devices that can record information on pressure, temperature, humidity and wind at once. The data is used in forecasts and weather warnings, including emergency alerts.",
      "\"When you're looking at a category 4 or 5 hurricane, you're not going to have an airplane flying that close to the surface \u2013 that would be totally unsafe \u2013 but you need to know what is happening near sea level because that's where people and property are most affected,\" said NSF NCAR engineer Terry Hock, who manages the Dropsonde program, in the news release. \"The dropsonde gets you information you can't get any other way and that's why it's been around for decades.\"",
      "One dropsonde used during Hurricane Melissa clocked a wind gust of 252 miles per hour shortly before falling into the ocean.",
      "NOAA researchers contacted the NSF NCAR to confirm that it was the highest wind speed ever recorded by a dropsonde.",
      "\"NOAA looped us in when they saw the high wind speed and asked, 'Are these numbers any good?'\" said Holger V\u00f6mel, an NSF NCAR senior scientist who works with the organization's Dropsonde Program.",
      "To verify the data, V\u00f6mel and other researchers reviewed the numbers with a quality control software. They also confirmed that the reported 252 mile wind gust would have been physically possible, and that it tracked with the hurricane's behavior, as well as previous storm patterns. The review confirmed that the wind gust measurement was accurate.",
      "The previous fastest wind gust recorded by a dropsonde was in 2010, when Typhoon Megi unleashed a 248 mile per hour blast while over the western Pacific Ocean. During Hurricane Katrina, researchers thought they had recorded an even stronger gust, but the data had substantial issues, the NSF NCAR said.",
      "\"They have pilots and researchers literally putting their lives on the line to get these measurements. They're the heroes, and it's a privilege we get to play a role in making sure the measurements they acquire are accurate,\" V\u00f6mel said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/australia-social-media-ban-children-meta-warns-kids-delete-accounts/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 07:19:14 -0500",
    "summary": "As Australia's world-first ban on under-16s using social media looms, Meta becomes the first big tech firm to warn young users to save their info and sign off.",
    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia\u00a0\u2014 Technology giant Meta on Thursday began sending thousands of young Australians a two-week warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect.",
      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\"We will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \"so we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\"",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia's population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \"video selfie,\" Meta said.",
      "Terry Flew, co-director of Sydney University's Center for AI, Trust and Governance, said such facial-recognition technology had a failure rate of at least 5%.",
      "\"In the absence of a government-mandated ID system, we're always looking at second-best solutions around these things,\" Flew told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Social media companies will face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (about $33 million) if they are found to be failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Meta's vice president and global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said she would prefer that app stores including Apple App Store and Google Play collect the age information when a user signs up and verifies they are at least 16 years old for app operators such as Facebook and Instagram.",
      "\"We believe a better approach is required: a standard, more accurate, and privacy-preserving system, such as OS/app store-level age verification,\" Davis said in a statement.",
      "\"This combined with our investments in ongoing efforts to assure age \u2026 offers a more comprehensive protection for young people online,\" she added.",
      "Dany Elachi, founder of the parents' group Heaps Up Alliance that lobbied for the social media age restriction, said parents should start helping their children plan on how they will spend the hours currently absorbed by social media.",
      "He was critical of the government's only announcing on the complete list of platforms that will become age-restricted on Nov. 5.",
      "\"There are aspects of the legislation that we're not entirely supportive of, but the principle that children under the age of 16 are better off in the real world, that's something we advocated for and are in favor of,\" Elachi said. \"When everybody misses out, nobody misses out. That's the theory. Certainly we expect that it would play out that way. We hope parents are going to be very positive about this and try to help their children see all the potential possibilities that are now open to them.\"",
      "There was significant resistance to the legislation last year, however, including from some children's advocacy groups.",
      "Mat Tinkler, CEO of Save the Children Australia, said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0a year ago, when the ban was approved by Australian lawmakers, that while he welcomed the government's efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than a blanket ban.",
      "He said the government should \"instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits.\"",
      "The\u00a0Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, also expressed \"serious reservations\" over the law before it was approved, saying last year that there were \"less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies.\"",

      "A Chinese drug trafficking suspect who escaped custody in Mexico only to be recaptured in Cuba has been turned over to the U.S. to face charges he trafficked large quantities of cocaine and fentanyl into the country.",
      "Zhi Dong Zhang, also known as \"Brother Wang\" among other aliases, pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment Wednesday in Brooklyn federal court. His lawyer declined to comment following the court appearance.",
      "Federal officials say Zhang ran a vast drug trafficking and money laundering operation that imported thousands of pounds of narcotics into the United States and other countries.",
      "\"The defendant stands accused of running a global enterprise that pumped massive quantities of cocaine, fentanyl, and methamphetamine into our communities and laundered millions in narcotics proceeds,\" U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement. \"His return to the United States is a major step in dismantling a network that has fueled addiction, violence, and death.\"",
      "Zhang's criminal organization operated out of Mexico going back at least to 2016 and laundered its drug proceeds through shell companies created in the U.S. using false social security numbers and other fraudulent documents, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Officials identified more than 100 shell companies tied to Zhang's organization that were used to launder at least $77 million in narcotics proceeds, they said.",
      "Mexican authorities captured Zhang in Mexico City in October 2024 at the request of the U.S. government, but a judge granted him house arrest and he escaped the home where he was being held under military guard. Prosecutors say in court filings that he was eventually recaptured in Cuba and sent to the U.S. by Mexican authorities on Oct. 23.",
      "Last month, Mexican Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch\u00a0posted a photo on social media, showing a handcuffed Zhang next to an airplane, escorted by Interpol agents.",

      "Government documents filed in that case describe a cocaine and fentanyl trafficking network with hubs in the Atlanta and Los Angeles metro areas.

    "story": [
      "Taipei \u2014 Images of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te holding a plate of sushi were posted on social media on Thursday in a show of support for Tokyo after reports that China will halt Japanese seafood imports.",
      "The row between Japan and China was triggered by new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggesting this month that Tokyo could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.",
      "China claims democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring the self-ruled island under its control.",
      "Lai, an outspoken defender of Taiwan's sovereignty who is often sharply criticized by Chinese officials for his stance, has accused Beijing of \"severely\" affecting regional peace in the escalating spat.",
      "A photo of a smiling Lai holding a plate of sushi was posted on his Facebook page.",
      "\"Today's lunch is sushi and miso soup,\" a message posted with the photo said, along with the hashtag #Yellowtail from Kagoshima and scallops from Hokkaido.",
      "Similar photos were posted on Lai's X account, with the message and hashtag written in Japanese.",
      "A video of Lai suggesting to followers that now \"might be a good time to eat Japanese cuisine\" was also shared on his Instagram page.",
      "\"It fully shows the strong friendship between Taiwan and Japan,\" Lai said as he held the plate of sushi.",
      "China's foreign ministry branded Lai's posts a \"stunt.\"",
      "The posts followed media reports in Tokyo on Wednesday that China will suspend Japanese seafood imports. Neither government has confirmed the move.",

    "story": [
      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

      "In a\u00a0post on Truth Social\u00a0late last month, Mr. Trump accused the Nigerian government of not doing enough to prevent the killings of Christians, saying the United States \"may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"",
      "The Nigerian government has vehemently rejected the claims. Tinubu has said the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said on Nov. 1. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "Nigeria's central region has been plagued by violence for years as local herders and farmers often clash over limited access to land and water. The clashes have also taken on a religious dimension, giving rise to militias that side with the primarily Muslim herders or the farmers from Christian communities.",
      "Nigeria's north often sees attacks by the resurgent Boko Haram group, an affiliate of the Islamic State group and armed gangs.",

    "summary": "An airstrike killed 13 people in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh. It was the deadliest Israeli attack reported since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in southern Lebanon Wednesday on what it said were Hezbollah weapons storage facilities after a drone strike earlier in the day killed one person and wounded several others, including students on a bus.",
      "The new strikes came as tensions between Israel and Lebanon are escalating. An airstrike Tuesday night killed 13 people in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh, in southern Lebanon. It was the deadliest Israeli attack reported since a\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago.",
      "Meanwhile, hospitals in Gaza said Israeli strikes killed at least 21 Palestinians.",
      "Israel claims Hezbollah is regrouping",
      "The Israeli military warned Wednesday afternoon it would strike targets in several villages in southern Lebanon, describing them as Hezbollah infrastructure, and called on people to move away from the locations. More than an hour later, the strikes began in the villages of Shehour and Deir Kifa. There was no immediate word on casualties.",
      "Israel's military said Hezbollah was working to reestablish itself and rebuild its capacity in southern Lebanon, without providing evidence. It said the weapons' facilities targeted were embedded among civilians and violated understandings between Israel and Lebanon. Israel agreed to a ceasefire and withdrew from southern Lebanon last year. For its part, Lebanon agreed to quell Hezbollah activity in the area.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike on a car in the southern Lebanese village of Tiri killed one person and wounded 11, including students aboard a nearby bus, the Lebanese Health Ministry and state media said. State-run National News Agency said the school bus happened to be passing near the car that was hit. The bus driver and several students were wounded, the report said.",
      "The Israeli military later said it killed a Hezbollah operative in the drone strike.",
      "In Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp, just outside the port city of Sidon, life appeared normal Wednesday, but Lebanese authorities prevented journalists from entering. At the scene of the strike, paramedics searched for human remains around a wall that was stained with blood. Several cars were burnt and broken glass and debris littered the ground.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas training compound that was being used to prepare an attack against Israel and its army. It added that the Israeli army would continue to act against Hamas wherever it operates.",
      "Hamas condemned the attack and denied in a statement that the sports playground that was hit was its training compound.",
      "The latest Israel-Hezbollah war began Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel, after Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas. The war killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers.",
      "Israeli strikes kill 21 in Gaza",
      "Hospitals in Gaza said at least 21 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes Wednesday on both sides of the yellow line established in last month's ceasefire. The boundary splits the enclave in two, leaving the border zone under Israeli military control while the area beyond it is meant to serve as a safe zone.",
      "Officials at al-Ahli, Shifa, Nasser and Kuwaiti hospitals reported they received the bodies of those killed from Gaza City, Khan Younis and the Muwasi area, the southern Gaza displacement camp. An Israeli strike also killed one person in Shijaiyah, a Gaza City neighborhood outside the safe zone where Israeli forces remain deployed.",
      "The Israeli military said its strikes responded to militants who had opened fire on Israeli forces in Khan Younis earlier in the day. It said no soldiers were killed.",
      "Israeli strikes have decreased since the ceasefire agreement took effect on Oct. 10, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, though they have not stopped entirely. The ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, has reported 280 deaths since the truce began, an average of more than seven per day. Each side has accused the other of violating its terms, which include increasing the flow of aid into Gaza and returning hostages \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 to Israel.",
      "On Monday, the U.N. Security Council approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. The vote was a crucial next step for the fragile ceasefire and efforts to outline Gaza's future after two years of war.",
      "Hamas, however, criticized the U.N.'s adoption of the plan, saying, \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation,\" according to Reuters.",
      "\"Any international force, if established, must be stationed solely on the borders to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and must be entirely under the supervision of the United Nations,\" Hamas said, according to Al Jazeera.",

    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in peace efforts in Sudan at the request of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the U.S. is getting involved in efforts to strike peace in Sudan amid an ongoing civil war there, at the request of his \"very good friend\" Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement Wednesday as he spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, one day after a lengthy meeting with the crown prince, known as MBS, in the Oval Office. The State Department has already said the U.S. has been working with international partners, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, to broker an end to the war, but the president said he views the situation \"differently now than I did just a day ago.\"",
      "The people of Sudan are suffering from a staggering humanitarian crisis, as the two-and-a-half-year war takes its toll. The power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has displaced millions, sparked famine and led to claims of genocide. Mr. Trump said he wasn't planning to get involved in the yearslong conflict in Sudan, but the crown prince suggested he add Sudan to his list of peace deals he has helped broker. The United Nations says what's happening in Sudan is the greatest humanitarian crisis on Earth.",
      "\"His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,\" Mr. Trump told his audience at the U.S.-Saudi business forum. \"It was not on my charts to be involved in that. ... But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan, and we're going to start working on Sudan.\"",
      "The president's announcement was met with great applause in the room. Mr. Trump said his administration got started on working for peace in Sudan about half an hour after his meeting with MBS concluded Tuesday.",
      "\"And you know we've already started working on that, OK?\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, a State Department spokesperson told reporters the Trump administration was engaging directly with the RSF and the Sudanese army, and called on both sides to \"move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce, given the immediate urgency of de-escalating the violence and ending the suffering of the Sudanese people.\"",
      "But the president's push for action draws more focus to the region, while spotlighting MBS' influence. Mr. Trump has emphasized his excellent relationship with MBS, as well as the \"great wealth\" the Saudis are pouring into the U.S.",
      "MBS announced Tuesday in the Oval Office that a planned $600 billion investment in the U.S. from Saudi entities would be closer to $1 trillion. The two leaders also signed what the president called a \"historic\" and \"strategic\" defense agreement, and the U.S. will be selling the Saudis extensive military equipment.",
      "The crown prince's visit has been filled with fanfare, complete with a military jet flyover, cannon fire and an elaborate White House dinner with some of the richest people in the world. But more meaningful to MBS is what Mr. Trump has said on camera about the leader of the country with a troubled human rights record.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's intelligence agencies in 2018 determining the crown prince ordered the killing of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, Mr. Trump claimed in the Oval Office that MBS \"knew nothing about\" it. The president criticized reporters for asking questions about Khashoggi and Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Families of the victims are suing the Saudi government, and a federal judge reviewing thousands of pages of evidence from the attacks concluded the families can move forward with their case.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",

    "summary": "Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll traveled to Ukraine this week on a fact-finding mission regarding military technology as the Trump administration explores restarting peace talks.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday as part of a delegation of senior Pentagon officials on a fact-finding mission to discuss military technology and explore ways to restart peace talks, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "The delegation includes Driscoll, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, the commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa Gen. Chris Donahue, and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.",
      "The White House picked Driscoll to lead the delegation, according to one U.S. official. It opted to send a delegation from the Pentagon in part because the officials will be able to speak from a military perspective, which may be more effective in getting through to the Russians, the official said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the visit.",
      "\"Secretary Driscoll and team arrived this morning in Kyiv on behalf of the administration on a factfinding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,\" Army spokesman Colonel David Butler said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "During the visit, Driscoll will view Ukrainian technology from the Ukrainian military and defense industry, according to a defense official.",
      "Driscoll told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that Ukraine's use of drones and AI technology is an \"incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare.\" He referred to the stunning surprise attack launched in June by Ukraine deep inside Russia \u2014 Operation Spider's Web \u2014 which used what Driscoll called a \"couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones\" to destroy Russian equipment valued at about $10 billion. During Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House last month, he offered drone technology to the U.S.",
      "Over the course of a few days in Ukraine, Driscoll will also spend time with top Ukrainian leaders and is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy to try to restart negotiations.",
      "A Ukrainian official told CBS the focus of the visit would be on the military situation on the ground in addition to plans for a possible ceasefire. The official said Driscoll's visit \"is extremely important, as we are stepping into a decisive phase now.\"",
      "\"Presidents Zelenskyy and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees,\" the Ukrainian official added, noting that Ukraine has also spoken with the group of over 30 countries that support it. \"Ukraine has also held talks with the \"Coalition of the Willing\" on the security guarantees.\" Ukraine has not agreed to permanently cede that territory to Russia.",
      "\"I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the president's agenda of peace in that part of the world,\" Driscoll said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I have not been to the White House, where it has not come up that we just want peace so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere, and we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.\"",
      "Negotiations to end the war have largely stalled since the spring, even after President Trump attempted to revive them in the summer and fall during a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a meeting at the White House with Zelenskyy.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has resumed intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which has used U.K-provided long-range equipment, as well as drones, to conduct attacks on Russia.",
      "A defense official also told CBS News that Driscoll intends to meet with Russian officials in the future, but there are no meetings scheduled yet. A Russian official confirmed to CBS News that Russia is open to any talks and negotiations, and reiterated that in August, Putin had invited Mr. Trump to Moscow.",
      "In an interview with Axios conducted Monday, Putin adviser Kirill Dmitriev said that he and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff had written a 28-point peace plan during a face-to-face visit last month in Miami.",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions himself, and the Treasury Department had to waive them so that he could\u00a0 travel to the U.S. Asked by Brennan on \"Face the Nation\" about those meetings, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed Dmitriev as a \"Russian propagandist.\"",
      "A defense official contacted by CBS News was unable to comment on the 28-point plan described by Dmitriev to Axios, but said that Driscoll intends to open the door to discussing a peace plan. A Russian Embassy official contacted by CBS declined comment on the reported 28-point plan. Dmitriev's spokesperson did not respond in time for publication.",
      "On Tuesday, at a news conference in Spain, Zelenskyy said he intended to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss \"a just peace for Ukraine.\" A State Department official denied reports that Witkoff would be traveling to T\u00fcrkiye for diplomatic meetings with Ukraine.",

      "Navy crew members at a port on the Pacific coast conducted an underwater inspection of the Europe-bound merchant vessel, successfully seizing more than 450 pounds of suspected cocaine, military officials said on social media.",
      "During the underwater inspection, divers from the Buenaventura Coast Guard Station found seven \"suspicious bags\" that were sealed and contained the narcotics, the navy said.",

    "summary": "100 new security cameras and unspecified anti-intrusion systems will be among the \"emergency measures\" implemented at Paris' iconic Louvre Museum.",
    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 The head of the Louvre Museum said Wednesday that new surveillance cameras and anti-intrusion systems will soon be installed at the Paris landmark after last month's stunning crown jewels heist.",
      "The cameras \u2014 some 100 of them \u2014 will be up and running by the end of next year while anti-intrusion systems will start to be put in place within two weeks, Louvre director Laurence des Cars said.",
      "She described the systems as equipment that will prevent intruders from getting close to the museum buildings but did not offer specifics. The new surveillance cameras will try to ensure \"complete protection of the museum's surroundings,\" she said.",
      "\"After the shock, after the emotion, after the assessment, it's time for action\" at the world's most visited museum, des Cars told the Committee of Cultural Affairs of the National Assembly.",
      "She said it was all part of more than 20 \"emergency measures\" that will be implemented. The new measures also include the creation of a \"security coordinator\" position at the museum, and the job has been posted this month, she added.",
      "On the day of the heist, it took thieves less than eight minutes to force their way through a window into the Apollo Gallery with the help of a freight lift and steal the 88 million euros ($102 million) trove.",
      "At least five people have been arrested, but none of the jewels have been recovered. Master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser Stephen Portier told CBS News the thieves would struggle to sell the loot.",
      "\"The whole world knows about this robbery. Dealers will have pictures of every single piece up in their offices,\" he said. \"So if they think they're being offered diamonds from the Louvre ... they will ask some hard questions. And contact the police.\"",
      "Des Cars unveiled some new details about the security breach that allowed the Oct. 19 robbery, saying the power tools used by robbers to cut through the display cases were disc cutters meant for concrete.",
      "\"It's a method that had not been imagined at all\" when the display cases in the Apollo Gallery were replaced in 2019, she said. At the time, they had been designed primarily to counter an attack from inside the museum with weapons, she added.",
      "Footage from museum cameras show that during the robbery, the display cases \"held up remarkably well and did not break apart,\" she said. \"Videos show how difficult it was for the thieves.\"",
      "Des Cars stressed security improvement is a priority of the decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan launched earlier this year, with an estimated cost of up to 800 million euros ($933 million), to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "With the Louvre crumbling under the weight of mass tourism, des Cars has restricted the daily number of visitors to 30,000 in recent years.",
      "The famed glass pyramid inaugurated in 1989 was meant to welcome about 4 millions visitors a year, she recalled. This year, already more than 8 million people visited the Louvre.",
      "\"The extensive modernization that the Louvre underwent in the 1980s is now technically obsolete, with equipment that has been overperforming for 40 years,\" des Cars said.",
      "On Monday, the Louvre announced it was temporarily closing some employee offices and one public gallery because they were structurally fragile.",

      "London \u2014 Britain warned Russia on Wednesday that it was ready to deal with any incursions into its territory after the spy ship Yantar was detected on the edge of U.K. waters north of Scotland.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the Russian vessel had directed lasers at pilots of surveillance aircraft monitoring its activities.",
      "\"This is the first time we've had this action from Yantar directed against the British RAF. We take it extremely seriously,\" Healey said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"My message to Russia and to Putin is this: We see you. We know what you're doing,'' Healey said during a briefing in London. \"And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.\"",
      "\"We have military options ready should the Yantar change course,\" Reuters quoted him as saying.",
      "British officials said the Yantar is part of the Russian navy, designed to conduct surveillance in peacetime and sabotage during times of war. Because of this, the U.K. and its allies track the ship and work to deter its operations whenever it approaches British territorial waters.",
      "\"It is part of a Russian fleet designed to put and hold our undersea infrastructure and those of our allies at risk,\" Healey said, referencing attacks on pipelines and cables under the Baltic Sea earlier this year.",
      "This isn't the first time the Yantar has probed Britain's defenses, Healey said. After a warning last year, the Yantar left U.K. waters for the Mediterranean. When the Russian ship later sailed through the English Channel in January, it was followed by HMS Somerset, a frigate assigned to homeland defense in the waters around Britain.",

    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday ruled out allowing U.S. strikes against cartels on Mexican soil, a day after President Trump said he was willing to do whatever it takes to stop drugs entering the U.S. Meanwhile, Mexican and American diplomats were trying to sort out what may have been an actual U.S. incursion.",
      "On Monday, men arrived in a boat at a beach in northeast Mexico and installed some signs signaling land that the U.S. Department of Defense considered restricted.",
      "Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry said late Monday that the country's navy had removed the signs, which appeared to be on Mexican territory. \"The origin of the signs and their placement on national territory were unclear,\" the ministry said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Sheinbaum said the International Boundary and Water Commission, a binational agency that determines the border between the two countries, was getting involved.",
      "The signs, driven into the sand near where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico, caused a stir when witnesses said men in a boat arrived at the local beach known as Playa Bagdad and erected them.",
      "The signs read in English and Spanish, \"Warning: Restricted Area,\" and went on to explain that it was Department of Defense property and had been declared restricted by \"the commander.\" It said there could be no unauthorized access, photography or drawings of the area.",
      "CBS 4 News Rio Grande Valley posted an image of one of the signs on social media.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Mexico shared a comment from the Pentagon Tuesday about the incident, confirming that contractors putting up signs to mark the \"National Defense Area III\" had placed signs at the mouth of the Rio Grande.",
      "\"Changes in water depth and topography altered the perception of the international boundary's location,\" the statement said. \"Government of Mexico personnel removed 6 signs based on their perception of the international boundary's location.\"",
      "The Pentagon said the contractors would \"coordinate with appropriate agencies to avoid confusion in the future.\"",
      "Mexico had contacted its consulate in Brownsville, Texas, and then the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Eventually, it was determined that contractors working for some U.S. government entity had placed the signs, Sheinbaum said.",
      "\"But the river changes its course, it breaks loose and according to the treaty you have to clearly demarcate the national border,\" Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing Tuesday.",
      "The area is close to SpaceX Starbase, which sits adjacent to Boca Chica Beach on the Texas side of the Rio Grande.",
      "The facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, which hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars.",
      "In June, Sheinbaum said the government was looking into contamination from the SpaceX facility after pieces of metal, plastic and rocket pieces were reportedly found on the Mexican side of the border following the explosion of a rocket during a test.",
      "The area also carries the added sensitivity of Mr. Trump's order to\u00a0rename the Gulf of Mexico\u00a0as the Gulf of America, which Mexico has also rejected.",
      "Meanwhile, Sheinbaum on Tuesday again rejected Mr. Trump's offer of military intervention against cartels.",
      "\"It's not going to happen,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "\"He (Trump) has suggested it on various occasions or he has said, 'we offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico, whatever you need to fight the criminal groups,'\" she said. \"But I have told him on every occasion that we can collaborate, that they can help us with information they have, but that we operate in our territory, that we do not accept any intervention by a foreign government.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said she had said this to Mr. Trump and to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on previous occasions and that they have understood.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Tuesday that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, despite a 2021 intelligence report finding bin Salman ordered the killing.",
      "\"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\" Mr. Trump said about Khashoggi in response to a question from a journalist about his business dealings with bin Salman despite the intelligence report's findings. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it and we can leave it at that.\"",
      "Sitting next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office while\u00a0visiting the White House, bin Salman said, \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose.\" The crown prince also said, \"We did all the right steps in terms of investigation, etc., in Saudi Arabia and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that.\"",
      "\"It's painful and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that will never happen again,\" bin Salman said.",
      "Bin Salman is making his first visit to the White House since Khashoggi's murder. Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview, \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "The 2021 U.S. intelligence report concluded that \"the Crown Prince has had absolute control over the Kingdom's security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince's authorization.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump's comments Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, directed a message on social media to him, writing, \"There is no justification to murder my husband.\"",
      "\"While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press,\" she wrote.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, she said she was \"hurt\" and \"disappointed\" by the Oval Office remarks.",
      "Mr. Trump called bin Salman his friend and praised him as \"incredible on human rights and everything else\" as the Saudi royal made his first visit to the White House since Khashoggi's killing.",
      "Mr. Trump also insisted he has \"nothing to do\" with his family's business dealings with Saudi Arabia, and said, \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "As families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack have pursued a civil lawsuit alleging the kingdom sponsored, aided and supported the al Qaeda hijackers, bin Salman has sought to distance the Saudi government from the attack.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America, but you know, we have to focus on reality,\" bin Salman said Tuesday. \"Reality based on CIA documents and based on a lot of documents that Osama bin Laden used Saudi people in that event for one purpose: To destroy this relation, the American-Saudi relationship.\"",
      "Bin Salman said that \"whoever buys that\" is \"helping Osama bin Laden's purpose of destroying this relation.\" Bin Salman said bin Laden knew the \"strong\" relationship between America and Saudi Arabia is \"bad for extremism.\"",

      "Reacting to the meeting between the two leaders, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi recounted what she said were \"seven years of hell\" in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday. She said that her husband did not deserve to be brutally killed over his criticism of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and that she has not received an apology or seen any actions of accountability from the crown prince.",
      "\"It destroyed my life. It inverted my life,\" Elatr told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout.\"",
      "Elatr came to the U.S. in August 2020 to apply for asylum because she feared for her safety, and was granted it in November 2023,\u00a0according to\u00a0CBS News' partner network BBC News. She had been living in Dubai, where she also grew up, prior to coming to the U.S.",
      "\"I was sharing his mission and vision. I'm the one supporting him in his exile. I was speaking up, putting in my social media, but it fired back at me,\" she said, adding that she was detained many times following his death and placed on house arrest until she decided to come to the U.S.",
      "Upon moving to the U.S., she alleges that she learned authorities in the United Arab Emirates had been surveilling even her prior to her husband's death, in collaboration with Saudi authorities.",

      "Khashoggi's widow \"disappointed\" in Trump response",

The crown prince has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing.",
      "When he was asked about his business dealings with bin Salman, despite that report, Mr. Trump said of Khashoggi, \"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial.\"",
      "The 59-year-old Washington Post columnist was killed after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. In the first two weeks following his disappearance, Saudi officials denied any knowledge. Mr. Trump at the time admitted the nation had been untruthful, but\u00a0resisted blaming MBS for Khashoggi's death.",
      "\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it and we can leave it at that,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",
      "Elatr said she was \"disappointed\" to hear Mr. Trump describing her husband in a way that \"kind of justifies a crime.\"",
      "\"To say he's controversial ... it does not give anyone the right to just kidnap him, torture him, kill him and dismantle his body,\" she told CBS News. \"This hurt me a lot. It's taking away, as well, the freedom for the journalists to do their job. ... And what is the different then between U.S. and any dictatorship in Middle Eastern country?\"",
      "Demanding accountability",
      "While the crown prince has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing, he said in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview that he takes full responsibility as the leader of Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"He admitted verbally, he took responsibility verbally, but he did not take any action to show the world there is rectifying of this crime,\" Elatr said Tuesday. \"... I did not receive an official apology myself as a wife, as they destroyed my life. They've taken my lover.\"",
      "Despite the 2021 intelligence report's findings, Elatr told CBS News that she doesn't know if MBS was directly responsible.",
      "\"I'm not sure 100% the order was given by the crown prince himself because I don't have the tools, I don't have the intelligence. I don't have a country to support me to dig in and to make sure,\" she said.",
      "Sitting next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, bin Salman said, \"It's painful and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that will never happen again.\"",

    "summary": "Documents suggest Epstein had contacts with the Saudi royal family and traveled to the Kingdom in the last years of his life.",
    "story": [
      "In late 2016, Jeffrey Epstein flew his private Gulfstream G550 alone from Paris to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and emerged from the visit with a lavish gift, apparently from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was a tent, \"carpets and all,\" as he later described it. Bedouin tents, in Middle Eastern culture, are a symbol of hospitality.",
      "What Epstein was doing to be honored with that gift is currently a mystery.",
      "This was one of several meetings and interactions Epstein had with world leaders, according to emails and documents released in recent weeks that detail his activities in the final years of his life. They also included meetings with other members of the Saudi royal family.",
      "Bin Salman is visiting Washington this week and meeting with President Trump. It's a major moment for the Kingdom as it seeks to enhance its global image in the wake of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. So far, Epstein's business dealings with the Kingdom and members of the royal family have largely avoided close scrutiny.",
      "Much of that information comes from the release of hundreds of text messages, emails and other documents sent to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate as part of the committee's investigation. Revelations about the tent and carpets were included in emails between Epstein and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.",
      "Epstein's planning for his 2016 trip included an email from his assistant saying, \"Did you need me to book the Four Seasons for you in Riyadh? Or is the king taking care of it!?\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Saudi officials in D.C. for comment and has not had a response by time of publication.",
      "There is no evidence that anyone involved in the Saudi government had involvement with anything related to Epstein's sex trafficking allegations.",
      "Why Epstein's estate has chosen to release certain documents is not clear. The release is in response to a subpoena that included requests for documents relating to his finances, as well as potential victims. What has been released is likely a fraction of what the estate possesses of Epstein's communications, and it's not clear if there will be future releases that could provide additional details. Epstein maintained extensive communication with his staff, financial clients and friends over the years.",
      "As Congress voted almost unanimously on Tuesday to demand the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, most of the public's focus has been on his sex crimes \u2014 but any release of additional documents could reveal more about Epstein's vast global business connections, which have so far remained mostly unknown.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, told CBS News there are a host of unanswered questions stemming from Epstein's financial dealings all around the globe.",
      "\"My own investigation has found that Epstein was moving hundreds of millions of dollars around the world during the years he operated his cross-border sex trafficking operation, but it's still not clear who among his foreign network knew about his trafficking, enabled it, and participated in it,\" Wyden said.",
      "Epstein, who fashioned himself as an elite money manager, was also advising the governments of Mongolia and the Maldives, as well as traveling and presumably making or seeking business deals in the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the Ivory Coast, China, Russia, Qatar and Belarus, according to those documents. But Epstein's contacts with Saudi Arabia appear to have been some of his most extensive and potentially lucrative dealings with foreign leaders.",
      "Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman consolidated his control in Saudi Arabia in 2017 following a purge of high level government officials. A few days later, New York Times reporter Thomas Landon Jr. emailed Epstein, \"Did your Saudi friends survive the purge?\" Epstein responded, \"All. With gods help ;).\"",
      "Epstein discussed another brush with the Saudi crown prince in April 2018. It comes up in a text message exchange with an individual whose name is redacted in the documents, but who appears from the context of their chat to be former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Epstein writes, \"MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] has the Louvre and 400 guards. To himself,\" and he indicates that he is on his way over.",
      "\"No better way to spend s(sic) Sunday,\" came the reply.",
      "That evening, French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a photo of himself and bin Salman at the Louvre with the caption, \"With Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\" CBS News has reached out to the government of France to find out if Epstein was present, but has not received a response.",
      "That document ended with a text the following day from Epstein to Bannon: \"If you are around the 18th, in dc. John Kerry,\" the former senator, presidential candidate and secretary of state.",
      "A spokesperson for Kerry told CBS News that he was back home in Boston after the end of his service in the Obama administration. \"He wasn't in Washington, DC, was never scheduled to be in Washington, and did not have a meeting or meeting request from that cast of characters, period, which isn't surprising since he didn't have a relationship with either one of them, and wasn't in contact with either of them,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "According to other messages sent from Epstein, he was planning another visit for the summer of 2019 to Saudi Arabia. That trip never happened due to his arrest and incarceration on federal sex crime charges.",
      "Other signs of the connections between Epstein and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have surfaced since his death. Authorities found a photograph of Epstein posing with bin Salman prominently displayed in his Manhattan mansion, according to The New York Times.",
      "After Epstein's arrest in 2019, officials also discovered that he held an expired Austrian passport from the 1980s with his picture and a false name, which listed his residence as Saudi Arabia.",

We let our guard down when we're rushed, distracted or excited by a deal. Staying alert during the holiday season can help you avoid data exposure and financial losses. Here are some of the most common scams you should be aware of.",
      "The surge of promotions during the holiday season is the perfect time for \"phantom stores\" to thrive. It's a fraudulent store that mimics the interface and products of a well-known brand. Once you purchase from such a website, you'll never receive your order as the store doesn't actually exist.",
      "Real-world example: Fake IKEA websites appeared with URLs spelled \"ikeaa-sale.com\" and \"ikea-blackfriday.shop,\" mimicking the official ikea.com interface with copied product images, logos and discount banners.",

They can easily find your contact information and order details to text \"Your order couldn't be delivered.\" Each text contains a phishing link that can install malware on your device or steal your personal information. That's why Temu warns its users about the couriers they partner with.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Make sure the texts you receive come from a legit courier service and double-check it on the store's website.",
      "Some scammers use sophisticated phishing tactics to lure victims. They engineer emails from well-known brands, use an urgent tone, place malicious links and urge you to click on your order status. In reality, there is no order status \u2013 they're stealing your data.",
      "Real-world example: Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers worldwide, and that makes the brand easy to mimic. Scammers send emails on behalf of Amazon to try to steal customers' personal data because it's highly likely that their victims have used Amazon, making it less suspicious. However, phishing emails have some telltale signs you can look out for.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Never click on any suspicious links and always check the sender's contact information.",
      "When you shop online, you should be aware of the data you share, including your contact information, shopping habits, credit card details and more. All stores collect some type of data about you. However, some companies collect more than you think.",
      "Real-world example: The infamous Target controversy in 2012 revealed how big retailers use data analysis to predict your shopping behavior. The company collected shopping data and managed to produce a predictive model for soon-to-be mothers.",
      "They sent out brochures with baby clothes, vouchers for baby formula and more before the customers even knew they were pregnant. Thankfully, modern shopping looks a bit different.

      "How scammers find you",
      "Imagine you're browsing for gifts online. Within minutes, your activity generates data points \u2013 device info, IP address, browsing habits that feed into online databases. At the same time, data brokers already have your full profile: age, income, address history, family members and even shopping behavior. These profiles are sold to marketers and often leak into criminal databases.",
      "That's why scam calls, texts and emails often feel so \"real.\" They use your name, the right retailer, even your city. They're not guessing. They've bought your digital footprint.",

      "Most people clear their browser cookies or delete old emails to \"stay private.\" But that's like locking your front door while leaving all your personal documents on the lawn.",
      "If you want to stop scammers from targeting you this holiday season, you need to remove your personal data from the source, the data broker databases that feed these scams.",
      "That's where a data removal service comes in. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company\u2019s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.",
      "Multiple agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and War, supported that proposal. They believe the company\u2019s connections could expose American networks to foreign influence.",
      "Security experts warn that foreign-backed hackers have targeted home and office routers for years. These devices often act as silent steppingstones that help attackers move deeper into sensitive systems. When compromised, they can expose everything connected to them, including computers, smart home gear, military devices used on base and more.",
      "This potential ban would be one of the biggest consumer tech actions in U.S. history. It comes as lawmakers raise fresh alarms about Chinese-made cameras, routers and connected home products sold on military exchanges and in homes across the country.",

      "Why military families are even more vulnerable",
      "Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.",
      "Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.",
      "We reached out to TP-Link Systems Inc., and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"TP-Link Systems Inc. (TP-Link), an American company based in California, refutes the claims in this letter. This letter repeats false and misleading media reports and attacks that have been thoroughly debunked.\"",
      "\"TP-Link emphatically objects to any allegation it is tied to the Communist Party of China, dependent on the Chinese government, or otherwise subject to interference under Chinese national security laws,\" the TP-Link spokesperson said. \"The company is not controlled by any government, foreign or domestic. TP-Link has split from and has no affiliation with the China-based TP-LINK Technologies Co. Ltd., which is separately owned and operated.",
      "Lawmakers warn that TP-Link devices sold on military bases may put service members and their families at greater risk, especially inside base housing. (John Moore/Getty Images)",
      "\"This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems\u2019 products from the marketplace. The \u2018open source information\u2019 the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year. Instead of directly engaging with TP-Link Systems, these members essentially pressed \u2018copy and paste\u2019 on unsubstantiated claims about our American company.",
      "\"TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States. U.S. user data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services infrastructure in Virginia, under the full control of the company\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "\"TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell\u2019Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.",
      "\"TP-Link does not enable foreign surveillance of U.S. networks or users. The company\u2019s operations are built to prevent potential attempts to subvert its business by outside influence. TP-Link\u2019s substantial security investments cover its entire product portfolio, including security cameras and routers.",
      "\"TP-Link continually monitors its products and services and takes timely and appropriate action to address vulnerabilities it becomes aware of. TP-Link has not identified any reliable information regarding new vulnerabilities in its products in connection with this letter.\"",

      "According to the statement provided to CyberGuy, the breach was limited to employment-related information tied to Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. The company confirmed that about 2,000 current and former employees were notified of the incident in late October.

      "Why this Hyundai AutoEver America breach matters",
      "The exposed data reportedly includes names, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, making this breach far more serious than one involving passwords alone. Experts warn that these details can be used for long-term identity theft and financial fraud. Because Social Security numbers cannot easily be changed, criminals have more time to create fake identities, open fraudulent accounts and launch targeted phishing attacks long after the initial breach.",

      "According to the company, this incident was limited to employment-related data and primarily affected approximately 2,000 current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. No customer information or Bluelink driver details were exposed. While some filings reference sensitive data types such as Social Security numbers or driver's license information, the incident did not involve Hyundai customers or the millions of connected vehicles HAEA supports.",
      "Earlier reports suggested that 2.7 million individuals were affected, but Hyundai says that figure is unrelated to the breach. Instead, 2.7 million is the estimated number of connected vehicles that Hyundai AutoEver America helps support across North America. None of that consumer or vehicle data was accessed.",

      "Hyundai also clarified that the United States has about 850 Hyundai dealerships and emphasized that the scope of this incident was narrow and contained.",

      "\"Hyundai AutoEver America, an IT vendor that manages certain Hyundai Motor America employee data systems, experienced an incident to that area of business that impacted employment-related data and primarily affected current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. Approximately 2,000 primarily current and former employees were notified of the incident. The 2.7 million figure that is cited in many media articles has no relation to the actual security incident.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Skagit County Superior Court judge ruled that images from Flock Safety automated license plate reader cameras in Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley qualify as public records under Washington's Public Records Act.",
      "Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski said the images are \"not exempt from disclosure\" and explained that an agency does not need to physically hold a record for it to fall under the law.",
      "The request that led to the ruling",
      "The case began when Washington resident Jose Rodriguez asked Stanwood for one hour of Flock camera images. That request prompted Stanwood and neighboring Sedro-Woolley to ask the court to declare that vendor-stored data did not count as public records.",

      "Judge Neidzwski rejected that argument. She said the cities' ALPR images support a government purpose and meet the definition of a public record.",

      "Flock Safety cameras use AI to capture license plate images in real time, tracking vehicles as they move through neighborhoods. (Flock Safety)",
      "However, Rodriguez will not receive the specific images he sought. The city had already allowed the footage to auto-delete after 30 days, and it expired before the ruling.",
      "We reached out to Flock Safety, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"The Court merely declined to exempt these records from disclosure under Washington's extremely broad public records law. Nothing changed in the status quo in Washington as a result of this ruling \u2014 these records were covered by the law before the ruling, and remain so following the ruling. Unfortunately, some individuals in Washington have abused the breadth of the public records law to extort significant settlements from Washington communities for technical violations of the disclosure requirements, which we cannot believe is the intent of the law. We are supporting efforts to enact a legislative fix to this situation, which is costing Washington communities tens of thousands of dollars to stave off frivolous lawsuits.\"",
      "The Washington court ruling marks a major step toward transparency in how police collect and store surveillance data. (Flock Safety)",
      "Why the decision matters for transparency",
      "Flock's automated license plate reader cameras capture multiple still images of passing vehicles along with time, location and license plate information. Cities use the system to assist law enforcement with investigations, relying on stored images to identify vehicles connected to crimes or alerts.",
      "The court's ruling raises broader questions about how local agencies manage these images once they're created. By finding that the images qualify as public records, the decision forces cities to examine how long they retain this data, how it is stored and who may request access under state law.",
      "Privacy advocates say the ruling highlights the need for clear policies around retention and transparency, while law enforcement groups argue that access rules must still protect ongoing investigations.",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "The debate continues as communities weigh the balance between public safety, privacy and the right to know what\u2019s being recorded. (Flock Safety)",
      "How this ruling impacts privacy and surveillance",
      "For years, cities and police agencies have argued that data stored by third-party vendors falls outside public records laws. They often make this claim even when the data documents activity on public roads. The Washington ruling did not settle broader questions about surveillance, but it rejected the idea that Flock camera images are exempt simply because a vendor stores them. This decision exposes a growing tension between how agencies use surveillance tools and what the public can access under state law.",
      "Beryl Lipton of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to defending digital privacy, free expression and transparency in technology, told Cyberguy,\u00a0\"The use of third-party vendors for surveillance and data storage is widespread and growing across the country, and allowing this to undermine the public\u2019s right to know is very dangerous. The government's primary obligation should be to its constituents, which includes protecting their rights under public records laws, not to the private vendors that they choose to employ while conducting mass surveillance. Whether an agency stores images and information on their own devices or on the private server of a vendor should not affect the appropriate disclosure of these records under public records laws. If the use of these devices makes it too difficult for a city to comply with the law, then the response should not be to circumvent the laws they find inconvenient, but rather it should be to only use vendors that won\u2019t get in the way of a city\u2019s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to their citizenry. Otherwise, they should not use these tools at all.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "If your town uses Flock or other automated license plate readers, this ruling shows how Washington courts may handle future records requests. It confirms that ALPR images can count as public records, even when a vendor stores the data.",
      "The debate over privacy and safety continues. Supporters say public access builds trust and oversight. Critics worry that releasing vehicle data could expose sensitive details without strong safeguards or redactions.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This ruling shows how courts may handle data from automated license plate readers. It also reveals how much vehicle information cities collect. As a result, it raises new questions about who should access these records. In addition, the decision may guide future transparency debates in Washington.

      "But instead of activating anything, the PowerShell command connects to a remote domain named slmgr[.]win, which downloads harmful executables from Cloudflare-hosted pages.

      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",
      "SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS",
      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Gaia Family is blending AI and empathy to rewrite how fertility care works. It replaces uncertainty with insight and transforms risk into reassurance. For many, it's not just about technology, it's about restoring hope and fairness to one of life's most personal journeys.",

These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.",
      "CHINESE AUTO GIANT WANTS TO MAKE FLYING CARS YOUR NEXT COMMUTE OPTION",
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s Jetsons Act aims to prepare the state for the future of flying cars before they take off. (CycloTech)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",
      "The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Sen. Flynn's Jetsons Act might sound futuristic, but it reflects a growing reality in transportation. As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid. Lawmakers are thinking ahead about licensing, safety and how to integrate flying cars into existing traffic systems. That forward-thinking approach could one day make Pennsylvania one of the first states to see cars take to the sky.",

      "BEWARE OF FAKE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT RESTRICTION SCAMS",
      "This fake Geek Squad invoice looks professional, but small red flags, like a generic greeting, expose the scam. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the scam works",
      "The scam depends on fear and confusion. Once you call the number, the person on the line sounds polite and professional. They might say they need to verify your payment or reverse a charge. In reality, they are trying to get your credit card number or convince you to install software that gives them access to your computer.",

      "Why these scam emails look so real",
      "Scammers have refined their tactics. In this Geek Squad scam email I received, they copied the official logo, used clean layouts and included my actual email address to make it look legitimate. They often get this information from\u00a0data leaks or\u00a0security breaches found online.",

      "How to stay safe from scam emails",
      "Scam emails like the fake Geek Squad invoice are becoming more common and more convincing. They use fear and urgency to make you click or call before you think. Protecting yourself means slowing down, verifying every detail and strengthening your digital defenses. Here is how you can stay safe.",
      "The phone number or link in the message connects you directly to scammers, so don't click or call.\u00a0 Once you engage, they can pressure you into sharing personal details or even install harmful software on your device. The moment I saw that \"Payment order settled\" email, I realized something was off because I don't even have a Geek Squad account. That alone was a major red flag. If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software. Antivirus software acts as your digital guard. It scans downloads, detects malicious links and warns you before dangerous sites load. Choose a trusted program that updates automatically and includes email protection features. This extra layer of defense can prevent malware from taking hold if you accidentally click something suspicious.",

      "Scammers often use email addresses that look real but have slight differences, such as extra numbers, misspelled words, or unusual domains. A genuine Geek Squad or Best Buy email will come from @bestbuy.com. Always hover over the sender's name to see the actual address before responding.",
      "If someone contacts you claiming to be from Geek Squad or Best Buy, stay calm and skeptical. Real companies do not ask for banking details, gift card payments, or remote access to your computer over the phone. Hang up and contact the company directly through its verified website or customer service number.",

Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for criminals to target you with fake invoices or phishing emails.",

It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Old software is one of the easiest ways for hackers to slip in. Keep your operating system, browser and security programs updated. Turn on automatic updates so you do not have to think about it. These patches often close known security holes that scammers exploit.",
      "Before reacting to any invoice or payment alert, go straight to the official account or service mentioned, such as Geek Squad, PayPal, Amazon or your bank. Log in directly through their website or app to verify the details. If nothing shows up there, the email is a scam. This quick step can save you from a costly mistake.",
      "Reporting suspicious emails helps stop scammers from targeting others. Most email services, including Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo, allow you to mark messages as phishing.

      "All about the Conduent breach and its scale",
      "Conduent discovered the intrusion in January 2025 and said hackers had infiltrated its network as early as Oct. 21, 2024. During this period, attackers reportedly stole large amounts of data linked to state-level programs such as Medicaid, child support, food assistance and toll systems. Conduent claims that its investigation found no ongoing malicious activity and said operations were safely restored after the breach was contained.",
      "Conduent manages technology and payment systems for dozens of U.S. state governments, processing roughly $85 billion in annual disbursements and handling over 2 billion customer service interactions every year.

      "In January, Conduent described the event as an \"operational disruption caused by a third-party compromise.\" The breach led to several days of downtime, disrupting vital services in multiple states. In Wisconsin, for instance, parents and beneficiaries were unable to process payments due to system outages, leaving many struggling to meet obligations related to child support and welfare programs.",
      "The SafePay ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it had stolen 8.5 terabytes of data. Conduent confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that hackers had indeed exfiltrated files belonging to a limited number of clients. The company says it hired cybersecurity experts to analyze the stolen data and recently confirmed that it contained significant amounts of personal information from end-users across multiple programs.",
      "Despite the massive theft, Conduent said there is currently no evidence that the stolen data has been published online or on dark web marketplaces.",

      "\"Upon discovery of the incident, Conduent acted quickly to secure its networks, restore its systems and operations, notify law enforcement and conduct an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensics experts. In addition, given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Conduent has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein, which was a time-intensive process.

Data exfiltration on this scale has long-term implications, from identity theft to potential fraud within public benefit systems. The real test will be how both Conduent and its government partners adapt their cybersecurity oversight to prevent similar breaches. Because at this point, the question isn't whether these systems will be targeted again, but whether they'll be any better prepared when it happens.",

The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.",
      "Why flat solar panels are no longer enough",
      "Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.",
      "Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.",
      "Janta Power\u2019s 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. (Janta Power)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How Janta's solar towers work",
      "Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.",

      "Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.",
      "Stronger, smarter and more efficient",
      "Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.",
      "Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.",
      "A game-changer for energy economics",
      "The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.",
      "That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.",
      "Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta\u2019s modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and across Aena\u2019s global network. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "CHINESE-MADE SOLAR PANELS USED ON AMERICAN FARMS PUTS US POWER GRID AT RISK: FORMER NSA OFFICIAL",
      "What this means for you",
      "For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.",
      "For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.",

      "Coordinated counterterrorism raids across Europe have uncovered what Israeli authorities describe as a significant Hamas network preparing attacks against Israeli and Jewish civilians. The joint effort involved the Mossad and multiple European intelligence and law enforcement agencies working across several countries.",
      "According to the statement released by Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Office on behalf of the Mossad for Intelligence and Special Operations, the dismantled network was part of a broader effort by Hamas leadership to establish terror infrastructure across the continent. Israeli officials refer to the network as the \"Hamas Octopus,\" describing operational cells, weapons hideouts and logistical channels intended to activate attacks \"on command.\"",
      "A senior Israeli intelligence official familiar with the details told Fox News Digital, \"There are active cells across Europe right now, already on their way to targets, and the public \u2014 along with law-enforcement bodies in these countries \u2014 must be significantly more alert as this activity continues.\"",

(Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office)",
      "One of the pivotal discoveries was made in Vienna this past September, when Austria\u2019s security and intelligence service (DSN) located a weapons hideout containing pistols and explosive materials. Israeli authorities say the cache belonged to Hamas operative Muhammad Naim, the son of senior Hamas political bureau member in Gaza, Bassem Naim, who is described as close to Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya.",
      "As European agencies coordinated their investigation, Israeli officials uncovered information linking the Vienna activity to developments outside Europe. Israel says a meeting took place in Qatar in September between Muhammad Naim and his father. The timing, according to Israel, suggests possible involvement by Hamas leadership abroad in advancing the network\u2019s activities despite repeated public denials by senior movement figures. Israeli officials add that such denials may indicate a loss of control over \"rogue operatives.\"",

In November, German authorities arrested a prominent figure in the network, Burhan al-Khatib, after a stay in Turkey, \"likely after completing his operational activity on European soil,\" according to Israel.",
      "The senior Israeli intelligence official said that Turkey \u2014 despite its friendship with the White House and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s close ties with Washington \u2014 shows \"unmistakable signs of involvement. This includes the arrest in Germany of a Hamas operative who arrived directly from Turkey. Some of the direction and operational guidance is being carried out from inside Turkey, and Turkey\u2019s hosting of Hamas is directly fueling terror activity in Europe.\"",

Daniels, ruling against Saudi Arabia's efforts to dismiss a lawsuit brought against it by the families of 9/11 victims, which alleged the country was party to the attacks.",

Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more.\"",
      "A senior administration official, speaking on background, told Fox News Digital that the expected agreements will include a multibillion-dollar investment in America\u2019s AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and defense sales aimed at strengthening defense cooperation between the two countries.",
      "The official added that the visit will also focus on the fulfillment of the Saudis\u2019 $600 billion investment pledge through dozens of targeted investments across key U.S. sectors.",
      "In Saudi Arabia, the visit is being seen as historic. Aziz Alghashian, a lecturer in international relations at Naif Arab University in Riyadh, said there is \"a lot of excitement. The Saudis have said they\u2019re not isolated in the region\u2026 this is back through open doors and the front door again.\" He said the moment reflects a broader shift in how Saudis understand their country\u2019s place in the world. According to Alghashian, Trump\u2019s repeatedly warm comments about the crown prince and the kingdom also contribute to a sense that Riyadh is re-entering Washington on strong footing.",
      "The visit by MBS will be his first White House appearance since the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence assessed he approved, a charge he denies.",

      "At the heart of the visit is the emerging U.S.-Saudi security pact. Alghashian described its purpose in three words: \"elevate, facilitate and consolidate.\"",
      "In his view, the agreement is meant \"to elevate the Saudi-American relationship,\" transforming it from what he called a \"strategic partnership\" into a more formalized security alignment. Although not a full treaty, which Riyadh had previously pursued, the pact would still represent the most significant upgrade to the relationship in decades. He said the shift also has a domestic political rationale in Washington, arguing that being included in an \"alliance\" category \"helps make Saudi Arabia become more of a bipartisan issue, and not just necessarily a Trump legacy.\"",

      "That urgency extends to nuclear cooperation, where Saudi Arabia has made clear that while China and South Korea exist as alternatives, its preference is for an American program. \"Saudi Arabia really wants American nuclear cooperation because it adds more security,\" he said, adding that Riyadh will not \"wait forever\" if conditions become overly restrictive but sees the current U.S. posture as an opening.",

He recalled hearing a senior Saudi official say recently that \"there will be no regional integration without Palestinian statehood,\" a line that reflects the kingdom\u2019s long-standing public position that recognition of Israel will only come after a credible pathway to a Palestinian state is in place.",
      "Still, Olidort said full Saudi-Israel normalization may not be necessary at this moment for U.S. priorities to advance. He said normalization \"doesn\u2019t need to be the immediate priority\" and suggested that \"an upgraded deepening of cooperation, but short of full normalization,\" could be possible if both sides see value in closer security integration.",
      "TRUMP SECURES DEALS WITH 3 MIDDLE EASTERN NATIONS IN 1ST MAJOR TRIP OF 2ND TERM",
      "That perspective is particularly relevant given the war in Gaza and Riyadh\u2019s position on reconstruction.

      "Trump\u2019s decision to approve F-35 sales to Saudi Arabia adds another layer. Saudi Arabia has formally requested up to 48 of the fifth-generation jets, making it the largest potential F-35 buyer outside NATO and the first Arab state after the United Arab Emirates to receive them. The move would test Washington\u2019s commitment to maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge.",
      "Olidort, however, argued that the sale does not automatically threaten Israel\u2019s superiority. \"I don\u2019t know that it will mean Israel losing air superiority,\" he said, noting that Israel\u2019s defense and aerospace sectors are \"world-class\" and that the sale could \"potentially deepen collaboration between Israel and Saudi Arabia and make each of our partners\u2026 more effective.\"",

      "Over the weekend, former Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said that she was facing increased levels of threats after the president posted unfavorably about her on Truth Social.

      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is now facing the president\u2019s wrath, but in a sign of broader fissures within the MAGA movement, she just may survive the blowback, interviews with about 20 of her constituents suggest.",
      "Once an unflinching Trump loyalist, Greene now faults him for spending too much time on meet-and-greets with foreign leaders when many people at home are struggling to pay bills.",
      "\u201cPeople in my district are having a very hard time,\u201d she told NBC News in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that many voters are feeling a little disenfranchised because the domestic issues have not been the priority,\u201d she added.",
      "Trump, in turn, is angry about her apostasy. He pulled his support for her and has signaled that he\u2019d be open to endorsing a Republican challenger to her in the 2026 midterm congressional elections.",
      "He\u2019s called her a \u201ctraitor\u201d and said she is \u201cwacky,\u201d a \u201clunatic.\u201d",
      "Greene has bristled over what she calls his \u201cvicious attacks\u201d and worried that they are \u201ca dog whistle to dangerous radicals that could lead to serious attacks on me and my family.\u201d",
      "All of which leaves voters in northwest Georgia feeling a bit like a heartsick family swept up in an unexpected divorce.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not right,\u201d Debbie Dyer, 60, said of Trump\u2019s accusation. \u201cShe should not be seen as a traitor. She\u2019s trying to do the best for the American people and I think Donald Trump should accommodate her and work for America.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe has a lot of courage and tells it like it is,\u201d added Dyer, who lives in Dalton, near the Tennessee border, and works at a carpet company.",
      "Greene's office did not return a request for comment for this article.",
      "Greene\u2019s 14th Congressional District likes Trump, but it likes her, too. Greene often eats at the Blossom Hill restaurant, with her \u201cgo-to\u201d sandwich being the \u201cAngry Pig\u201d (pulled pork, jalape\u00f1os and fried onions served with a choice of sides).",
      "Trump won her district in the 2024 presidential race with 68% of the vote; Greene won re-election with 64%. Virtually everyone interviewed has heard about the feud between the president and the congresswoman. Who goes with mom; who stays with dad?",
      "\u201cSome people are struggling with it. Some are choosing Team Marjorie, and some are Team Trump,\u201d said Angela Dollar, a local Republican official in Floyd County, part of Greene\u2019s district."

      "This article was published in partnership with Bloomberg Law.",
      "Dozens of pregnant women who are jailed, often for petty crimes, are miscarrying or giving birth in excruciating pain into cell toilets and on filthy jail floors. Their babies are suffering infections and long-lasting health issues. Some die.",
      "Bloomberg Law and NBC News analyzed federal lawsuits and found at least 54 pregnant women or their families alleged severe mistreatment or medical neglect in county jails from 2017 to 2024. The catastrophes they describe signal a much larger problem, since filing a federal lawsuit is difficult, experts said.",
      "Most of the women in these cases were arrested on nonviolent charges that included probation violations, theft and drug possession. They were housed in jails, largely intended for short-term detention as criminal cases unfold, not prisons, which are for punishment after convictions.",
      "Here is a look at their cases:",
      "There\u2019s no way to be certain whether the pregnancy complications the women experienced occurred because of their time behind bars. About 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. Stillbirths occur in about 1 out of 175 births.",
      "But unsanitary conditions and limited access to prenatal care, medical providers and critical medication are factors that can affect a healthy birth or contribute to preterm labor.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Methodology:",
      "The 54 cases in this article are drawn from more than 200,000 civil rights and prisoner-related complaints filed in federal district court from Jan. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2024. Reporters identified relevant cases by searching nine civil nature of suit codes declared by the plaintiffs, as well as keyword searching the text of complaints to identify terms such as \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201cmother\u201d and \u201cjail.\u201d Pro se cases, in which people choose to represent themselves rather than hire attorneys, were largely excluded. The team also used Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 to summarize complaints and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o to answer questions including \u201cDoes this case involve harm to a pregnant person?\u201d Reporters reviewed each of the potential cases and included them if they met the following criteria: The pregnant woman was housed in a facility that primarily incarcerates pretrial detainees and there were allegations of harm to the woman or her pregnancy while she was under the care of that facility."

      "Hoover is the author of the 2016 book that was the basis for the 2024 film of the same name. The movie has been tainted with controversy since late last year, when Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, in which she accuses him of sexual harassment on the set, as well as creating a smear campaign against her. Baldoni\u2019s $400 million countersuit against Lively and a defamation suit he filed against The New York Times was dismissed in June.",
      "The legal issues have cast a shadow over the movie, while Hoover told Elle magazine in a Nov. 20 article that the matter is \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",

I have my own story I could tell \u2026 but I don\u2019t want to bring attention to it, and I don\u2019t want to have to put someone else down to lift myself up. So I\u2019d rather just ignore it and let people think and say what they\u2019re going to say,\u201d she said.",

      "The basis of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was drawn from Hoover\u2019s mother\u2019s own experience. The author says the controversy takes away from what she has had to endure.",
      "\u201cThe book was inspired by her story, and now it gives us PTSD to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel awful because I almost feel like she\u2019s gone through more with the aftermath of this film, more pain than she went through with my dad, just seeing the ugliness of it.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe more time that passes, the easier everything gets for all of us,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it is sad, because I was very proud of that book. And I\u2019m still proud of it, but less publicly so. Maybe I need therapy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d"

    "summary": "Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen talk about playing on-screen love interests and the creator Mike Schur teases more Season 2 twists.",
    "story": [
      "How do you solve the case of a college president being blackmailed if every member of the faculty is a suspect? You need a man on the inside. It also helps if that man is a former professor-turned private investigator.",
      "Created by Mike Shur and based the 2020 Chilean documentary \u201cThe Mole Agent,\u201d the Netflix comedic mystery \"Man on the Inside\" follows Charles Nieuwendyk (Ted Danson), an engineering professor who turns to solving mysteries.",
      "In Season 2, out Nov. 20, he investigates a cryptic blackmailer who is threatening Jack Berenger (Max Greenfield), the president of Wheeler College, and the proposed $400 million donation made by billionaire alumni Brad Vinick (Gary Cole).",
      "To complicate matters even further, the detective starts falling for one of his suspects, a vibrant music teacher named Mona (Mary Steenburgen).",
      "After Charles solved the case of a missing ruby necklace at Pacific View Retirement Community in Season 1, he finds himself in an investigative rut. Catching a man having an affair might be interesting the first time around, but after the ninth, Charles is ready to never encounter a cheating man again. That\u2019s why, when he hears about Berenger\u2019s case, he jumps at the chance to go undercover.",
      "As soon as Charles steps foot on the campus of Wheeler College, he assembles a long list of possible suspects, all of whom have a reason to detest the billionaire graduate who is known for flying his dog on a private jet every day from San Francisco to Aspen.",
      "While Charles is busy gathering evidence, his boss Julie (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) must seek help from a precarious source \u2014 who just also happens to be her estranged mother, Vanessa (Constance Marie).",
      "One theme that Shur wanted to examine in \u201cA Man on the Inside\u201d was the need for connection and how the dynamic relationship between adult children and their aging parents evolve over time.",
      "In Season 1, Charles grew distant from his daughter Emily (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) following the death of his wife.",
      "\u201cThey loved each other and were close, but drifted apart because of a tragedy that happened,\u201d Shur tells TODAY.com. Over the course of the first season, Charles learned how to communicate his shared grief with Emily.",
      "That same theme of familial reconciliation can be seen with Julie and her mother. Because Julie never discussed her personal life with Charles, Shur described how this new season was a chance for viewers to get to know Julie and her past.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason this woman is a private investigator,\u201d Shur says. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that she\u2019s so guarded and mistrustful of people \u2014 almost borderline paranoid. We thought, \u2018What if the story is her mom was a con artist and was arrested when she was a kid?\u2019 That explains a lot about that character. But then what if that woman is still in her life in a very tangential way? It was a wonderful story to tell about making amends with a parent.\u201d",
      "While Season 1 explored Charles\u2019 loneliness and heartache after his late wife\u2019s death, Season 2 adds a romantic twist for Charles. Who better to play a love interest opposite Danson than Steenburgen, his actual wife of 30 years?",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Danson shared how his character changed because of his newfound relationship with Mona.",
      "\u201cThe fact that you are willing to take a chance at something so vulnerable as opening your heart back up to another person takes courage,\u201d Danson says. \u201cA lot of times, people would rather not risk loss again. They play safe and rock back on their heels. It was exciting for me to play something that I believe is worth putting out in the world, which is to stay curious and go for it because life\u2019s not over.\u201d",
      "Steenburgen and Danson have been married for 30 years, but their characters only came together in their 70s. In one scene, Mona talks about how, at their age, both she and Charles have experienced terrific highs and terrible lows, but she\u2019s learned to not get stuck in the past or worry about the future. Instead, her goal is to capture the joy of the present.",
      "\"Now is a time where I\u2019ve gotten to grow as a person.\u201d",
      "Mary steenburgen",
      "Steenburgen tells TODAY.com how age has helped her find those moments of bliss her character described.",
      "\u201cPart of it is that so much of my younger life was about other people,\u201d Steenburgen says. \u201cI was nurturing children. I was taking care of my parents. But now is a time where I\u2019ve gotten to grow as a person.\u201d",
      "Referencing Dylan Thomas\u2019 poem, \u201cDo not go gentle into that good night,\u201d Steenburgen adds that age isn\u2019t a time to \u201cslow down but live faster and harder.\"",
      "And if you can do it with someone you adore, like she\u2019s fortunate enough to, how can you not feel that joy?"

      "\u201cThe honest truth was I was just more taken aback by the power of the band and the music and the sound,\u201d he said, before touching on his early relationship with Selena. \u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t hang out too much. Selena was always either off with Suzette or her mom.\u201d",
      "He credited the long tour bus trips to them becoming friends.",
      "\u201cAnytime we were next to each other, it would just be me and her talking about music and movies and things like that,\u201d he said, admiring how it was \u201ccool seeing her being a normal person.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut what we had going with each other, I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that at all,\u201d he said.",
      "P\u00e9rez also reads a letter Selena wrote to him before they got married and recalls the moment her dad got upset with him when he found out about their relationship.",
      "Selena\u2019s widow also touches on the day he found out she died.",
      "\u201cI do miss her a lot. But today, I\u2019m very proud of what she represents and the small part that I might play in that story,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "It wasn't until her junior year of college that Nia Sioux realized she was ready.",
      "Then a student at UCLA, she was in Los Angeles with her mom, Holly Frazier. She remembers looking at her and saying, \"I'm ready to write it.\"",
      "She was referring to her long-planned dream of writing a memoir about her time on the Lifetime reality show \"Dance Moms.\" Nia  was just 9 years old in the show's pilot. She and her mom, Holly Frazier, starred in it for seven seasons, from 2011 to 2017.",
      "That dream was actualized with the release of \"Bottom of the Pyramid: A Memoir of Persevering, Dancing for Myself, and Starring in My Own Life,\" which hit shelves Nov. 4.",
      "\"I always knew I was going to write a book about my time on 'Dance Moms,'\" Nia tells TODAY.com. \"But it's ever really been the right time. It never really felt right. I don't even think I was really comfortable talking about everything that happened on the show. I was still processing it.\"",
      "The book opens with her casting on the show, and each chapter unveils her side of some of the show's controversial moments, often with her dance teacher and the show's star, Abby Lee Miller, at the center of it. She alleges Miller made racist comments directed at her, tried to bribe a mentor to not work with Nia and most recently, refused Nia's request to visit Miller in the hospital to clear the air after she was diagnosed with cancer. (TODAY.com has reached out to Miller for comment.)",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com after the publication of the memoir, Nia confirms she hasn't heard from Miller about the book.",
      "\"I don't plan on getting anything either,\" Nia says. \"Yeah, no.\"",
      "But bringing that to light isn\u2019t why Nia wrote the book. In the memoir, she writes that after her request to meet was declined, she\u2019ll \u201cnever reach out to Abby Lee Miller again.\u201d She adds that she \u201cdidn\u2019t even want to use her name\u201d in the book.",
      "\"After I had a lot of space away from the show, I realized that that woman really does not have power over me. She really can't dictate my life and control things, and for so long, she made it seem like she controlled the world and she controlled my future,\" Nia says. \"I think having that space away from the show and realizing, like, oh my gosh, actually, she doesn't exist in my world. I can do my own thing and be successful ... and she's not going to get in the way of that.\"",
      "The book seeks to establish Nia as the \"star in my life.\"",
      "Its overarching theme is ironically best described by the title. The bottom of the pyramid, of course, refers to \"Dance Moms'\" episode's fixture in which Miller would rank each dancer in a tiered pyramid based on their performance at their most recent competition.",
      "Fans of the show may remember that typically Nia was toward the bottom, while the coveted top of the pyramid spot was most often dominated by Maddie Ziegler.",
      "\"My dad, at first, was a little concerned. He loved the title, but he also was concerned with it, because I've been trying to kind of shed that title my whole life,\" Nia says. \"So he was like, 'Why would you name your book \"Bottom of the Pyramid\"? Isn't that kind of putting yourself down?'",
      "\"I was like, 'No, it's basically me just reclaiming that title and turning it into a positive,'\" she adds.",
      "For example, she writes in the book, as the bottom of the pyramid she served as her team's base, its glue. And \"at the bottom, the only place you can go is up.\"",
      "\"I'm not shying away from it. I'm not embarrassed by it. I'm just ready to talk,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "But that doesn't mean it was easy. She says the most difficult part was \"trying to tell my story\" while \"not trying to put other people down.\"",
      "\"Anytime I do bring up the girls and situations, I think that part was the hardest for me to write because I never want to paint them in a bad light,\" she says. \"But it's still my experience, and it's still very valid.",
      "\"My relationship with the show was very complicated,\" she adds. \"Although there were times where it was really negative and really challenging, at the same time, it's how I got my start. It's something that is a part of me, and it's something I'm still grateful for, with the good and the bad.\"",
      "Below, Nia discusses how she approached writing the memoir, how some of her fellow castmates have reacted and why the book feels like \"closure\" for the \"Dance Moms\" chapter of her life.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "The hardest part for me was making sure that I wrote everything in the way that I wanted it to be taken. I think that it's really difficult to talk about these sort of things because I come from a place of, you know, I'm healed. I always lead with love. At the same time, I'm not trying to put people down or badmouth anybody. So, trying to find that delicate balance between sharing my story, but (I'm) still not here to protect people. People have been protected this whole time. It was time for me to share my story. And I think that was the hardest part for me, is being OK sharing my story without being worried about what other people thought.",
      "I always knew that I endured a lot. But I feel like every time I read through the book to make my edits and add things, omit things, every single time something came up. Every single time I think I cried in different moments. It's really healing to see your whole story as something tangible, as a book. Literally reading your whole life \u2014\u00a0it's very therapeutic. It's basically my diary; it's like my journal. But it's been so healing. And I think that's the thing that I was so surprised about. It did bring up emotions. I was like, you know what, this might be hard for me to write, and there were times that were hard to write, but for the most part, it was just so healing.",
      "I did. Not every single episode, but the parts that I talk about in the book, I watched it back. I remember things a certain way, and I know how things went down, but I also needed to see how they played out on television to see what the world saw. Sometimes it was the same thing that I remembered. ... But there were a lot of things also that I remember that did happen that the show either cut out or they clipped a certain way.",
      "That was kind of weird, because in my head, I'm like, \"Oh, I thought people knew this.\" I thought it played out this way, but actually, they didn't show any of the stuff I actually went through that week. So watching it back, I mean, I did honestly get irritated at times. I'm like, \"Oh my goodness, they didn't show any of that.\" Watching it, what, 14, 13 years later, having that realization is kind of crazy.",
      "I think I watched the first few episodes of it. When it first came out we had our launch party. ... We watched the first episode when it came on, and I think maybe I probably watched the next couple.",
      "But if I'm being honest, no. One because I don't want to re-live that, I know what happens. But then also, too, I honestly really couldn't. We had no time to even watch anything. The time that the show came out, Tuesdays at 9, we literally had dance. I was at dance while the show was coming out. I would get home and the credits would be rolling. So yeah, even if I wanted to, I couldn't, really.",
      "Chloe did read it before it came out, but I didn't really talk to anyone else about the book before I announced that I was doing it. Chloe was my main girl for that because I knew that she would one, be understanding, and also I really wanted her to write the forward. And she was so excited about it. It was a very special moment when I asked her. I had her obviously read the book before she committed to writing the forward as well. Because, of course, I wanted her to be comfortable with what she was endorsing. She's been so great during this whole process, and I'm really proud of her. And I also know that she's proud of me, and it's been a very special journey.",
      "My mom, actually both my parents, would read chapters as they were done. Any parts I had done, I would have my parents read it, because I value their opinion a lot. They watched every episode and they were the adults, so they would probably remember more than me at times, and then remind me of things. That really helped, trying to get different points of view, making sure that I don't forget the little things.",
      "The book definitely feels like closure. I think before I wrote the book, I had definitely moved on. But I don't know if I really had closure with it because I had never talked about my experience. Not many people actually heard from me when it came to \"Dance Moms.\" So this really was healing. This really was closure. And I also say, this book is also a love letter to my younger self.",
      "Honestly, I feel like there hasn't been a ton from the cast members, reaction-wise. So I don't know whether that's good or bad, but like, I haven't seen too much about that. But I'm grateful for the people that have supported me. Grateful for my mom continuing to support me, grateful for Chloe.",
      "... Having her support means the absolute world because I know that I don't have support from everyone. So it's nice to have somebody, especially Chloe, be so supportive of my story.",
      "Well, my biggest dream is one, to help people. That's what I feel like is my mission, just to help people in any way I can. But also I'm a performer at the end of the day, so storytelling, in any way possible, whether that's through dance, music, acting, theater. Theater was my first love besides dance. So hopefully \u2014 well, not hopefully, I am \u2014\u00a0I'm going to dive back into all of those things.",
      "Now that I'm done with college and now I'm done writing the book and it's released now, I can finally focus on getting back into the swing of things. Before I went to college, I was kind of on a roll, and then I went to college, COVID happened, the actors strike happened. So a lot of things have changed within the past five years. So I'm excited to get back to it. I've been craving getting back to performing, getting back on stage, in any capacity."

      "\u201cEverything has changed, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d Powter told Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin in exclusive TODAY interview on Nov. 18. \u201cBecause I have hope \u2014 real hope. Possibility. Real possibility. And I\u2019m proud that I survived. I didn\u2019t think my being would make it. I didn\u2019t think my energy would survive.",

There was a little bit of money, but not the amount of money that was generated. And I just walked away. I literally walked away. I did it very intentionally.\u201d",
      "She says in the documentary that a fitness business that at one point was millions per year never resulted in the money ending up in her bank account.",

      "\"I really am enjoying acting right now. Whether it\u2019s movies or being on stage or a little something here and there, I think that\u2019s currently what I\u2019m most inspired by,\" she said. \"I\u2019ll still sing, I promise. But yes, right now, that\u2019s currently where I\u2019m at.\"",
      "Grande said she\u2019s also interested in doing more theater because that\u2019s where her career started. Grande made her Broadway debut \u201c13: The Musical\u201d in 2008 when she was about 15 years old.",

      "If there's one thing she's thankful in her life, it's for her fans.",
      "\"My fans are so incredibly supportive of that and of me navigating that in real time and being a curious, creative person who's always wondering what will inspire next,\" she said."

      "Not only did it help launch his career, but it's where he learned to sing and dance.",
      "\"Chita (Rivera) was so sweet and nice, knowing that I didn't dance. She was patient. And she also helped me sing because I wasn't a singer either. I had to learn a lot fast,\" recalls Van Dyke.",
      "Rivera's encouragement paid dividends. \"It won me a Tony and got me attention, it got me a movie,\" he tells Al.",
      "His Broadway run also caught the eye of Carl Reiner, a comedian and writer whose semi-autobiographical sitcom, \"Head of the Family,\" failed to impress TV execs until he cast Van Dyke as the lead and renamed it \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\""

      "KYIV \u2014 Ukrainians were in the dark Thursday.",
      "As the latest wave of Russian drones plunged parts of the country into frigid blackouts, there was disquiet in Kyiv and across Europe over the new 28-point \u201cpeace plan\u201d approved by President Donald Trump, as a senior administration official told NBC News, after weeks of secret negotiations.",
      "Ukraine and its allies on the continent have been frozen out of talks between Washington and Moscow before, and there was conflicting information about whether they were involved this time.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday pushed back at reports that the terms of the plan are favorable to Russia and maintained that Ukraine had been consulted on it.",
      "She said that Trump had grown \u201cincreasingly frustrated\u201d with both countries but that they had been engaged \u201cequally\u201d as Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio worked on the proposals.",
      "No details have been officially released on the plan, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said that he had \u201creceived a draft plan from the American side\u201d in a statement on Telegram.",
      "After a meeting with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll on Thursday, Zelenskyy said there would be \u201cconstructive, honest and swift work\u201d on an effort to end the war, while the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said in a post on X that \u201cmomentum is finally on the side of peace.\u201d",
      "But the swirling sense that the plan may resemble a Russian wishlist threatened a nightmare scenario for Ukraine at a moment of particular peril, with its government mired in a corruption scandal and its military struggling to hold off damaging battlefield setbacks.",
      "Zelenskyy has come under intense pressure this week from his political opponents, who are extremely wary of any deal that would necessitate their country\u2019s capitulation.",
      "\u201cI am not entirely sure who has actually worked on this particular plan,\u201d opposition lawmaker Vadym Ivanchenko said in an interview. \u201cNo one has presented it officially or explained the logic behind its points.\u201d The points currently being discussed in the media, he said, appear to \u201cbe at odds with Ukraine\u2019s interests.\u201d",
      "The U.S. official who spoke to NBC News about the plan said that both Russian and Ukrainian officials were involved in these discussions, but that was at odds with a source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The U.S. official also confirmed reports that Keith Kellogg, the special envoy to Ukraine who had been widely seen as closer to Kyiv, is expected to step down at the end of the year.",
      "The Kremlin has meanwhile remained noncommittal on peace plans.",
      "\u201cIs it true or not?\u201d Sergei Markov, a commentator and a former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, told NBC News of whether a deal had been struck. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "In Kyiv, the timing of the plan was viewed as no coincidence, the source close to the Ukrainian government said, likely an attempt by the Kremlin to take full advantage at an acutely challenging time: Not only do the drones keep falling on its cities, but also Russian forces appear poised to overrun the strategic town of Pokrovsk, a key battlefield victory that could open up the rest of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas heartland to the Russian war machine \u2014 if it isn\u2019t dealt away under pressure from Washington.",
      "Meanwhile, Zelenskyy has been rocked by a $100 million corruption scandal implicating one of his close associates, senior government officials and the country\u2019s vital state-run energy company. He is also facing pressure to fire his all-powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, often seen as the power behind the throne.",
      "Ivanchenko, a lawmaker for the Batkivshchyna political party led by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, conceded that \u201cwe find ourselves in a somewhat vulnerable position.\u201d",
      "It is \u201cnot a catastrophe, not a defeat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also not the position of strength in which we would ideally enter any negotiations.\u201d",
      "Asked Wednesday whether \u201conly\u201d Trump can end this war, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas gave a blunt \u201cno.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn order to end this war, you need the Ukrainians and the Europeans to agree to those plans,\u201d she told reporters. A succession of European foreign ministers, meeting with Kallas in Brussels, expressed caution but made clear they would not allow Kyiv to be forced into capitulation.",
      "Ukrainian officials have little choice, in public at least, to be positive about U.S. efforts \u2014 Zelenskyy found that out the hard way through an Oval Office humiliation by Trump. Since then, a series of summits and meetings have seen the American president appear to waver between favoring Russia or Ukraine and then slipping back again.",
      "\u201cI have a good relationship with President Putin, but I\u2019m a little disappointed in President Putin right now. He knows that,\u201d Trump told the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio struck a balanced tone on X, saying that a \u201cdurable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions.\u201d",
      "Alyona Getmanchuk, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to NATO, said in an interview Wednesday that Trump\u2019s \u201cdetermination to seek a solid diplomatic solution is truly commendable.\u201d Nevertheless, she cautioned, \u201cWhat is crucial for Ukraine is that any peace plan respects our sovereignty and territorial integrity, and prevents future Russian attacks, ensuring that Ukraine is not made an easy target for the next round of aggression.\u201d",
      "Indeed, it\u2019s not just Ukrainians who find these proposals alarming. Many European governments see the idea of ceding territory to Russia, and placing future limits on Ukraine\u2019s capacity to defend itself, as not only rewarding Putin\u2019s aggression, but also emboldening him to strike elsewhere in Europe.",
      "That\u2019s why the reported terms of Trump\u2019s plan create \u201can extremely dangerous international precedent,\u201d according to Danylo Metelskyi, the director of the Center of Social Transformations, a nongovernmental organization based in Kyiv. \u201cIf territories seized by force remain under the control of the aggressor state, it undermines the entire postwar global order.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s position in all of this does not appear to have changed at all: It is still demanding \u201cthe elimination of the root causes of this conflict,\u201d as Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday. That is: Ukraine should cede territory, weaken its military and promise never to join NATO.",
      "Russia has \u201cto navigate between their maximalist objectives\u201d and not risking Trump \u201csupporting Ukraine more than ever,\u201d according to James Nixey, a longtime Moscow-watcher and an independent consultant based in England. \u201cSo it\u2019s tricky for the Russians too. They don\u2019t know how far they can push \u2014 but they\u2019re sure as hell trying.\u201d",
      "The question now is: Will this \u201cgo the way of previous attempts at a peace process? Rejected by Ukraine and Europe,\u201d Nixey added. \u201cOr, will the pressure \u2014 battlefield pressure, societal pressure, U.S. pressure \u2014 be too much for Ukraine and it has to de facto surrender? Because that is what this is.\u201d",
      "Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Alexander Smith and Elmira Aliieva reported from London."

      "LONDON \u2014 A former United Nations investigator who wrote the authoritative report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi told NBC News on Wednesday that she was \u201cshocked and angry\u201d at President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of intelligence saying Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the killing.",
      "Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the secretary general of the watchdog Amnesty International, said there was \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s grisly bone-saw killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. American intelligence said that the crown prince personally approved the operation to kill or kidnap the Washington Post columnist, something the de facto Saudi leader has denied despite apologizing for the murder by his officials.",
      "As the Saudi leader visited the White House on Tuesday, Trump disavowed the findings by his own intelligence agencies, saying the crown prince \u201cknew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,\u201d even chiding the enquiring reporter for trying to \u201cembarrass our guests by asking a question like that.\u201d",
      "Trump called Khashoggi \u201cextremely controversial\u201d and claimed that \u201ca lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He added, \u201cWhether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen.\u201d",
      "The remarks surprised Callamard, who while serving as the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary killings investigated Khashoggi\u2019s murder and in 2019 wrote arguably the most detailed and authoritative report about what happened.",
      "\u201cI was astonished, shocked and angry,\u201d Callamard said of Trump's comments. \u201cWhat\u2019s controversial is flying 15 operatives from Saudi Arabia to a foreign country to commit a murder.\u201d",
      "There is \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that Crown Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, she maintained. \u201cAnd frankly, there is no doubt in the mind of anyone who knows Saudi Arabia.\u201d",
      "Trump's remarks have provoked widespread outrage.",
      "Khashoggi\u2019s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, told Reuters that she wished Trump could meet \u201cthe real Jamal,\u201d and that nothing can \u201cjustify just a horrible crime.\u201d.",
      "The Washington Post called \u201cTrump\u2019s performance at the White House \u2026 weak, crass and of no strategic benefit to America.\u201d And the National Press Club warned the remarks would have \u201creal-world consequences,\u201d including emboldening authoritarian states that \u201cwish to silence reporters.\"",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House and the Saudi Embassy in London for a response to the criticisms contained in this story.",
      "Some Middle East analysts say that despite the global outrage, Trump\u2019s comments reflect his desire to build on the deep economic ties between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "During the Saudi leader\u2019s visit this week, Trump announced he would sell the crown prince F-35 fighter jets, treating his guest to a flyover of the high-tech planes, as well as a gunfire salute.",
      "Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest buyer of American weapons. In May, the U.S. announced it was selling the Gulf state almost $142 billion of \u201cstate-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services,\u201d part of a wider $600 billion investment package.",
      "Despite the lavish welcome, Trump did not appear to make headway on his wish for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, a group of Arab nations that have recognized the state of Israel. The crown prince told the Oval Office he did not want to sign anything \u201cuntil we secure a clear path of two-state solution\u201d for Palestinians.",
      "Trump has \u201calways been pretty clear that the relationship with Saudi Arabia is important to him and that he gets on with Mohammed bin Salman,\u201d said Michael Stephens, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \u201cI suspect Trump did not want the trip to be derailed.\u201d",
      "Noting past controversial statements from Trump \u2014 including calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator,\u201d before retracting it \u2014 Stephens said such remarks should be taken with a \u201cpinch of salt.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I view this as is relationship management, making sure that Saudi Arabia and [bin Salman] feel personally supported by Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "The crown prince himself called Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cpainful\u201d and a \u201chuge mistake\u201d Tuesday, while offering little encouragement other than a polite smile to Trump\u2019s overtures.",
      "He said his kingdom had taken \u201call the right steps of investigation\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve improved our system to be sure that nothing\u201d similar happens again.",
      "Indeed, the crown prince has been attempting to transform the kingdom from a conservative, oil-rich theocracy into a major economic power built on business, tourism, entertainment and sports.",
      "There have been some reforms, including removing the requirement for women to wear headscarves in public, allowing them to drive and to attend soccer matches.",
      "Saudi authorities have worked hard to wash away the anger over human rights abuses and the killing of Khashoggi, who was lured into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain a document, before being killed and dismembered by the 15-member Saudi team waiting there. His remains have never been recovered.",
      "A 2021 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence cited \"the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman's protective detail in the operation\" and concluded it was \"highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince's authorization.\"",
      "The kingdom still has an \u201cabysmal human rights record,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch, crushing political dissent and executing at least 300 people this year.",
      "Presenting Crown Prince Mohammed as \"a beacon or an icon of modernity for his country is a joke,\" Callamard said, calling the kingdom's reforms \"very superficial.\"",
      "She noted that Trump was merely \"the latest in a succession of global leaders who have normalized and legitimized Mohammed bin Salman within the international community and the international context.\"",
      "While he was a presidential candidate, Joe Biden called the kingdom a \u201cpariah,\u201d only to receive widespread criticism in 2022 for traveling to Saudi Arabia and fist-bumping the crown prince, an incident derided by Trump on Tuesday.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia is being acknowledged because of its geostrategic interest, because of its oil resources, because of the fact that it is key to any attempt of bringing peace to the Middle East,\" she said. \"I don't see that as a recognition of [Crown Prince Mohammed] as anything other than a killer.\""

      "The mystery surrounding a plane that arrived in South Africa carrying more than 150 Palestinians deepened Wednesday after the company at the center of the saga responded to media coverage.",
      "Inconsistencies involving the public profile of Al-Majd Europe, a company that some on the flight said organized their travel, have only added to the uncertainty over how the passengers were able to leave the Middle East and who was ultimately behind their voyage.",
      "In a lengthy statement late Tuesday, Al-Majd did not directly acknowledge organizing the flight, which South Africa labeled \u201ca clearly orchestrated operation,\u201d after it landed in Johannesburg last week to the surprise of authorities.",
      "Al-Majd said that its \u201conly interaction with the Israeli authorities is for the purpose of coordinating exits from Gaza.\u201d",
      "South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told reporters Monday that the flight was part of \u201ca clear agenda to cleanse the Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d",
      "He did not say who was behind this alleged effort, but his comments were widely seen as being directed at Israel as the fragile ceasefire in Gaza intensifies questions about the fate of the 2 million Palestinians living in the devastated enclave.",
      "South Africa, a staunch Israel critic and supporter of the Palestinian cause, filed a case at the United Nations' International Court of Justice in late 2023 accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, which Israel has vehemently rejected. The case remains ongoing.",
      "\u201cWe are suspicious as the South African government about the circumstances surrounding the arrival of the plane and the passengers that were in the plane,\u201d Lamola said, adding that his country was investigating further and did not want more such flights heading its way.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said the Palestinians left Gaza after it had received approval from a third country to receive them. COGAT did not name the third country.",
      "An Israeli government spokesperson said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201chas made it clear\u201d that Gazans should be allowed to leave Gaza and come back as they please.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that no one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return.",
      "But fears of ethnic cleansing have persisted among Palestinians and their supporters. Israel's government instructed its military in February to prepare a plan for Palestinians to voluntarily leave the enclave, after it embraced a Trump proposal for Gaza to be emptied of its residents and taken over by the United States.",
      "'Flushed out' of Gaza",
      "The chartered plane arrived at Johannesburg\u2019s O. R. Tambo International Airport on Thursday, appearing to blindside the South African government.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters Friday the Palestinians were from Gaza and were \u201cmysteriously\u201d put on a plane. They did not have the necessary documents to enter, he  said, but wouldn\u2019t be turned back because they come \u201cfrom a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\u201d",
      "He said South Africa would take them in \u201cout of compassion\u201d but added \u201cit does seem like they were being, you know, flushed out.\u201d",
      "South Africa\u2019s Border Management Authority said that the passengers on board the plane did not indicate duration of stay or accommodation in South Africa, and did not have exit stamps in their passports.",
      "They were initially denied entry, but 130 passengers had since been processed into the care of a South African nongovernmental organization called Gift of the Givers, which helps with relief efforts in war zones and disaster areas.",
      "The other 23 continued to other destinations, the Border Management Authority said. Palestinians are eligible for 90-day visa-exempt travel to South Africa, it added.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the South African government for further comment.",
      "It was not immediately clear how the Palestinians on board would have been able to leave Israel without proper documents.",
      "Questions over who's behind the flight",
      "Reuters spoke with two Palestinians who said they paid $2,000 per seat to fly their families to South Africa on the plane, as part of a trip arranged by an organization called Al-Majd Europe. They said they were bused from Gaza, and taken through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing before being flown out of an Israeli airport last week.",
      "NBC News initially reached out to Al-Majd Europe on Tuesday via an email listed on its website but did not hear back. Its location is only listed as Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem, with an embedded map with a pin pointing to a building behind a hospital and the British Consulate.",
      "NBC News' analysis of its online presence revealed a number of inconsistencies.",
      "Al-Majd says it's a \u201chumanitarian organization, founded in 2010 in Germany\u201d but NBC News found no evidence that its website existed before February this year. Its Facebook and X accounts were also created this year. NBC News also could not find the organization in the register of the German tax administration.",
      "NBC News determined that a photo accompanying the \u201cabout\u201d page shows a building with the Al-Majd sign and Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock in the background was AI-generated. The website has multiple blog posts with case study-style summaries of its claimed work as a charity during the war in Syria and the earthquake in Turkey. While the website was created this year, the blog posts are dated from 2023.",
      "One of the case studies listed shows a photo of a woman it calls Mona Farouk, who it says left Syria for neighboring Lebanon in 2013, and then needed Al-Majd's help in 2014 to flee the fighting again. A reverse image search led NBC News to a Middle East Eye article last year with the same photo, which the news organization credits to its own journalist. The article names the woman in the photo as Abeer Khayat, and says she left Syria in 2012.",
      "The website has a terms and conditions page that states that \u201cthe organizing entity\u201d for the \u201cVoluntary Migration Program\u201d to leave the Gaza strip is Talent Globus.",
      "NBC News found that it is a company registered in Estonia in 2024 by a person named Tomer Janar Lind. NBC News has reached out to an account with the same name on LinkedIn. The United Kingdom's business registry shows Lind as a director in two dissolved companies and one active company with overdue accounts. None of them appear to be linked to Talent Globus.",
      "The Talent Globus website lists four employees, three of whom are shown with stock images that are available online. The company's \u201cabout\u201d section says it\u2019s been around for a decade, yet the company records say it was founded in 2024. The phone number listed doesn\u2019t work when called.",
      "The company released a statement on X late Tuesday in order to \"directly address the false accusations and disinformation circulated by parties with clear political interests\" that it said were meant \u201cto strip the people of Gaza of their freedom of choice.\u201d",
      "It said it had no connection to Israel\u2019s Mossad or any other intelligence services, and claimed that it \"was founded by refugees who escaped dictatorial regimes, including refugees from Hamas rule in Gaza.\"",
      "The statement did not directly mention the Palestinians who arrived in South Africa last week or the inconsistencies on its website.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Al-Majd for further clarification.",
      "The Palestinian Embassy in South Africa told NBC News that it was closely monitoring the situation and liaising with South African authorities to ensure the protection and well-being of all Palestinian nationals involved, but that \u201cdue to the sensitivity of the matter,\u201d the embassy was not able to provide further details at this time.",

It warned that any companies that \u201clure\u201d Palestinians and \u201cincite them to deportation\u201d will bear legal consequences while cautioning Palestinians not to fall prey to \u201chuman trafficking.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Meta announced Thursday that it will close the Instagram and Facebook accounts of Australian users under age 16 early next month as the country\u2019s landmark social media ban begins to take effect.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it had begun notifying affected users to download their contacts and memories before their accounts are deleted from its platforms, starting from Dec. 4, sparking concerns about potential privacy violations and shrinking spaces for young people.",
      "The world-first law comes as lawmakers across the globe wrestle with the impacts of teens\u2019 internet access, with the European Union also considering age restrictions on social media use, while the U.K. has imposed mandatory age checks for sites likely to contain adult content.",
      "Australia has earned a reputation for confrontations with Silicon Valley giants, with a past showdown forcing tech companies to pay for news content used on social media. The country has also weighed rules punishing tech giants for spreading misinformation, and has rejected calls for AI-friendly changes to copyright law.",
      "Meta said in a statement Thursday that it would kick off users it understands to be under the age of 16 using \u201cage assurance methods\u201d by Dec. 10, when Australia\u2019s new law comes into effect. Teenage users can have their access restored once they turn 16, the company said.",
      "TikTok, X, Snapchat and Reddit are also set to be age-restricted under the law, according to a list shared by Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner agency, while YouTube will restrict underage users to a child-friendly version.",
      "Messaging apps like Meta\u2019s WhatsApp and Messenger platforms are excluded from the ban.",
      "Meta said that accurately determining a user\u2019s age would prove \u201ca challenge for the entire industry,\u201d stressing that Australian authorities recognize the likelihood of \u201cnatural error margins.\u201d",
      "Users above 16 who are mistakenly affected can verify their age by uploading a government-issued ID or a video selfie, similar to the age check tools already rolled out in the U.K.",
      "Australian lawmakers cited the impact of excessive use on children\u2019s physical and mental health as they pushed through the law cutting off social media access to under-16s last year. A YouGov poll last year found that 77% of Australians supported the legislation.",
      "Under the ban, social media platforms bear sole responsibility for enforcement, with systemic failures punishable by fines of up to $33 million.",
      "About 96% of children ages 10 to 15 in Australia have used social media, according to a July report by the eSafety Commissioner. Nearly 350,000 Australian kids ages 13-15 use Instagram, official data showed.",
      "Earlier this month, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he is \u201cconfident\u201d that the ban will be \u201csuccessful,\u201d defending it as an \u201cappropriate government response\u201d to demands from parents rather than a top-down order.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the history of social change for common good,\u201d Albanese told Australian public broadcaster ABC News. \u201cThis will empower parents to talk with their kids.\u201d",
      "However, experts have voiced concerns about the practicality and possible harms that may arise.",
      "Meta will use AI tools to estimate the age of existing users, possibly leading to errors and misidentification, said Rahat Masood, a senior cybersecurity lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.",
      "Signals such as a user\u2019s likes and interests \u201chelp the platform \u2018guess\u2019 a user\u2019s age, but they are never 100% accurate,\u201d Masood said, especially given that adolescents are the \u201chardest age group to estimate accurately,\u201d as their demographic cues are \u201cnot stable.\u201d",
      "Australian authorities have \u201cno transparent framework\u201d for auditing tech companies\u2019 age verification systems and there is a \u201creal risk of privacy violations,\u201d Masood said.",
      "Many teenagers will look for workarounds such as VPNs to set up accounts in other countries or will use borrowed accounts, said Faith Gordon, an associate professor at the Australian National University\u2019s School of Law.",
      "\u201cThe greater concern is that some teenagers may drift toward far less regulated corners of the internet, including encrypted networks or the dark web, simply to stay connected,\u201d Gordon said.",
      "\u201cThese spaces carry significantly higher risks, from exposure to harmful content to exploitation, and they are far harder for parents, educators and regulators to monitor and keep track of,\u201d she added.",
      "Andrew K. Przybylski, a professor of human behavior and technology at the University of Oxford, said he hopes the rest of the world won\u2019t follow in the footsteps of Australia in issuing an \u201coutright ban\u201d of social media for young people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame,\u201d Przybylski said, noting that similar social media bans \u201csound good but always backfire\u201d by closing off \u201can important outlet for self-discovery and expression\u201d for young people.",
      "\u201cI am not waiting until our kids turn 16 to use social media,\u201d he added. \u201cKids need our advice, guidance and feedback. They\u2019re way more likely to fully engage with us before\u200b they turn 16.\u201d"

      "Consistently rated one of Britain\u2019s most popular royals, Kate appears to have eased into a fuller return to public duties this week.",
      "She made her first in-person speech Monday since she shared her cancer diagnosis 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cThe love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults,\u201d Kate said, addressing business leaders at the Future Workforce Summit in London about the importance of early childhood, a cause she has championed for years.",
      "\u201cLove is the first and most essential bond.\u201d",
      "The princess has made a growing number of public appearances since she announced this year that her cancer was in remission, but the speech appears to bring her back into the royal fold more permanently.",
      "\"Welcome back, Princess,\" beamed the Daily Telegraph front page.",
      "She drew more positive coverage after a further appearance Wednesday evening for one of the most joyful events on the royal calendar, the annual Royal Variety Performance, telling well-wishers it was \u201cso nice to be back\u201d at the event, according to British media.",
      "She returns after weeks of torrid headlines for the family, with the king stripping his brother Andrew of his princely title last month amid growing scrutiny over his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\u201cWhat you see and hear about Catherine is the monarchy doing the sort of work that it should be doing today,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "He told NBC News that the speech focusing on early childhood was a \u201cgood moment\u201d for the family, reflective of its role taking on \u201cinteresting but not directly political causes.\u201d",
      "The focus has been on anything but the family\u2019s normal load of public engagements and ribbon cutting in recent years as the royals have endured a stream of uncertainty and upheaval since Queen Elizabeth II's death in 2022.",
      "The royal family was shaken early last year by the announcement that Charles, then 75, had been diagnosed with cancer after just two years on the throne, for which he is still undergoing treatment.",
      "Relations with the media were then undercut by a damaging saga when Kate, then largely absent from the public eye, admitted having altered a family photo released by the palace. Weeks later, Kate announced her diagnosis and said she was undergoing chemotherapy.",
      "The king has also been working to heal a rift with his son Prince Harry, who stepped down from his royal duties in 2020. They met for a private tea in September, their first meeting in almost two years; William was not present.",
      "It was the king\u2019s younger brother Andrew who generated what Prescott called the first significant crisis of Charles\u2019 reign, with fresh revelations about his ties to Epstein last month spurring the king to strip his royal titles and eject him from his home in Windsor.",
      "Earlier this month, 16 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote to ask the former prince, now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, to cooperate with their inquiry into Epstein. Thursday is the deadline for Andrew to respond.",
      "Now, with Kate seemingly back on the royal front line, there appears to be an opportunity to refocus, royal observers said.",
      "\u201cThis was Kate\u2019s first speech in two years, and she looked very polished, very calm and confident, and she is clearly in a really good place,\u201d said Emily Nash, royal editor at HELLO! Magazine. \u201cWe can expect to see a lot more of this going forward.\u201d",
      "Kate regularly polls as one of the most popular members of the royal family.",
      "Her favorability rating stood at 73% in October, according to a poll by YouGov, just below that of her husband, Prince William, at 76%. The royal family in general had a 59% favorability rating.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that she\u2019s never put a foot wrong,\u201d Prescott said. A sense of affection and support for William after his mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash extended to Kate after she married into the royal family and \u201cgave her a good platform from which to build,\u201d he added.",
      "Like the late queen, she is someone who takes her role as a member of the royal family very seriously and understands the concept of duty, Prescott said."

      "The competition, which generates most of its revenue from licensing regional broadcasting rights, was sold to Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, a Thai businesswoman, for $20 million in 2022.",
      "Over the years, Miss Universe has suffered from slumping viewership as criticism rose over its objectification of women.",
      "While the competition has made modest strides under Jakrajutatip\u2019s ownership, such as allowing married women and mothers to compete, complaints of sexual harassment and rigging have continued across almost every iteration."

      "The two largest economies in Asia have been locked in a war of words that began when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told lawmakers Nov. 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a military response from Tokyo. It was the first time such a comment had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, a U.S. ally that has a mutual defense pact with Washington.",
      "China, which claims self-ruling Taiwan as a breakaway province to be seized by force if necessary, has repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks, saying it will take \u201csevere\u201d countermeasures if she refuses.",
      "Though unspecified, Beijing\u2019s threats have fueled concerns for Japan\u2019s already fragile economy, which is heavily dependent on China, especially as Tokyo grapples with the effects of U.S. tariffs.",
      "On Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry suggested that China might reimpose its ban on imports of Japanese seafood because Japan has \u201cso far failed\u201d to provide documents proving the quality and safety of its aquatic products.",
      "China resumed importing seafood from all but 10 Japanese prefectures this month after having suspended imports two years ago over the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan\u2019s wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s comments about Taiwan have triggered \u201cstrong public outrage in China,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cUnder the current circumstances, even if Japanese aquatic products were exported to China, they would have no market.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s newest sign of economic retaliation came days after authorities advised Chinese citizens not to travel to Japan, saying Takaichi\u2019s \u201cblatantly provocative\u201d Taiwan remarks posed a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the safety of Chinese people in the country.",
      "Japan, which says it continues to prefer a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, has also advised its citizens to take extra safety precautions in China.",
      "\u201cThe government will continue to closely monitor the situation, including the impact of the series of measures by China, and take appropriate action,\u201d Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Following the government\u2019s instructions, several major Chinese airlines have started offering free refunds or itinerary changes for eligible tickets for flights to and from Japan.",
      "The number of canceled flights was not immediately clear. Some travel businesses have reported disruption and losses amid the China-Japan tensions.",
      "East Japan International Travel Agency, a Tokyo-based tour operator offering tailored services to Chinese tourists, said tat about 70% of its group tours had been canceled, marking a \u201csignificant surge,\u201d and that new inquiries had also decreased about 90%.",
      "\u201cNormally, the period from late December to the Lunar New Year is peak season for corporate incentive travel,\u201d Yu Jixin, the agency\u2019s vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut this year, almost none of these groups are expected to visit Japan.\u201d",
      "Beijing Huatu International Travel Agency said it had suspended bookings for Japan-related tours until further orders from Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cWe are all Chinese people of flesh and blood,\u201d it said Monday in a statement on RedNote, China\u2019s Instagram-like platform. \u201cWe will never waver when it comes to the fundamentals of right and wrong.\u201d",
      "The releases of at least two Japanese movies \u2014 \u201cCrayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers\u201d and \u201cCells at Work!\u201d \u2014 will be postponed in mainland China, state-backed media China Film News said Monday.",
      "Chinese film importers and distributors said they made the \u201ccautious\u201d adjustment in response to viewers\u2019 \u201cwidespread and intense dissatisfaction\u201d with Takaichi\u2019s remarks.",
      "The delays were announced as the Japanese anime sensation \u201cDemon Slayer: Infinity Castle\u201d has raked in more than $60 million since its Chinese premiere Friday, accounting for 50% of the country\u2019s daily box office through Wednesday, according to data from the Chinese box office tracker Beacon.",
      "The pausing of film premieres by China, even though it is a \u201cfairly normal practice,\u201d sends a \u201cclear signal\u201d to Japan, said Hong Zeng, professor of cultural studies at Hong Kong Baptist University.",
      "\u201cThis is not an isolated gesture within the film sector,\u201d Zeng said, noting that it would be \u201csurprising\u201d if all the actions taken by Beijing, including its travel warning, \u201cwere merely coincidental.\u201d",
      "Madoka Fukuda, a professor of international politics and China studies at Hosei University in Tokyo, said it was not \u201crealistic\u201d for Takaichi to retract her remarks.",
      "\u201cAt this point, China\u2019s measures will affect specific industries but will not cause significant political damage to the Japanese government,\u201d she said in emailed comments.",
      "But tensions are likely to persist for the long term, Fukuda said.",
      "\u201cI believe Japan can only maintain a consistent stance of dialogue,\u201d she said, \u201ccalling on China to engage while waiting for an opportunity for China to de-escalate its protests.\u201d"

    "summary": "At least 10 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack that struck a residential tower block in the city of Ternopil, Ukrainian officials said.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump this week approved a 28-point plan for peace between Russia and Ukraine that top administration officials have quietly developed over the last several weeks in consultation with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Ukrainian officials, a senior administration official told NBC News.",
      "Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner were involved in formulating the plan, the official said.",
      "\u201cThe plan focuses on giving both sides security guarantees to secure a lasting peace,\u201d the senior official told NBC News. \u201cIt includes things Ukraine wants and needs to have a durable peace.\u201d",
      "The official would not outline details of a plan that the official believes is still up for some degree of negotiation with the key parties involved. Axios first reported the existence of the plan.",
      "Three U.S. officials told NBC News that the framework for the peace deal still needed to be presented to the Ukrainians and that the timing of finalizing a draft of the plan coincided with the visit of an Army delegation to Ukraine.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas. And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions,\" Rubio posted on X on Wednesday. \"That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "The American delegation arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday morning with two missions for its meetings with Ukrainian officials: to discuss military strategy and technology and to help revive the peace process, according to two U.S. officials, a European official and a source close to the Ukrainian government.",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was joined by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Randy George, and other top Army officials, Col. Dave Butler, an Army spokesperson, said in a statement, hours after Ukrainian police said at least 25 people were killed in heavy overnight Russian missile and drone attacks.",
      "A U.S. official described the trip as a White House plan intended to \u201crestart peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "American efforts to revive peace negotiations appear to be gaining momentum, although the Kremlin has shown no sign of changing its terms for ending the war and it played down a media report that the United States was working on a 28-point peace plan.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing that there were \u201cno such plans\u201d for Russia to meet Driscoll after his talks in Kyiv, indicating there had been little change since talks in Alaska in August.",
      "A defense official said that Driscoll has been briefed on the 28-point plan but that is not the main focus of his meetings in Kyiv.",
      "Ukraine did not take part in shaping the proposed peace plan, according to a source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter. Ukraine was informed of the broad contours of the plan but was not briefed in detail and was not asked to provide input, the two sources said.",
      "Ukrainian officials view the timing of the proposal, coinciding with a damaging corruption scandal facing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government, as no coincidence, the source close to the Ukrainian government said, and the officials see it as most likely an attempt by the Kremlin to take advantage of a potentially weakened Ukrainian leadership.",
      "A Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has led on legislation to punish Russia for its actions in Ukraine, told NBC News he was not previously aware of the plan.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d said Graham, who spoke to Trump on Tuesday evening. \u201cBut I will say this: I hope there\u2019s no plan out there \u2014 no plan will work unless [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes that we\u2019re serious about continuing to provide higher end military aid to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The U.S. delegation in Kyiv is discussing military matters, including air defense efforts against Russian drone and missile attacks on the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, and mapping the front line to help a possible peace process, said the source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Previous diplomatic efforts led by Witkoff also excluded Ukraine and collapsed, as Kyiv and NATO allies viewed the proposals as lopsided in Moscow\u2019s favor with little realistic prospect of resolving the conflict.",
      "Russia has consistently demanded severe restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, prohibiting the country from joining the NATO alliance and barring the presence of Western troops to secure any peace.",
      "\u201cThe president has been clear that it is time to stop the killing and make a deal to end the war. President Trump believes that there is a chance to end this senseless war if flexibility is shown,\u201d a White House official said.",
      "Driscoll and his delegation arrived in the Ukrainian capital after an overnight Russian missile and drone attack on several Ukrainian cities.",
      "After an apartment building was hit in the western city of Ternopil, the National Police of Ukraine said on Telegram that 25 people, including three children, were killed.",
      "Sixty-six more people were wounded in the strikes, which targeted energy and transportation infrastructure, forcing emergency power cuts in a number of regions, said officials, who added that Russia launched more than 470 drones and 48 missiles.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that it \u201ccarried out a massive strike with long-range, high-precision air- and sea-launched weapons\u201d in response \u201cto Ukraine\u2019s terrorist attacks on civilian facilities.\u201d It added that it had targeted \u201cmilitary-industrial facilities and energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly said its only targets are linked to Kyiv\u2019s war effort, but it has been pummeling Ukraine with near-daily drone and missile strikes that have killed and wounded civilians.",
      "It has also targeted Ukraine\u2019s energy sector in a bid to plunge the country into the cold and dark ahead of winter.",
      "Energy infrastructure had been struck in seven Ukrainian regions, officials said Wednesday. Explosions were also reported in the western city of Lviv.",
      "The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but restrictions were placed on power usage for consumers across the country, according to Reuters.",
      "In Ternopil on Wednesday, the upper floors of the residential building were torn away in the attack. Black smoke poured upward, while an orange glow burned though the haze from a fire in the tower block.",
      "Zelenskyy confirmed that multistory residential buildings had been hit in the city, and said others may be trapped under the rubble.",
      "He also urged allies to increase pressure on Russia to end its nearly four-year war in Ukraine, including by providing Kyiv with more air defense missiles.",
      "\u201cEvery brazen attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient. Effective sanctions and assistance to Ukraine can change this,\u201d he said on X.",
      "Elsewhere, Poland scrambled Polish and allied aircraft and temporarily closed airports in the southeastern cities of Rzesz\u00f3w and Lublin as a precaution to safeguard the airspace over the NATO member state, which borders western Ukraine."

      "If the library system in the Canadian city of Hamilton, Ontario, handed out fines for overdue books, the one for a recently returned tome titled \u201cThe Excellent Woman\u201d would be a whopper.",
      "The Victorian-era guidebook for ambitious Christian women by a British writer named Anne Pratt appears to have been checked out about 135 years ago from the Hamilton Public Library, a spokesperson for the library said.",
      "And the suspected scofflaw, a \"Miss Charlotte Morgan\" of Central School in Hamilton, incriminated herself by writing her name on a back page.",
      "\u201cWe know she was a teacher at the school in the 1890s, and we know she died in 1942,\u201d Robert Moore, a history teacher who found the book in his late father\u2019s house and returned it to the library last week, told NBC News. \u201cThe mystery now is when exactly in the 1890s she checked the book out and how it wound up behind the grate at the school where my father found it 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "As for the book, it appears to be one of the first volumes that appeared on the shelves when the library opened its doors in September 1890, Moore said. \u201cInside it is listed as book No. 54, written by hand in ink,\u201d he said.",
      "Shelley McKay, a spokesperson for the library, said, \u201cThis might be one of the original books from the original Hamilton library.\u201d",
      "McKay said this edition was published in 1852 in Boston, five years after it made its debut in England.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in good shape,\u201d she said. \u201cI should look so good at its age.\u201d",
      "Moore said his father, Tom, was a \u201cstationary engineer\u201d at what was then called the Central Public School. He said his dad was doing some renovations on the heating system when he stumbled across the book and brought it home.",
      "\u201cI remember him showing it to us, and I remember reading it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt had all these beautiful illustrations and very flowery Victorian language. \u201c",
      "Moore said that it sat on a bookshelf until his father died this year and that he came across it when he was cleaning out the house.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018This has got to go back to the library,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "It was welcomed back with open arms, McKay said.",
      "\u201cHe brought it to our Sherwood branch, and we were more than a little surprised and taken aback by the discovery,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked whether she had had a chance to peruse the book, McKay said she had.",
      "\u201cI would say it\u2019s of its time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a beautiful book. The illustrations are gorgeous.\u201d",
      "While Pratt wrote the book, her name does not appear on the title page on this edition. Instead, the name of the author of the introduction, a Protestant clergyman named William B. Sprague, is prominently displayed.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s because Sprague was well-known at the time,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe had his sermons published. And there was still a stigma against books by women writers.\u201d",
      "Pratt\u2019s book is essentially a commentary on the Bible\u2019s Book of Proverbs, which discusses \u2014 and offers tips on \u2014 how women should behave.",
      "Moore said the book, for its time, was \u201cvery empowering for women,\u201d although it might not go over well with \u201chard-core feminists\" today.",
      "\u201cAnne Pratt was very critical of vapid women in England who just aimed to marry well and go to parties,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe was encouraging women to do more with their lives, to be in a partnership with their husbands and not just submit to their husbands.\u201d",
      "McKay said that the recovery of Pratt\u2019s book has generated great excitement in Hamilton and that she has gotten numerous calls from people who want to see it.",
      "\u201cWe hope this will encourage people to look under their beds in their closets and return those old library materials,\u201d McKay said.",
      "But there are no plans to put Pratt's book back out into circulation.",
      "\u201cThis is heading to the archives,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cYou\u2019re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in response to questions from a journalist about Khashoggi. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about. Whether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen, but [the crown prince] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Trump began his remarks by saying that he was proud of the crown prince in \u201cterms of human rights and everything else.\u201d",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government. At the time, Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.",
      "Trump lashed out at a reporter from ABC News who asked the crown prince about Khashoggi's death and about criticism from the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many of whom have long pushed for answers on the Saudi government's potential ties to the attackers.",
      "\"ABC, fake news, one of the worst, one of the worst in the business,\" he said.",
      "The crown prince dismissed the criticisms against the Saudi government as part of a campaign to drive a wedge between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America,\" he said. \"But you know, we have to focus on reality.\"",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed also defended the kingdom\u2019s probe into Khashoggi's murder, which he said included internal reforms. A Saudi court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in the killing.",

While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.\"",

      "Khashoggi's death has highlighted the risks journalists face around the world, particularly in areas where there is conflict. A report from the Committee to Protect Journalists released in February said that at least 124 journalists and media workers were killed in 2024, mainly Palestinian journalists killed as a result of Israel's military offensive in Gaza.",
      "The crown prince's trip Tuesday will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven\u2019t gone away. But he\u2019s a changed figure; it\u2019s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts.",

      "Trump\u2019s welcome of the crown prince was an elaborate display of pomp and circumstance. After arriving at the White House, the crown prince was greeted by a military flyover of stealth fighter jets, officers on horseback and a tour of the Rose Garden from Trump. Later, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president praised the reception that he received when he visited the kingdom this year. \u201cI love the country and people,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump and the crown prince joked about investing $1 trillion \u2014 a sum roughly equal to Saudi Arabia's entire wealth fund \u2014 into the United States, up from a $600 billion pledge.",
      "The two leaders are also expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "Even before the crown prince had set foot in the United States, Trump confirmed at an Oval Office event Monday that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, a contentious move that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where Israel has been the primary recipient of America\u2019s cutting-edge military technology. Trump repeated the pledge Tuesday and promised a deal.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement of the sale may not actually lead to Saudi Arabia receiving the F-35s anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe devil will kind of be in the details there,\u201d said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia, noting that a similar deal announced with the United Arab Emirates fell through.",
      "He added, \u201cThat deal ultimately ran aground on a combination of U.S. concerns with maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and concerns about the extent to which U.S. security technology might leak to China.\u201d",
      "Trump designated Saudi Arabia a \u201cMajor Non-NATO Ally\" on Tuesday, noting that the classification would take the country\u2019s military cooperation with the United States \u201cto even greater heights.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou always had a little cloud over your head, and sometimes that cloud was very big. That cloud is not there anymore, and we want to keep it that way,\u201d Trump said before he announced the designation at a dinner honoring Crown Prince Mohammed.",
      "Major Non-NATO Ally status is a designation that \u201cprovides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation,\u201d according to the State Department. It does not, however, require U.S. security commitments to such countries.",
      "The possibility of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel is a key part of the talks. \u201cI already brought it up,\" Trump said when asked about the prospect of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led a number of regional countries to establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel. \"I don\u2019t want to use the word 'commitment,' but we had a good talk,\" he said.",
      "Analysts have been skeptical about a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no near-term horizon for normalization at the moment,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "\"The risks for Mohammed bin Salman are extremely high if he joins the Abraham Accords,\" agreed Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He noted that Saudi Arabia had made clear it would need some form of Israeli commitment to a path to a Palestinian state \u2014 something Israel has publicly dismissed.",
      "The crown prince's strategy was generally \"to minimize the risks to his rule,\" Gerges said.",
      "Even if the crown prince does not announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel, he has won favor with Trump as one of the regional leaders who helped pull together the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities and, according to a senior administration official, a number of deals are expected to be announced Tuesday, including a multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in America\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.",
      "Critics have raised questions about Trump\u2019s affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. His properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. And The New York Times reported this weekend that the Trump Organization is looking at a huge real estate deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some massive ethical questions in here,\u201d Leber of the Carnegie Endowment said. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line.\u201d",
      "Trump, asked about his family\u2019s business ties to Saudi Arabia, said they \u201cdo business all over,\u201d and that he's no longer involved in the activities.",
      "Governments dealing with Saudi Arabia, human rights groups have long said, should also push the country\u2019s leaders on its dismal human rights record. In August, a report from Human Rights Watch noted an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d in executions in 2025, with 241 people put to death as of Aug. 5.",
      "Still, the restrictions on women, another regular criticism leveled at the kingdom, have been eased, and the crown prince has tried to open up the society to Western exports, like Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and comedy shows, though the comedians who recently appeared at a comedy festival in Riyadh, including Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, were blasted for performing there.",
      "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been political reform in the sense of creating space for real politics, but he\u2019s absolutely, fundamentally reoriented Saudi society and changed the role of the religious authorities,\u201d Hanna of the ICG said. \u201cThere\u2019s incredible social change that has happened partly because he\u2019s operating without any real constraints.\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan may have passed the U.N. Security Council. But there are still major questions of how it will work.",
    "story": [
      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, this was \"one of the biggest approvals in the history of the United Nations,\" a \"moment of true historic proportion\" that would \" lead to further peace all over the world.\" But the gravity of the U.N. Security Council's endorsement of the U.S. Gaza plan raised renewed questions Tuesday over how it will actually work.",
      "Most pressingly, it is not clear whether those at the heart of the conflict \u2014 the Palestinians and the Israelis themselves \u2014 actually support its end goals.",
      "Hamas, which still controls around half of the strip, outright rejected the resolution and said it robs Palestinians of their own agency, effectively giving Trump free rein over the Gaza Strip for the next two years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed its passage, but he previously said he rejects its talk of \"Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "On a practical level, the proposal says it will require the creation of several as-yet-nonexistent bodies, including the \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d headed by Trump and the International Stabilization Force, or ISF, whose troops could be drawn from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates and as far away as Indonesia.",
      "That having been said, this was a rare moment of geopolitical unity.",
      "Trump's team won the support of Arab states by inserting language hinting at a future Palestinian state, and Russia and China abstained from the vote rather than use their vetoes to torpedo the proposal outright.",
      "It passed 13-0.",
      "Summarizing the mood Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the vote as \"an important step\" but cautioned that it was \"essential now to translate the diplomatic momentum into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "It's a sentiment shared by many observers.",
      "Frank Lowenstein, former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama, told NBC News that passing the resolution was \"essential\" for Trump's proposal.",
      "\"There was no way this Trump plan could possibly work without a U.N. Security Council resolution,\" he said. Not only will it impart \"the credibility and the legitimacy and the clear support of the international community,\" but it also \"provides an opportunity to begin creating a new reality, to begin moving forward with the process in a way that will give people hope.\"",
      "He cautioned, however, that the resolution's passage was \"nowhere near sufficient,\" principally because the U.N. has no enforcement mechanism, and that Hamas immediately rejected the ISF.",
      "The resolution claims \"the parties\" to the conflict \"have accepted it.\" But it's not clear that is the case.",
      "The main Palestinian governmental body, the Palestinian Authority, said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomed the resolution and expressed its \"full readiness to cooperate\" with the United States and its backers.",
      "But Hamas, the perpetrators of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, said the agreement did not meet the \"political and humanitarian demands and rights\" of the Palestinian people.",
      "The Palestinian militant-political group, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and would be disarmed under the deal, said in a statement that the mandate the resolution grants to the ISF to use force \u201cstrips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.\u201d",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House for a response to those criticisms.",
      "Netanyahu praised Trump and \"his tireless and devoted team,\" saying he believed the plan \"will lead to peace and prosperity because it insists upon full demilitarization, disarmament and the deradicalization of Gaza.\"",
      "But just a day earlier, he had firmly rejected the resolution\u2019s call for \u201ca pathway towards Palestinian self-determination and eventual statehood,\u201d under pressure from his far-right coalition partners.",
      "Even putting those differences to one side, there are big question marks about how the basics of this plan will work in practice.",
      "\u201cThere is a genuine sense of relief that we are moving forward to diplomacy,\u201d said Nimrod Goren, the president of the Mitvim Institute, a progressive Israeli think tank.",
      "\u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s not really clear where all this is headed,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is the commitment of the leaders, the motivations of those behind it? And can it actually lead us away from the status quo in which Hamas still controls part of Gaza and Israel controls other parts around it?\u201d",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Trump said members of the Board of Peace would be named in the coming weeks \u2014 having previously said British Prime Minister Tony Blair would be involved \u2014 and to expect \"many more exciting announcements.\"",
      "Goren said: \"There are all kinds of new terminology and mechanisms that do not yet exist. So there are a lot of question marks on the basic premises: What is their mandate? How will they be set up?\"",
      "Indonesia, one of the backers of the U.S. proposal, says it is readying 20,000 troops to deploy to the ISF. But they are unlikely to head into Gaza so long as Hamas opposes the deal, Lowenstein said.",
      "\"Nobody's going to send troops to be a part of the stabilization force that's going to be fighting Hamas,\" he said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan was passed by a majority vote at the United Nations on Monday, though world powers were still divided over whether it can convert a fragile ceasefire into the long-term solution that has eluded the Middle East.",
      "Much about the plan remains uncertain, with occasional outbreaks of violence between Israel and Hamas threatening the tenuous diplomacy at every turn and Palestinians inside Gaza suffering hunger and now flooding at the onset of a bitter winter.",
      "The fraught path was made clear even before the delegates took to their desks, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 under pressure from his far-right coalition partners \u2014 denouncing the resolution's outlining of a future Palestinian state. Hamas also warned against the U.S. proposal.",
      "The Security Council adopted the plan with 13 votes in favor, zero votes against and two abstentions, Russia and China.",
      "\"Today\u2019s resolution represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper, and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security,\" Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the vote.",

Alongside that, an International Stabilization Force, known as the ISF, would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "The proposal would be \u201cphase two\u201d of Trump\u2019s 20-point plan first announced in September, \u201cphase one\u201d of which brought a prisoner and hostage exchange, as well as a ceasefire that has largely held despite accusations of violations from both sides.",

      "Some Security Council members objected that the U.S. resolution made no reference of Palestinian statehood, according to The Associated Press. The draft now says that after the Palestinian Authority has \u201cfaithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,\u201d the AP reported.",
      "The resolution supporting the U.S. plan is backed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other Arab states, as well as Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan. Of those, the only ones on the Security Council are the United States and Pakistan, a nonpermanent member, which therefore does not have a veto.",
      "A joint statement from the United States and its backers said the \u201cprocess offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\u201d and \u201cprovides a viable path towards peace and stability, not only between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but for the entire region.\u201d",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, lauded Trump for having \u201cassembled the Arab leaders and got them all to sign on the historic agreement.\u201d On Palestinian statehood, he issued a caveat that \u201cthe resolution does not call for the state, but it does say that it lays the groundwork, providing that there are reforms that have been called for for a long time.\u201d",
      "Even so, the open door to Palestinian statehood within the resolution has angered the Israeli far right, whose leading politicians are propping up Netanyahu\u2019s government. Under pressure from them, Netanyahu came out Sunday saying that \u201cour opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed.\u201d",
      "He said at a meeting: \u201cGaza will be demobilized and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way. I don\u2019t need reinforcements and tweets and lectures from anyone.\u201d",
