      "When Michael Cera was announced as joining the cast of a Wes Anderson movie for the first time, the prevailing response was: Hadn\u2019t he already been in a Wes Anderson movie",
      "CANNES, France -- When Michael Cera was announced as joining the cast of a Wes Anderson movie for the first time, the prevailing response was: Hadn\u2019t he already been in a Wes Anderson movie?",
      "So seemingly aligned in sensibility and style are Cera and Anderson that you could easily imagine a whole fake filmography. It is, for a slightly more corduroyed corner of the movie world, an actor-director pairing as destined as Scorsese and De Niro \u2014 even if \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is (checks notes one last time) their first movie together.",
      "\u201cI would remember,\u201d Cera deadpans. \u201cI would never have passed up the opportunity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d which Focus Features releases Friday in theaters, stars Benicio Del Toro as the international tycoon Zsa-zsa Korda, who after a lifetime of swindling and exploiting has decided to make his daughter, a novitiate named Liesl (Mia Threapleton), the heir to his estate.",
      "Cera plays Liesl\u2019s Norwegian tutor Bj\u00f8rn Lund. And because of the strong leading performances, you couldn\u2019t quite say Cera steals the show, he\u2019s certainly one of the very best things about \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\" \u2014 and that's something for a movie that includes Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston playing a game of HORSE. Bj\u00f8rn is an entomologist, which means Cera spends a sizable portion of the movie in a bow tie with an insect gently poised on his finger.",
      "\u201cHe is sort of a bug, himself,\u201d Cera, speaking in an interview at the Cannes Film Festival shortly before the premiere of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d says with a wry smile. \u201cAnd he sheds his skin and becomes his truth self.\u201d",
      "If Cera\u2019s role in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d feels like a long time coming, it is. He and Anderson first met more than 15 years ago. Cera, 36, was then coming off his early breakthroughs in \u201cArrested Development,\u201d \u201cSuperbad\u201d and \u201cJuno.\u201d A comic wunderkind from Ontario who stood out even among the \u201cArrested Development\u201d cast as a teenager, Cera had caught Anderson\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cIt was something arranged by an agent in New York and we went to a kind of cocktail party,\u201d Anderson recalls by phone. \u201cWe were with Harvey Keitel, too. So it was me and Harvey and Michael Cera \u2014 a totally unexpected combination. But I loved him. For years I\u2019ve kind of felt like: Why haven\u2019t we already done something together?\u201d",
      "For Cera, the meeting was even more memorable.",
      "\u201cI remember being very excited to meet him,\" Cera says. \"I remember him being very disarming. Obviously, he was like a luminary inspiration. He has had a huge impact on my general sense of taste. I discovered his movies when I was a teenager and watched them over and over.\u201d",
      "They nearly did come together on a movie before \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d Anderson had a small role for Cera in \u201cAsteroid City,\u201d but when its production schedule got pushed, Cera had to drop out because of the coming due date for his first son with his wife Nadine.",
      "\u201cI was kind of worried that I blew it,\" says Cera, \u201cthat I missed the chance to sneak in.\u201d",
      "But even though Anderson and Cera didn\u2019t work together until \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d they developed a relationship. Cera, who aspires to write and direct his own films, would send Anderson scripts for feedback. \u201cWe became friends,\u201d says Cera.",
      "\u201cIn the case of this movie, it was everything short of written for him,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cAs soon as we had the idea of the character, he was the guy who (cowriter Roman Coppola) and I started talking about. I think we talked to him about it before there was a script or anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt seemed like it had already happened,\u201d adds Anderson. \u201cAnd it was a very good fit, a natural thing.\u201d",
      "Cera quickly adapted to Anderson\u2019s unique style of moviemaking, in which the cast collectively stay at a hotel, begin the morning in makeup together and remain on set without trailers to retreat to. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re kind of exhausted,\u201d says Cera. \u201cAt the end of the first day, you go: OK, I need to eat a bigger breakfast.\u201d As the production went along, Cera often sat right next to Anderson to watch him work.",
      "One very notable characteristic of Bj\u00f8rn is a Norwegian accent. If there\u2019s anything more fitting than Michael Cera being a Wes Anderson movie, it might be Michael Cera doing a Norwegian accent in a Wes Anderson movie. It\u2019s also a bit that, in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d has a touch of spoiler to it. Cera calls it \u201csort of a jaunty, playful representation of an accent, not purporting to be a home run.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I brought up the accent to Wes, I said, \u2018How should we go about this accent?\u2019\u201d Cera say. \u201cHe was kind of caught of guard. I think he hears the movie in his head and maybe hadn\u2019t figured that in. It was something Wes had to compute.\u201d",
      "As Anderson describes it, Cera was determined. \u201cI, at a certain point, was a little reluctant, like, I don\u2019t know if we need it,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cHe was like: \u2018No, let me show you what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\u201d",
      "A determination in absurdism has long marked Cera's best performances. Though a private person who has resisted all urges to get a smartphone, Cera is remarkably fearless when it comes to the most awkward moments. It\u2019s a seriousness of purpose that, whether singing \u201cThese Eyes\u201d in \u201cSuperbad\u201d or waving hello as Allen in \u201cBarbie,\u201d that's made Cera a favorite of successive generations. Even in a billion-dollar blockbuster, Cera can be unassumingly hilarious.",
      "\u201cI feel like most people don\u2019t know I\u2019m in that movie. I mean, not a in a bad way. It was great for my personal disposition to get to be part of it,\u201d Cera says. \u201cI can say I\u2019m in it, but I can walk around. I\u2019m nowhere near the center of the movie. I\u2019m not on the poster, put it that way. (Laughs) My nephew went and saw the movie with my sister. Afterwards he was like, \u2018I thought Uncle Michael was going to be in this movie.\u2019 It was a nice lane for me.\u201d",
      "Just before the premiere of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d in Cannes, it was announced that Cera, after writing a handful of scripts including an adaptation of Charles Portis\u2019 \u201cMasters of Atlantis,\u201d will make his directorial debut with \u201cLove Is Not the Answer,\u201d a film he wrote that has a cast including Pamela Anderson and Steve Coogan.",
      "\u201cYou have a little more control over your destiny if you try to create something, even though it\u2019s hard to get it off the ground,\u201d Cera says. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than sitting around. You\u2019re like a hired contractor as an actor, and it\u2019s a great thing about it. But I think a lot of actors end up becoming frustrated directors because of how many opinions you have about the proceedings.\u201d",
      "It may have taken many years for Cera and Anderson to finally team up, but it could have come at the right time, just as Cera is \u2014 ahem \u2014 shedding a skin. In any case, theirs remains an ongoing collaboration. Anderson tapped Cera for an ad they recently shot for Mont Blanc. Does that mean he's officially part of the troupe?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s up to him,\" says Cera. \u201cI would never say no.\u201d",

      "Dolly Parton says her faith has carried her through her fluctuating grief following the death of her husband, Carl Dean",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Dolly Parton\u2019s angelic voice floated throughout her first gospel album in 1971 with songs like \u201cI Believe,\u201d \u201cLord Hold My Hand\u201d and the album\u2019s title track, \u201cGolden Streets of Glory.\u201d The entertainment icon says the same steadfast faith that inspired those hymns have anchored her throughout her grief following the death her husband, Carl Dean.",
      "\u201cI am a person of faith, and I truly believe that I\u2019m going to see him again someday. And I see him every day in my memories and in my heart, and in all the things that we used to do and all the things that we\u2019ve built together,\u201d said Parton. \u201cYou just kind of have to learn to kind of make new plans \u2014 but that\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honoree reflected on her marriage of nearly 60 years while promoting her new single-serve Southern-inspired frozen meals, following her popular Duncan Hines baking mixes via a collaboration with US-based Conagra Brands. Dean, who avoided the spotlight and inspired her timeless hit \u201cJolene,\u201d as well as her 2023 \u201cRockstar\u201d album, died in March at 82.",
      "\u201cI really feel his presence,\u201d said the 10-time Grammy winner. \u201cI just try to go on, because I know I have to. And he was ill for quite a while, and part of me was at peace that he was at peace and not suffering anymore. But that still doesn\u2019t make up for the loss and the loneliness of it.\u201d",
      "The 79-year-old recording artist spoke with The Associated Press about her perspective on life without her husband, her entrepreneurial spirit and on why she\u2019s never embraced the title \u201csuperstar.\u201d The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.",
      "PARTON: No, I just think that I\u2019ve always had dreams and I\u2019m always working. My husband understood that. Carl knew that better than anybody and he was all about it. He was very proud of me. \u2026 So when I did lose him, I just thought, well, I\u2019m going to take all of that energy, and I'm just going to put that back into other things, and I\u2019ll keep him ever-present in everything that I do.",
      "PARTON: I just think that if you\u2019re successful, if you are lucky enough to see your dreams come true, you need to make new dreams out of your other dreams. Because it\u2019s like a tree with lots of limbs and leaves, so every dream, you can kind of branch off \u2014 if you\u2019ll pardon the expression \u2014 and do other things. And I like the business end of things. I like seeing things happen, and I love making things happen. So, my mind just naturally works that way.",
      "PARTON: I have a new book coming out ... this one is called \u2018Star of the Show,\u2019 which is actually a song I wrote years ago. But it\u2019s about my life on the road and my life on stage \u2014 all the behind the scenes and all the people that I\u2019ve met, and all of the things that happen when you\u2019re traveling like that as I have for all of these years. So, that, and then I have my life story as a musical. It\u2019s called \u2018Dolly: An Original Musical.\u2019 And I\u2019ve written a lot of original songs for it. Of course, it\u2019ll have the big hits that are woven into the story. And it\u2019s just about my life, from the time I was little until up through now.",
      "It\u2019s going to be at the Fisher Center of Performing Arts at Belmont University (in Nashville). Then, once that has its run through the end of August, then we take it to New York to open on Broadway next year.",
      "PARTON: One of the things they did for the 40th anniversary was put a big sign up on the hill there above Dollywood that says \u201cDollywood\u201d like the Hollywood sign. \u2026 Years ago, when I thought, \u2018Well, someday I\u2019m going to have my own theme park and I\u2019m gonna change that H to a D and have Dollywood.' So, they finally, after 40 years, put that sign up, even though I\u2019ve talked about it for years. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of wonderful things planned for the whole season that\u2019s celebrating the 40th anniversary. It seems just like a few years back, but it\u2019s like everything else: I was with Carl for 60 years, and Dollywood\u2019s 40 years old. And that\u2019s just hard to believe because I\u2019m only 27. (laughs)",
      "PARTON: I don\u2019t think about my life in terms of \u2018superstar.\u2019 I\u2019m just a workin\u2019 girl. I always say \u2014 and it\u2019s the truth \u2014 that I am a workhorse that looks like a show horse. But I gotta keep it all up and I enjoy all of it. \u2026 My husband always said, \u2018If anybody was ever born to be a star, it\u2019s you.\u2019 Because he sees me loving to do all the things and playing and stuff \u2014 it\u2019s play time for me. But I take it very serious.",

      "Mr. Miyagi was known for waxing poetic",
      "Mr. Miyagi was known for waxing poetic. So the fact that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d has nothing to say is all the more disappointing.",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the original \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d and its early sequels is Mr. Miyagi\u2019s radical proclivity for mercy, often mistaken for cowardice by those around him. He doesn\u2019t just teach Daniel (Ralph Macchio) how to fight. He teaches him a subversive way of living, and, in doing so, becomes a kind of father figure to the fatherless boy.",
      "As is often the case, it seems the spirit of the franchise was lost somewhere in the creation of an entire universe \u2014 including six films and six seasons of \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d Although \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d does eventually allude to this philosophy of compassion, it lacks both the heart and grit of those earlier films. It\u2019s neither entertaining, nor thought-provoking, which makes one wonder whether this was solely a means of capitalizing on the renewed audience the franchise boasts thanks to \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the film follows the playbook of its predecessors. Li Fong (Ben Wang) moves to New York from Beijing with his mother and deals with the clashing of cultures and the struggles of being an outsider. And while Li does eventually, like in previous films, fight the jealous ex-boyfriend of his new romantic interest, their rivalry is hardly the focal point of the story.",
      "Instead, Li\u2019s main struggle is internal, as he deals with the grief of witnessing his brother get fatally stabbed by a disgruntled opponent after a kung fu match back home. But even that internal struggle is buried under other subplots and is hardly dealt with in the end.",
      "You might be wondering how Macchio and Jackie Chan fit into this story. They are, after all, on the movie poster. But neither is meaningfully in the film until about an hour into it, when they decide they need to help Li prepare for his karate match. Chan starred as a kung fu master in the 2010 remake, and the impressively choreographed fight scenes in this movie are more akin to his previous film \u2014 the convergence between Macchio's karate and Chan's kung fu is never really fleshed out.",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is the first project in the franchise to connect Chan and Macchio, and does so in a way that feels forced. Once Chan and Macchio are finally on screen, there are a few endearing moments between the pair. But not enough to save the film. The attempt to tell a different story, while laudable, turns the film into a convoluted one, with no real character development or stakes.",
      "Part of the problem is that the movie takes itself so seriously, making some of the irreverent humor of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d unattainable. (One of the best moments of the film is William Zabka\u2019s cameo as Johnny Lawrence in a light-hearted coda.) For the most part, the film struggles tonally, thanks in part to the upbeat music set against a backdrop of violence and trauma.",
      "That\u2019s not to say the previous films haven\u2019t always suffered from trying to do too many things. But there were moments of poignancy in the earlier movies that are absent in this latest installment of the franchise.",
      "Despite its sprawling universe, there's no need to have kept up with it to understand most of what's going on. But rewatching the first wouldn't hurt, even if it will make you nostalgic for what's missing in \u201cKarate Kid: Legends.\u201d",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for martial arts violence and some language. Running time: 94 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cMusic will return to the beaches,\u201d said Julio Trindade, who works as a DJ in the kiosks and campaigned against the measure. \u201c Rio\u2019s beaches are known worldwide and they deserve a soundtrack.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t respect the rules will face a fine of 1,000 reais (around $180) for the first infraction, a fine of 2,000 reais for the second. And on the third, we\u2019ll cancel the license and change the owner of the kiosk,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The United Street Vendors\u2019 Movement, which protested Tuesday in the municipal assembly, later said it met with assembly president Carlos Caiado.",
      "\u201cWe secured a crucial step forward: the creation of a working group with the participation of street vendor representatives to discuss safety, sanitary regulations and most importantly, the legalization of our category,\u201d the movement said.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran has summoned France's representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression.\u201d",
      "Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had praised \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d after it won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. The Iranian film centers on a man who abducts his suspected captor after being tortured in prison.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the French charge d\u2019affaires was summoned over the minister\u2019s \u201cinterventionist, irresponsible and instigative allegations,\u201d the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "\u201cSpare us Iranians the lectures. You have no moral authority whatsoever,\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on \u201cX,\u201d citing France's approach to Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. France last week threatened \u201cconcrete action\u201d against Israel if the country didn't halt the offensive in Gaza and lift restrictions on humanitarian aid, but the statement was mostly dismissed as empty threats.",
      "Immediately following the award's announcement, the Iranian state news agency had announced a more muted celebration of the award, crediting the country\u2019s film industry for winning a second Palme d\u2019Or after Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s 1997 drama, \u201cTaste of Cherry.\"",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won\u2019t allow him to make the films he wants to, and \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was filmed without cooperation. Iranian state TV called the film a mixture of \u201clie and smearing\u201d as well as an \u201cunderground\u201d film produced without required permits in Iran. State TV also chastised Panahi for not mentioning the plight of the Palestinians in his acceptance speech.",
      "The film follows a man named Vahid, played by Vahid Mobasser, who believes he sees his former captor, who tortured him in prison and ruined his life. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In a strange and emotional journey, they are all forced to grapple with revenge and forgiveness. Panahi drew on the experiences from his own imprisonment as well as the stories of detainees around him.",
      "Other state media were more critical of the win. The Mizan news agency, an arm of the country\u2019s judiciary, reported on the win as part of the \u201cPolitical Cannes Film Festival,\u201d suggesting that the prize was given to Panahi because of his political leanings.",
      "Pro-reform media outlets and activists praised Panahi. \u201cThis victory is no accident \u2014 it is the result of a tireless dedication to exploring humanistic values and human rights,\u201d said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who was also previously imprisoned at Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison. Inmates at the prison include those with Western ties and political prisoners.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in anti-government protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "Panahi was arrested in 2022 when he went to the Tehran prosecutor\u2019s office to inquire about the arrests of two other Iranian filmmakers. A judge later ruled that he must serve six years for an earlier sentence on charges of propagandizing against the government from 2011 that had never been enforced. In early 2023, Panahi went on a hunger strike and was released from Evin Prison.",
      "Panahi said he would not seek asylum in another country, despite the risks of additional imprisonment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he said last week from the Cannes festival. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "King Charles III arrives in Ottawa on Monday to underscore Canada\u2019s sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- King Charles III arrives in Ottawa this week to underscore Canada's sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne that will outline his government's agenda for the new Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cHis Majesty King Charles III will read the speech from the throne and thus present the plan of our government, our priorities, as Canada is facing a pivotal moment in its history, the biggest transformation of the global trading system since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" Carney told his caucus Sunday.",
      "Carney said \u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in the sovereign\" when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe are different and the king illustrates that,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cIf you look at why King Charles is reading the speech from the throne than you have to then acknowledge Canada\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn\u2019t necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that if there\u2019s a message to be sent there\u2019s easier ways to do that like calling him or calling the president.",
      "Royal historian Carolyn Harris expects Trump to notice the visit because the president has repeatedly spoken about his admiration for the royal family.",
      "Harris said Trump might see how different Canada is from the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt is a very distinctive history that goes back to the waves of loyalists who settled here after the American revolution,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to seeing the king in a Canadian context, escorted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, surrounded by Canadian symbolism. This is very much King Charles III in his role as King of Canada.\u201d",
      "The speech, which will be delivered Tuesday, is not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state. The king will read what is put before him by Canada\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCharles can only act with the consent and with the advice of his prime minister. But at the same time he cannot act in a way that would throw any of the other 14 Commonwealth realms under the bus. So it is finest tightrope to walk,\" said Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian.",
      "Canadians were not happy when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended a state visit invitation to Trump on behalf of the king during a time when Trump threatened Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\u201cTo be frank,\u201d Carney told Britain's Sky News. \u201cThey weren\u2019t impressed by that gesture, quite simply, given the circumstance. It was a time when we were quite clear ... about the issues around sovereignty.\"",
      "The king has more recently been showing support for Canada, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a British aircraft carrier.",
      "After he arrives on Monday he will drop the ceremonial first puck or ball during a street hockey game. He will also attend a community event and meet with Carney and Canada's governor general, his representative as head of state. The king will return to the U.K. after Tuesday's speech and a visit to Canada's National War Memorial.",

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 in Cannes held up Panahi's name to honor the director when he was under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\u201cLet us join forces,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cNo one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\u201d",
      "The win for \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d extended an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d'Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cTitane,\u201d \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d and \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cAnora,\u201d won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike his friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was inspired by Panahi's experience in prison. In the film, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "Panahi was jailed in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison after going there to inquire about the then-jailed Rasoulof. Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.",
      "In 2009, he was banned from traveling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continued to make films illegally in Iran, without a permit, and had his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.",
      "\u201cThe film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\u201d Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \u201cArt will always win. What is human will always win.\u201d",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "\u201cA day without electricity,\" sighed John C. Reilly, who sang an English-language \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d at the ceremony. The festival's films, he said, supplied \u201call the needed electricity.\"",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier\u2019s Norwegian family drama \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d his lauded follow-up to \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Some had expected \u201cSentimental Value\u201d to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\u201cWe live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\u201d",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s Brazilian political thriller \u201cThe Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \u201cThat was our wish.\u201d",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \u201cshow that our country\u2019s cinema is second to none.\u201d",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe\u2019s desert road trip \u201cSir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \u201cThe Little Sister,\u201d Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \u201cYoung Mothers.\u201d Its their ninth prize in Cannes. The festival's award for best first film, the Camera d'Or, went to Hasan Hadi for \u201cThe President's Cake,\u201d making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "Saturday's ceremony brought to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \u201cCan you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn\u2019t ship that way,\u201d said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d at the festival.

      "Other top American films in Cannes included Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d (which pulled Lee away from his New York Knicks but not out of their blue and orange color), the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning,\" and Ari Aster's \u201cEddington,\u201d which found a divisive reaction.",
      "Panahi's win put him in rare company. He's now won Cannes' Palme d'Or, Venice's Golden Lion (for \u201cThe Circle\u201d) and Berlin's Golden Bear (for \u201cTaxi\u201d). Only three other filmmakers have done that: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman.",
      "Addressing reporters after his win, Panahi spoke about filmmakers and artists always being able to find a way, \u201ceven in complicated situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey must realize that no powers that be can halt such people in their tracks,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cYou have this power.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Matt Wolf learned that Paul Reubens had died along with the rest of the world",
      "Paul Reubens did not tell his director that he was dying.",
      "On July 31, 2023, the news of Reubens' death came as a shock to documentary filmmaker Matt Wolf, who had spent a year trying to convince him to make the ambitious two-part documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max, and over 40 hours interviewing him on camera.",
      "But in 2023, the project was in danger of falling apart: The two had been at an impasse for a while over the issue of creative control and they\u2019d finally found a way forward. He had one last interview scheduled, set for the first week of August. Then the texts started coming in. Wolf sat there shaking.",
      "They\u2019d spoken about everything \u2014 Reubens' childhood, his complicated relationship with fame, his ambitions, his commitment to his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman, his sexuality, his arrest \u2014 except the fact that he\u2019d been battling cancer for the past six years. But after the initial shock, a renewed purpose set in.",
      "\u201cI went to work the day after Paul died. I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview through the night and was struck by the significance and meaning that came by understanding that he was privately contemplating mortality,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was aware that this was an extraordinary situation that was part of the story of the film and that the stakes were the highest I had ever experienced.\u201d",
      "For the next year, Wolf would wake up and say to himself, \u201cYou cannot drop the ball. Rise to the occasion.\u201d It was, he said, \u201cthe most challenging and involved and emotional process of filmmaking that I\u2019ve ever gone through and maybe that I\u2019ll ever go through again.\u201d",
      "Reubens wanted to direct his own documentary. He\u2019d always prized creative control and couldn\u2019t fathom why he would cede it in telling his own story for the first time. But everyone around him seemed to think that was a bad idea. It would take over a year of getting to know Wolf, whose film credits include documentaries about cellist Arthur Russell and news archivist Marion Stokes, to consider letting go.",
      "Even after Reubens had agreed to let Wolf direct the project, he continued to push back and resist at times. Early on, they decided to record their phone conversations as well, recognizing that their dynamic illuminated something true about Reubens.",
      "\u201cRight away, Paul was sort of rebelling against the process, blowing off steam, procrastinating, teasing me, sometimes being adversarial, but in a funny wink-wink way,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was frustrated. I thought, how am I ever going to get through this? This is the most resistant interview subject I\u2019ve ever encountered. Then I realized this is actually a pretty significant form of portraiture. This is showing Paul\u2019s discomfort and uncertainty about really showing and sharing himself.\u201d",
      "The result is a collaboration, Wolf said, but one in which he also had editorial control. It wasn\u2019t going to be a hit piece, but it wasn\u2019t going to be a puff piece either.",
      "Wolf, 43, was part of the generation of kids who grew up with the children\u2019s television series \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was, he said, the first time he\u2019d felt viscerally moved by a work of art.",
      "Still, he wasn\u2019t approaching the project as a fan. He was coming as a filmmaker who makes documentaries about gay artists and unconventional visionaries who \u201cbeg for reappraisal.\u201d Unlike most of his subjects, however, Reubens was an icon and a cult figure.",
      "\u201cI was determined not to make a film that fell into the traps of the celebrity biopic with platitudes from other famous people and manufactured self-reflection,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI wanted to make portrait of an artist.\u201d",
      "Much of the film focuses on the prehistory of Pee-wee, showing how his childhood, his artistic awakening, his early improv days and his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d rejection would converge into the commitment to this alter ego. Part of that involved engaging with Reubens\u2019 sexuality in a direct way. In the film, Reubens speaks about living openly as a gay man, and then going back in the closet.",
      "\u201cHe had always intended to come out but was very ambivalent about that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I saw myself as a younger gay person who could help somebody achieve that and also to give a sense of nuance and depth to his artistry that one could appreciate, and to understand the personal sacrifices that were required for him to do that.\u201d",
      "Reubens\u2019 career was derailed when he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in 1991. He was handed a small fine but the damage was incalculable. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography, which was reduced to an obscenity charge with probation. These are covered in the documentary\u2019s second part.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to set the record straight, particularly about the unfortunate footnotes of his arrest, which to some extent have overshadowed his artistic accomplishments,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat to me felt like the easy part and also the least interesting part of the film.\u201d",
      "\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, where Wolf got to see emotional responses from audiences, no matter if they came to it as fans or out of some curiosity around the controversies. That emotional intensity was what he hoped they\u2019d feel.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film with a big range of emotions, from joy and delight to tragedy and sorrow,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cPaul contains that big spectrum of feelings. And I wanted the viewer to feel it, to have a lasting connection to him. When a film can affect you emotionally it becomes unforgettable.\u201d",

      "The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars: Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and relative newcomer Harris Dickinson.",
      "Their films are very different but the fulfillment of longtime dreams of being behind the camera. All three movies are part of Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, which has helped launch the careers of directors like Yorgos Lanthimos, Lynne Ramsay and Molly Manning Walker.",
      "At 28, Dickinson is an up-and-coming actor, known for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d and the Palme d'Or-winning \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d who worked for years to develop his film, \u201cUrchin.\u201d",
      "Johansson, a two-time Oscar acting nominee who's been a star since her teens and played Black Widow in multiple Marvel films, brought \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a film about a nonagenarian who coopts her late friend's Holocaust story, to Cannes this week.",
      "Stewart, also an acting Oscar nominee, debuted \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, last week.",
      "Awards for the Un Certain Regard section will be announced Friday, a day before the Cannes Film Festival closes.",
      "Here's what the actors-turned-directors had to say about their first forays into creating a film from behind the camera.",
      "\u201cI wanted to direct from a very young age. I wanted to make films,\u201d says Dickinson, who got his start as many young creators do now: on YouTube. He even had a web sketch series. \u201cThat was my first love, just making things.\u201d",
      "Dickinson's profile as an actor has exploded in recent years, but his desire to direct was so strong, he started saying no to roles.",
      "\u201c'Urchin' was all I could think about. It was pouring out of me. It was all that was on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no when you\u2019ve got something to take you away from that, you know? Nothing that came in would make me question my own film, which is a sign that I had to make it at this time.\u201d",
      "The film stars Frank Dillane as a homeless Londoner suffering from drug addiction.",
      "Johansson is now one of the world's most recognizable stars. She's also one of its most respected, earning two Oscar nominations in 2020, for \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d",
      "Her success as an actor helped her take on new roles on films, including producing, and, now, directing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I worked enough that I stopped worrying about not working, or not being relevant \u2014 which is very liberating,\u201d Johansson says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something all actors feel for a long time until they don\u2019t. I would not have had the confidence to direct this film 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "She says that throughout her career, imagining how to make movies has been part of her process: \u201cWhether it was reading something and thinking, \u2018I can envision this in my mind,\u2019 or even being on a production and thinking, \u2018I am directing some elements of this out of necessity.\u2019\u201d",
      "The New York-set \u201cEleanor the Great\u201d stars June Squibb as a 94-year-old who, out of grief and loneliness, takes over her friend's story of Holocaust survival as her own.",
      "\u201cIt was eight years in the making and then a really accelerated push. It\u2019s an obvious comparison but it was childbirth,\u201d says Stewart of the film. \u201cI was pregnant for a really long time and then I was screaming bloody murder.\u201d",
      "Stewart in interviews has talked about challenging the myth that men are better suited to directing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair for people to think it\u2019s hard to make a movie insofar as you need to know things before going into it. There are technical directors, but, Jesus Christ, you hire a crew. You just have a perspective and trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy inexperience made this movie.\u201d",
      "Yuknavitch's memoir recounts her surviving sexual abuse by her father and how she sought refuge in competitive swimming and, later, writing.",
      "While Stewart expressed doubts that she offered much to her film's star, Imogen Poots, in terms of useful direction, the actor disagrees.",
      "\u201cKristen is incredibly present but at the same has this ability, like a plant or something, to pick up on a slight shift in the atmosphere where it\u2019s like: \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Poots said, causing Stewart to laugh. \u201cThere is this insane brain at play and it\u2019s a skill set that comes in the form of an intense curiosity.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, known for his award-winning images of nature and humanity, died at 81 from leukemia, his family said Friday. Local media reported he died in Paris, where he lived for more than 55 years.",
      "Salgado's style is marked by black-and-white imagery, rich tonality, and emotionally charged scenarios. Many of his best pictures were taken in impoverished communities, especially in the Amazon and in Africa. He was recently experiencing undisclosed health problems.",
      "\u201cThrough the lens of his camera, Sebasti\u00e3o tirelessly fought for a more just, humane, and ecological world,\u201d Salgado's family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs a photographer who traveled the globe continuously, he contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Genesis project. Fifteen years later, complications from this illness developed into severe leukemia, which ultimately took his life,\u201d the family added.",
      "Earlier, Instituto Terra, which was founded by Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado, and the French Academy of Fine Arts, of which he was a member, announced his death, but did not provide details on the circumstances or where he died.",
      "\u201cSebasti\u00e3o was more than one of the best photographers of our time,\u201d Instituto Terra said in a statement. \u201cHis lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, (brought) the power of transformative action.\u201d",
      "Composer Laurent Petitgirard, secretary of the French Academy of Fine Arts, said in a statement that Salgado, one of his colleagues, was \u201cremarkable for his moral integrity, his charisma, and his commitment to serving art.\u201d",
      "\"He leaves behind a monumental body of work,\u201d Petitgirard said about a photographer who received many awards, and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the United States in 1992 and to the French Academy of Fine Arts in 2016.",
      "Salgado\u2019s main works include the recent \u201cAmazonia\u201d series, \u201cWorkers,\u201d which shows manual labor around the world, and \u201cExodus\u201d (also known as \u201cMigrations\u201d or \u201cSahel\u201d), which documents people in transit, including refugees and slum residents.",
      "Salgado had his life and work portrayed in the documentary \u201cThe Salt of the Earth\u201d (2014), co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado. The film was was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2015.",
      "One of Brazil\u2019s most famous artists, though, always insisted he was \u201cjust a photographer.\u201d",
      "Salgado moved to France in 1969 as Brazil endured a military dictatorship. He said in different interviews he was then a leftist militant against the regime.",
      "It was in Paris in 1973 that he started to fully dedicate his time to photography and develop his black-and-white style, years after his economics degree.",
      "His first professional works were for the agency Sygma in 1974. The following year, he documented the lives of peasants and Indigenous peoples in Latin America for the Gamma agency. Five years later, he joined Magnum, a top brand for photographers, of which he later became president.",
      "Salgado left it in 1994 to found Amazonia Images with his wife, an agency that exclusively handles his work.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who received Salgado\u2019s support throughout his political career, requested a minute of silence during a ceremony in the capital city of Brasilia to honor \u201cone of the greatest, if not the greatest, photographer the world has ever produced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis nonconformity with the fact that the world is so unequal and his stubborn talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSalgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and his heart.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron posted a picture of Salgado\u2019s in Alaska in his Instagram profile as a tribute to the photographer, who also had French citizenship.",
      "Salgado and his wife, whom he married in 1967, raised their two sons, Juliano and Rodrigo, in France. His friends said every morning that he could he would breathe the air near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. His death also caused commotion in the country he adopted.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che, a major French composer who worked with Salgado for his exhibition \u201cAqua Mater\u201d in Paris, said the Brazilian was an \u201cauthentic and warm man\u201d.",
      "\u201cHis gaze transformed landscapes, and beyond the spectacular, he reached a kind of inner truth (\u2026). With him, photography fulfilled one of its highest ambitions by going far beyond mere appearances,\u201d M\u00e2che told The Associated Press.",
      "Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Salgado was passionate about their city.",
      "\u201cTonight I cry for a very close friend, a rare soul; a loyal, discreet and sensible man. His death moves us profoundly. He already leaves us an immense void,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cParis, the city that loved him, will give him the honors he deserves.\u201d",
      "An exhibition of about 400 of Salgado\u2019s works is currently on display in the city of Deauville, in northern France.",
      "Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.

He was scheduled to attend an exhibition with works by his son Rodrigo for a church in the same city on Saturday, the daily reported.",
      "Salgado and his wife had been working since the 1990s to restore part of the Atlantic Forest in Minas Gerais. In 1998, they turned a plot of land they owned into a nature reserve, according to Salgado\u2019s biography on the French Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 website. That same year, they created Instituto Terra, which promotes reforestation and environmental education.",
      "So far, Instituto Terra has planted more than 3 million trees in the city of Aimores, which lies in what was once a somewhat deserted region in the countryside of the Minas Gerais state. The photographer was born there in 1944.",
      "In an undated interview with Forbes Brasil published on Thursday, Salgado said that attending the exhibition of his works in Deuville felt like a stroll through his life.",
      "\u201cHow many times in my life have I put my camera to the side and sat down to cry? Sometimes it was too dramatic, and I was alone. That's the power of the photographer; to be able to be there,\u201d Salgado said.",
      "\u201cIf a photographer is not there, there's no image. We need to be there. We expose ourselves a lot. And that is why it is such an immense privilege.\u201d",

The \u201cPanthers on the Prowl\u201d initiative combines art and philanthropy to support cancer research and patient services, and donors get the chance to sponsor life-sized panther sculptures that will be placed around South Florida.",

      "\u201c'Panthers on the Prowl' is a creative and really cool and uplifting way to demonstrate and show our support for those people that are suffering, so we can generate the much-needed funding to keep this fight going,\" Buble said. \"Cancer touches all of us, my family, friends, yours, neighbors, everyone. I joined my buddy Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers and all of our NHL hockey community because I want to be part of the solution.\u201d",

      "King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States",
      "TORONTO -- King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne on Tuesday where he will lay out the Canadian government\u2019s agenda when Parliament reopens.",
      "The monarch is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in our sovereign,\" Carney said when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, only did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re different,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cWe are not the United States. It sounds simple, but that\u2019s what the visit says.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same institutions. We don\u2019t have the same history,\u201d Charest said. \"We are a different country with a different choice in terms of how how we built ourselves, and King Charles tells that story.\u201d",
      "This will be Charles' first visit as monarch. He visited Canada 19 times as prince. The king has been showing his support for Canada in recent months, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.",
      "Historian Robert Bothwell said that the king\u2019s speech in Parliament \u201cis a gesture of solidarity and identity that can be construed to be a gesture of support.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn't necessary.",
      "\u201cWe're thrilled that the king will be here. If there's a message in there, you know, there's easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. Carney can call the president at any time,\u201d Hoekstra told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cBut I know what the implication is. It's, oh about ... the 51st state, it's over. And, you know, move on.\u201d",
      "The speech sets the legislative agenda for a new session of Parliament. It's not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state.",
      "The king will read what is put before him by Canada's prime minister and his team. The speech is usually read by Canada's governor general, the monarch's representative in Canada. The governor general holds a constitutional but mostly ceremonial and symbolic position.",
      "\u201cKing Charles is unlikely to comment directly on the 51st state issue. Yet, his introductory remarks could feature broad statements about Canada\u2019s integrity and sovereignty. At least this is what many Canadians would like him to do,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Former Canadian prime ministers and governor generals will attend the speech. The king will then pay his respects at the National War Memorial before a Royal Canadian Air Force flyby.",
      "B\u00e9land said the monarchy has long been unpopular among Quebec\u2019s French-speaking majority, and some nationalist voices in the province have been critical of the Carney government\u2019s decision to invite the king to deliver the throne speech.",
      "\"Whether the separatists work themselves into a lather over this frankly, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think Quebecers will care a lot,\u201d said Charest, the former premier of Quebec. \u201cThe may not like the monarchy or whatever they\u2019d like to read into it, but British institutions have served us very well.\u201d",

      "It's been nearly a decade since robbers stormed Kim Kardashian\u2019s luxury residence and tied her up at gunpoint",
      "PARIS -- The Paris robbery of Kim Kardashian lasted only minutes \u2014 but its impact reverberated for nearly a decade.",
      "On Friday, a court in the French capital will decide the verdict in one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history \u2014 the night masked men stormed the star\u2019s luxury apartment, tied her up at gunpoint and vanished into the dark with $6 million in jewels.",
      "Nine men and a woman stand accused of carrying out or aiding the crime during the Paris Fashion Week in 2016, when the robbers, dressed as police, forced their way into the glamorous H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, bound her with zip ties and escaped with her jewelry \u2014 a theft that would force celebrities to rethink how they live and protect themselves.",
      "After delivering final statements in court, the defendants were dismissed Friday morning, with a verdict expected later in the day.",
      "Among them was 69-year-old Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the alleged ringleader, who arrived at court walking with a stick, his face hidden from cameras. Prosecutors have asked for a 10-year sentence. His DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Khedache says he was only a foot soldier. He blamed a mysterious \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 someone prosecutors say never existed.",
      "His lawyer pleaded for clemency, pointing to one of the trial\u2019s most visceral moments \u2014 Kardashian\u2019s earlier courtroom encounter with the man accused of orchestrating her ordeal. Though she wasn't present Friday, her words \u2014 and the memory of that moment \u2014 still echoed.",
      "\u201cShe looked at him when she came, she listened to the letter he had written to her, and then she forgave him,\u201d lawyer Franck Berton told The Associated Press.",
      "Kardashian, typically shielded by security and spectacle, had locked eyes with Khedache as the letter was read aloud.",
      "\u201cI do appreciate the letter, I forgive you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the feelings and the trauma and the fact that my life was forever changed.\u201d A tabloid crime had become something raw and human.",
      "Khedache on Friday asked for \u201ca thousand pardons,\u201d communicated via a written note in court. Other defendants also used their final words to express remorse.",
      "The accused became known in France as \u201cles papys braqueurs\u201d \u2014 the grandpa robbers. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. Some read the proceedings from a screen, hard of hearing and nearly mute. But prosecutors warned observers not to be seduced by soft appearances.",
      "The trial is being heard by a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will need a majority vote to reach a decision.",
      "The defendants face charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and gang association. If convicted, some of them could face life in prison.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony earlier this month was the emotional high point. In a packed courtroom, she recounted how she was thrown onto a bed, zip-tied, and had a gun pressed to her on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.\u201d",
      "She was dragged into a marble bathroom and told to stay silent. When the robbers fled, she freed herself by scraping the tape on her wrists off against the sink, then hid with her friend, shaking and barefoot.",
      "She said that Paris had once been her sanctuary \u2014 a city she would wander at 3 a.m., window shopping, stopping for hot chocolate. That illusion was shattered.",
      "The robbery echoed far beyond the City of Light. It forced a recalibration of celebrity behavior in the age of Instagram. For years, Kardashian had curated her life like a showroom: geo-tagged, diamond-lit, public by design. But this was the moment the showroom turned into a crime scene. In her words, \u201cPeople were watching \u2026 They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she stopped posting her location in real time. She stripped her social media feed of lavish gifts and vanished from Paris for years. Other stars followed suit. Privacy became luxury.",
      "Defense attorneys have asked the court for leniency, citing the defendants\u2019 age and health. But prosecutors insist that criminal experience, not frailty, defined the gang.",
      "Even by the standards of France\u2019s famously deliberate legal system, the case took years to reach trial.",
      "Kardashian, who once said that the experience \u201creally changed everything,\u201d now waits for a verdict \u2014 and perhaps, a final measure of closure.",

      "Dave Shapiro, a groundbreaking music executive in the heavy metal and hard rock scene, has died in a San Diego plane crash. He was 42.",
      "Shapiro had a pilot\u2019s license and was listed as the owner of the plane that crashed, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The music agency Sound Talent Group confirmed Shapiro died in the Thursday morning crash along with two employees.",
      "\"We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Shapiro cofounded Sound Talent Group in 2018 with Tim Borror and Matt Andersen. The agency\u2019s roster focuses on alternative bands across pop-punk, metalcore, post-hardcore and other popular hard rock subgenres. Clients have included Hanson, Pierce The Veil, Parkway Drive, Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton.",
      "Shapiro was a strong advocate for independent musicians and a co-founder of the National Independent Talent Organization. He was included in Billboard's 2012 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list recognizing rising stars in entertainment. Industry veterans say Shapiro paved the way for the formation of other independent agencies and helped many alternative bands find audiences in the mainstream.",
      "\u201cFinding something you love to do is only going to make you do a better job because you actually care. You\u2019re not just showing up for the paycheck, it\u2019s not a 9-to-5,\u201d he said in a music industry podcast in 2021. \u201cThis is part of living your life if you really love it.\u201d",
      "Shapiro grew up in upstate New York in the \u201cstraightedge hard-core\u201d scene, a subculture that promotes not using drugs and alcohol in reaction to mainstream punk.",
      "In high school, he started a band with his friends and got signed with Victory Records right when they graduated. They toured for a few years, during which he made connections in the music industry that would help his foray into the business side.",
      "Shapiro said he became instantly hooked on aviation after taking his first intro flight at age 22. He seemed to love music and flying with equal passion, at one point opening an office of his talent agency at a hangar in San Diego.",
      "Flying \u201chelps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever\u2019s going on outside the plane kind of doesn\u2019t matter in those moments,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview.",
      "Shapiro owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label, Velocity Records.",
      "He offered flights in both San Diego and Homer, Alaska, where he and his wife, Julia Pawlik Shapiro, owned a home, according to his online posts.",
      "Shapiro married his wife in 2016 in the small town of Talkeetna, Alaska. They picked up their wedding licenses, got on a plane and flew to a glacier inside Denali National Park, landing with skis strapped to the plane\u2019s wheels.",
      "\u201cWhen I met Dave, we became instantly bonded over the unconventional lifestyles we lead and our constant need for adventure,\u201d she wrote in a blog post.",
      "In 2019, he posted on Instagram that he had obtained his airline transport pilot rating, the highest level of certification issued by the U.S.",
      "\u201cAlthough I have a career and don\u2019t plan to change that I always want to learn more and be a better pilot,' he wrote. He was also an adrenaline junkie who enjoyed base-jumping.",
      "Tributes poured in Thursday from musicians and others in the industry who called him warm, genuine and someone who helped little-known bands put their names on the map.",
      "\u201cHe would listen to any band you put in front of him to give them a chance,\u201d said Dayna Ghiraldi-Travers, founder of public relations agency Big Picture Media, who worked with Shapiro for over 15 years.",
      "Nate Blasdell, former lead guitarist for the band I Set My Friends on Fire, said he was \u201cabsolutely heartbroken.\"",
      "\u201cDave was the first booking agent I ever worked with and he was a major part of my music career in my late teen years,\u201d he said in a post on the social platform X. \u201cHe was truly the best in the game and one of the most respected people in the industry.\u201d",
      "Sum 41 singer Deryck Whibley credits Shapiro to helping build the rock band back up during a \u201clow point\u201d in their career.",
      "\u201cHis opinion mattered so much to me,\u201d Whibley said. \u201cHe was that guy I would go to for advice on things.\u201d",

      "\u201cMe and my wife, we\u2019re going to fly to you,\" Whibley said Shapiro said to him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pick you up and we\u2019re going to go somewhere crazy for lunch.\u201d",

      "A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he has demanded a second opinion at a court hearing",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he demanded a second opinion at a Thursday court hearing.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle a 48-year-old from Mississippi, appeared while in custody behind glass at a Hollywood courthouse that specializes in mental health cases. He had a long, gray beard and wore a thick, blue smock that jails use for suicide prevention.",
      "A county-appointed psychiatrist who evaluated Carwyle found the defendant incompetent, Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge as he stood near his client with glass separating them. But Krauss said Carwyle, as is his right, would like an evaluation from a different psychiatrist.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Maria Cavaluzzi ordered the reevaluation and set another hearing for May 29.",
      "Krauss declined comment outside court, as did the prosecutor handling the case and an attorney observing the hearing on behalf of Aniston.",
      "Prosecutors allege Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism at his first court appearance, where a judge paused the criminal proceedings so he could undergo the psychological evaluation.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",
      "Carwyle also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. If convicted, he could get up to three years in prison. If Carwyle is found incompetent again, the judge could order him to be sent to a state mental hospital for treatment and ongoing evaluation.",
      "Other than asking for the protective order for Aniston, prosecutors have not given their position on Carwyle's competency status, and did not speak at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Aniston became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hasn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years",
      "CANNES, France -- Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hadn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "These and other films of Panahi\u2019s premiered to considerable acclaim at international film festivals where the director\u2019s conspicuous absence was sometimes noted by an empty chair. When his last film, 2022\u2019s \u201cNo Bears,\u201d debuted, he was in jail. Only after his hunger strike made worldwide news was Panahi \u2014 who had gone to Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison to inquire about his friend, the then-jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof \u2014 released, in early 2023.",
      "Two years later, with his travel ban finally lifted, Panahi arrived at the Cannes Film Festival with a film, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d riven with the fury and pain of incarceration by the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cBeing here does matter, of course. But what\u2019s even more important is that the film is here,\u201d Panahi said in an interview on a Palais terrace. \u201cEven when I went to jail, I was happy that the film was done. I didn\u2019t mind being in prison because my job was done.\u201d",
      "Yet Panahi\u2019s appearance in Cannes, where the film premiered Tuesday, carries tremendous meaning \u2014 and risk \u2014 for a filmmaker who has played such a massive role in international cinema in absentia. But for a director who has previously had his films smuggled out of Iran on USB drives, risk is a constant for Panahi.",
      "\u201cYes, this is an ongoing risk,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cNow it will probably be higher. But the Iran situation is unpredictable. It changes everyday. New politics everyday. So we have to see what happens the day we go back.\u201d",
      "Last year, in order to reach Cannes, Panahi\u2019s countryman Rasoulof crossed the Iranian border on foot before resettling in Germany. (His film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d was ultimately nominated for best international film at the Oscars.) Panahi says they speak every other day. After the premiere of \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Rasoulof texted Panahi to congratulate him on the moment.",
      "Unlike Rasoulof, though, Panahi \u2014 whose \u201cNo Bears\u201d captured him emotionally gazing across, but not crossing, the border \u2014 has no plans to flee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m flying back to Tehran on Sunday,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "What Panahi does have, as his latest film shows once again, is the ability to deftly lace complicated feelings of resistance, sorrow and hope into gripping movies of elegant, if heartbreaking, composition.",
      "In \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which is in competition for the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasser) believes he sees his former captor and torturer. Though blindfolded while imprisoned, Vahid recognizes the sound of the man's prosthetic leg. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In this strange odyssey, they are all forced to confront revenge or forgiveness for the man who ruined their lives. Panahi drew from his own imprisonment but also from the stories of detainees jailed alongside him.",
      "\u201cIt was the experience of all these people I met in prison, mixed with my own perception and experience,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cFor instance, the fact of never seeing the face of your interrogator is everyone\u2019s experience. But then the people who have spent over a decade in prison have more experience than myself, so I\u2019ve been very sensitive to their narratives.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d may be Panahi\u2019s most politically direct film yet. It\u2019s certainly his most anguished. That\u2019s a product of not just his personal experience in prison but of the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cI think ultimately violence will be inevitable. And it\u2019s exactly what the regime wants, because it gives a justification to the repression,\u201d says Panahi. \u201cThe longer they remain and the more pressure they put on the people, the more the people will feel that they have no other solution. And that\u2019s when it will get dangerous.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Panahi is without hope.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians\u2019 struggle and fight for freedom is extremely precious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat people are doing is so impressive. The regime is just trying to divide us. That\u2019s all they focus on now, to create division between the people.\u201d",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won't allow him to make the films he wants to. So committed is he to making film, he notes that the downside to being able to travel is that he might have to spend a year promoting his film, instead of making the next one. On Thursday, Neon acquired the North American distribution rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do. Maybe if I had other abilities, I would have changed to something else,\u201d Panahi says. \u201cWhen you know that\u2019s the only thing you can do, you find ways. Now, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It was harder at the beginning. There were less people doing underground films. We started this fashion, in a way, so there are ways we have learned and practiced, many of us.\u201d",
      "More than perhaps any filmmaker on earth, you can expect Panahi to find a way to keep making movies, no matter the circumstances.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he nods, \u201cat least.\u201d",

      "SAN DIEGO -- A private jet carrying a music talent agent and five others hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, slamming into a home and killing multiple people on the flight.",
      "With the home engulfed in flames and jet fuel rolling down the streets, half a dozen vehicles ignited while residents in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing were shaken awake just before 4 a.m. by the thunderous crash and subsequent explosions. Out their windows, they saw a wall of fire.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,\u201d San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.",
      "No one in the neighborhood died, but eight were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and injuries that were not life-threatening, including a person who was hurt climbing out a window, police officer Anthony Carrasco said.",
      "Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among those killed, the music agency said in a statement. Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and the Canadian rock group Sum 41. Hanson is perhaps best known for its earworm 1990s pop hit, \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Shapiro also owned Velocity Records.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Six people were on board the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities were still combing the scene and recovering the bodies before releasing an official number and identifying the dead, though there were not believed to be any survivors aboard the flight.",
      "Daniel Williams, former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, posted on his Instagram on Wednesday afternoon that he was boarding the plane with Shapiro. The band posted a tribute to Williams on their Instagram page.",

      "The home that was struck was destroyed, with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed, and about 10 others were damaged in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country, officials said.",
      "Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them.",
      "\u201cMy wife was screaming, and she\u2019s like, 'There's a fire,'\u201d McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV.",
      "When he walked toward the front of the house, he saw that the roof had fallen off and flames blocked their exit. They grabbed their children and dogs and ran to the back, where their neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape.",
      "The plane also hit both of the couple's vehicles, which burned.",
      "\u201cIt put my truck into our living room,\u201d McCarty said.",
      "Other vehicles along the block were melted and scorched into burned shells. One stubborn car fire sent smoke billowing up for hours.",
      "Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog.",
      "One of the family\u2019s cars was \u201ccompletely disintegrated,\u201d and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris.",
      "\u201cI definitely do feel blessed, because we\u2019ve been spared,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 100 residents were evacuated. Hours after the crash, jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street. The smell of fumes lingered throughout the day, and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.",
      "\u201cWe have jet fuel all over the place,\u201d Assistant San Diego Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy said.",
      "Eddy added that the fog was so thick in the morning that \u201cyou could barely see in front of you.\u201d",
      "The flight took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, near Manhattan, at about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before continuing on to San Diego, according to Simpson.",
      "Based on the flight path, it was bound for Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when it struck power lines about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of the airfield, Simpson said.",
      "Audio recorded by www.liveATC.net includes a brief transmission from the pilot saying he was on final approach to the airport and was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) out at 3:45 a.m.",
      "NTSB investigators planned to spend Thursday and Friday at the scene gathering evidence, Simpson said. He welcomed video or other details from any witnesses.",
      "At that hour and in foggy weather, the plane was likely operating on an instrument flight rules plan, which is typically used during reduced visibility, said Barry Newman, a board-certified aviation attorney.",
      "However, for that airport, once an aircraft reaches 673 feet (205 meters), the pilot also has to rely on sight.",
      "\u201cIf a pilot descends to that level and he can\u2019t see the runway, he has to call for a missed approach or divert to another airport,\u201d Newman said.",
      "In October 2021 a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes. It was preparing to land at the airport.",
      "And in December 2008, a Marine Corps fighter jet slammed into a house in San Diego\u2019s University City neighborhood, causing an explosion that killed four people inside. The Marine Corps blamed the crash on mechanical failure and human error.",

      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering day in early 1952 in Algiers",
      "PARIS -- Decades before transgender became a household word and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d became a worldwide hit \u2014 before visibility brought rights and recognition \u2014 there was Bambi, the Parisian icon who danced for Hollywood.",
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering summer day in early 1950s Algeria. An effeminate teenage boy named Jean-Pierre Pruvot stood mesmerized as traffic halted and crowds swarmed around a scandalous spectacle unfolding in the conservative Algiers streets.",
      "All had stopped to look at Coccinelle, the flamboyant \u201ctransvestite\u201d star of Paris\u2019 legendary cabaret, the Carrousel de Paris, who strutted defiantly down the boulevard, impeccably dressed as a woman, sparking awe and outrage and literally stopping traffic.",
      "What Pruvot \u2014 who would become famous under the female stage name \u201cBambi\u201d and Coccinelle\u2019s best friend \u2014 witnessed was more than mere performance. It was an act of resistance from the ashes of the Nazi persecution of the LGBTQ+ community in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that (identity) existed,\u201d Bambi told The Associated Press in a rare interview. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to do the same.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Carrousel troupe in the late 1940s emerged as a glamorous, audacious resistance. Bambi soon joined Coccinelle, April Ashley, and Capucine in Paris to revive queer visibility in Europe for the first time since the Nazis had violently destroyed Berlin\u2019s thriving queer scene of the 1930s.",
      "The Nazis branded gay men with pink triangles, deported and murdered thousands, erasing queer culture overnight. Just a few years after the war, Carrousel performers strode onto the global stage, a glittering frontline against lingering prejudice.",
      "Remarkably, audiences at the Carrousel knew exactly who these performers were \u2014 women who, as Bambi puts it, \u201cwould bare all.\u201d",
      "Elvis Presley, Ava Gardner, \u00c9dith Piaf, Maria Callas and Marlene Dietrich all flocked to the cabaret, drawn to the allure of performers labeled \u201ctravestis.\u201d The stars sought out the Carrousel to flirt with postwar Paris\u2019s wild side. It was an intoxicating contradiction: cross-dressing was criminalized, yet the venue was packed with celebrities.",
      "The history of queer liberation shifted in this cabaret, one sequin at a time. The contrast was chilling: as Bambi arrived in Paris and found fame dancing naked for film stars, across the English Channel in early 1950s Britain the code-breaking genius Alan Turing was chemically castrated for being gay, leading to his suicide.",
      "Today, Marie-Pierre Pruvot \u2014 as she is also known \u2014 lives alone in an unassuming apartment in northeastern Paris. Her bookshelves spill over with volumes of literature and philosophy. A black feather boa, a lone whisper from her glamorous past, hangs loosely over a chair.",
      "At nearly 90, Bambi is the last of a dying generation. She outlived all her Carrousel sisters \u2014 April Ashley, Capucine, and Coccinelle.",
      "And though the spotlight faded, the legacy still shimmers.",
      "In her heyday, Bambi wasn\u2019t just part of the show; she was the show \u2014 with expressive almond-shaped eyes, pear-shaped face, and beauty indistinguishable from any desired Parisienne. Yet one key difference set her apart \u2014 a difference criminalized by French law.",
      "The depth of her history only becomes apparent as she points to striking and glamorous photographs and recounts evenings spent with legends.",
      "Such was their then-fame that the name of Bambi\u2019s housemate, Coccinelle, became slang for \"trans\" in Israel \u2014 often cruelly.",
      "Once Dietrich, the starry queer icon, arrived at the tiny Madame Arthur cabaret alongside Jean Marais, the actor and Jean Cocteau 's gay lover. \u201cIt was packed,\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cJean Marais instantly said, \u2018Sit (me and Marlene) on stage' And so they were seated onstage, legs crossed, champagne by their side, watching us perform.\u201d",
      "Another day, Dietrich swept in to a hair salon.",
      "\u201cMarlene always had this distant, untouchable air \u2014 except when late for the hairdresser,\u201d Bambi says, smiling. \u201cShe rushed in, kissed the hairdresser, settled beneath the dryer, stretched her long legs imperiously onto a stool, and lit a cigarette. Her gaunt pout as she smoked \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says, her impression exaggerated as she sucked in her cheeks. Perhaps Dietrich wasn\u2019t her favorite star.",
      "Then there was Piaf, who, one evening, teasingly joked about her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the French singing legend Charles Aznavour, performing nearby. \u201cShe asked, \u2018What time does Aznavour start?\u2019\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Midnight.\u2019 So she joked, \u2018Then it\u2019ll be finished by five past midnight.\u2019\"",
      "Behind the glamour lay constant danger. Living openly as a woman was illegal. \u201cThere was a police decree,\u201d Bambi recalls. \u201cIt was a criminal offense for a man to dress as a woman. But if you wore pants and flat shoes, you weren\u2019t considered dressed as a woman.\u201d",
      "The injustice was global. Homosexuality remained criminalized for decades: in Britain until 1967, in parts of the U.S. until 2003. Progress came slowly.",
      "In 1950s Paris, though, Bambi bought hormones casually over-the-counter, \u201clike salt and pepper at the grocery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was much freer then,\u201d but stakes were high, she said.",
      "Sisters were jailed, raped, driven into sex work. One comrade died after botched gender reassignment surgery in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cThere was only Casablanca,\u201d she emphasized, with one doctor performing the high-risk surgeries. Bambi waited cautiously until her best friends, Coccinelle and April Ashley, had safely undergone procedures from the late 50s before doing the same herself.",
      "Each night required extraordinary courage. Post-war Paris was scarred, haunted. The Carrousel wasn\u2019t mere entertainment \u2014 but a one-fingered salute to the past in heels and eyeliner.",
      "\u201cThere was this after-the-war feeling \u2014 people wanted to have fun,\u201d Bambi recalled. With no television, the cabarets were packed every night. \u201cYou could feel it \u2014 people demanded to laugh, to enjoy themselves, to be happy. They wanted to live again \u2026 to forget the miseries of the war.\u201d",
      "In 1974, sensing a shift, Bambi quietly stepped away from celebrity, unwilling to become \u201can aging showgirl.\u201d Swiftly obtaining legal female identity in Algeria, she became a respected teacher and Sorbonne scholar, hiding her dazzling past beneath Marcel Proust and careful anonymity for decades.",
      "Despite what she\u2019s witnessed, or perhaps because of it, she\u2019s remarkably skeptical about recent controversies around gender. This transgender pioneer feels wokeism has moved too quickly, fueling a backlash.",
      "She sees U.S. President Donald Trump as part of \u201ca global reaction against wokeism\u2026 families aren\u2019t ready\u2026 we need to pause and breathe a little before moving forward again.\u201d",
      "Inclusive pronouns and language \u201ccomplicate the language,\u201d she insists. Asked about author J.K. Rowling\u2019s anti-trans stance, her response is calmly dismissive: \u201cHer opinion counts no more than a baker\u2019s or a cleaning lady\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Bambi still stands \u2014 proud, elegant, unbowed \u2014 in a life spanning World War II to \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d",
      "When she first stepped onstage, the world had no words for someone like her. So she danced anyway. Today, the words exist. So do the rights. And the movements she helped inspire.",
      "\u201cI never wore a mask,\u201d she says softly, but firmly. \u201cExcept when I was a boy.\u201d",

      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his status as a power broker to abuse women.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the 41-year-old Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi.",
      "The Cleveland born-and-raised, skinny-jean wearing, Grammy Award-winning rapper has long been celebrated for his alternative hip-hop, emotional music that effortlessly weaves genres together in surprising ways.",
      "Music blogs and other tastemakers quickly caught on to Cudi's 2007 single, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite,\u201d with its unique singsong style that later appeared on his blockbuster 2009 debut, \u201cMan on the Moon: The End of the Day\u201d as \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite (Nightmare).\" The album's hits included \u201cPursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)\u201d and is easily one of the most influential rap records of the last two decades. In September, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite\u201d was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.",
      "Cudi began as something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West, when the then-uncontroversial rapper signed Cudi to his G.O.O.D. Music label in 2008. Cudi left in 2013.",
      "He is featured on Jay-Z's \u201cThe Blueprint 3\u201d and West's landmark \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d Cudi has always had an eye and ear toward innovation. In 2022, his album \u201cEntergalactic\u201d was released alongside a Netflix adult-animated romantic comedy of the same name, which he told The Associated Press allowed him to \u201cexplore the abstract.\u201d",
      "Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, has been the trial\u2019s central witness with her accounts of years of violence and sexual abuse.",
      "She testified that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi in 2011 to work on music. The two began dating soon after, and she said she got a burner phone to communicate with Cudi in secret.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in sex parties that Combs orchestrated. It was during one of these that Combs looked at her phone and learned of the Cudi relationship, Cassie testified.",
      "In response, she said he lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country in 2012, Combs told her that Cudi\u2019s car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi\u2019s friends there to see it, Cassie testified.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie\u2019s mother, Regina Ventura, testified that Cassie told her Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother\u2019s Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and she broke up with him, fearing for both of their safety.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "His latest album, \u201cInsano,\u201d arrived last year. Soon after its release, \u201cInsano (Nitro Mega),\u201d a partner record that featured Wiz Khalifa, Pusha T, Steve Aoki and more, arrived.",
      "On May 9, Cudi released his latest single, \u201cNeverland.\u201d A short film of the same name, directed by Ti West and produced by Monkeypaw Productions, will premiere at Tribeca Film Festival this June.",
      "Also in May, Cudi officially launched his new apparel label, WZRD.",

      "A French court will deliver its verdict Wednesday in one of the country\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse cases, which has raised questions about how a pedophile surgeon was able to rape hundreds of victims over a period spanning more than two decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, a 74-year-old former surgeon, stands accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 children. On Friday, prosecutors requested the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, describing Le Scouarnec as \u201ca devil in a white coat.\u201d He's already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces.",
      "The new trial in Brittany, western France, began in February and has laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.",
      "During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.",
      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",

      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "A leading medical group is warning of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country",
      "CAIRO -- A leading medical group warned on Tuesday of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country, and said its teams have treated hundreds of patients in the region of the capital, Khartoum.",
      "Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF \u2014 said that the alarming spike began in mid-May, with Khartoum's twin city, Omdurman, as the epicenter.",
      "She said MSF treated almost 2,000 suspected cholera cases in the past week alone. There were no immediate official figures of fatalities from cholera in this latest outbreak, though an aid worker said he was told on Monday of 12 people dying of cholera.",
      "In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan\u2019s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.",
      "Sudan plunged into war more than two years ago, when tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group, or RSF, exploded with battles in Khartoum and across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher, and the African nation has been engulfed by what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.",
      "More than 14 million people have been displaced and forced from their homes and disease outbreaks, famine and atrocities have mounted as the country entered its third year of war.",
      "Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said on Saturday that the recent increase in cholera cases is estimated to average 600 to 700 per week, over the past four weeks.",
      "He attributed the surge to the return of many Sudanese to the Khartoum region \u2014 people who had fled their homes to escape the fighting and who are now coming back. Their returns have strained the city's dwindling water resources, he said.",
      "Last week, the Sudanese military said it had regained control of the Greater Khartoum area from the paramilitary forces.",
      "On Monday, Mohanad Elbalal, co-founder of the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, said he was told that 12 people had died of cholera in Omdurman, including a relative of one of his kitchen staff.",
      "Bakker, the MSF coordinator, said Tuesday that the group's treatment centers in Omdurman are overwhelmed and that the \u201cscenes are disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany patients are arriving too late to be saved,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture.\u201d",
      "She called for a united response, including water, sanitation and hygiene programs and more treatment facilities.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament adopted a bill Tuesday to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "The National Assembly vote is a key step on the long-debated issue, though others remain before the bill can become law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of all the patients and their loved ones that I\u2019ve met over more than a decade. Many are no longer here, and they always told me: Keep fighting,\" said Olivier Falorni, the bill's general rapporteur, amid applause from fellow lawmakers.",
      "The proposed measure on lethal medication defines assisted dying as allowing use under certain conditions so that people may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it. A definitive vote on the measure could take months to be scheduled amid France\u2019s long and complex process. The National Assembly has final say over the Senate.",
      "Activists have criticized the complexity and length of the parliamentary process that they say is penalizing patients waiting for end-of-life options.",
      "In parallel, another bill on palliative care meant to reinforce measures to relieve pain and preserve patients\u2019 dignity was also adopted Tuesday, unanimously.",
      "To benefit, patients would need to be over 18 and be French citizens or live in France.",
      "A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness \u201cat an advanced or terminal stage,\u201d is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will.",
      "Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease won\u2019t be eligible.",
      "The person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection. If approved, a doctor would deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home or at a nursing home or a health care facility.",
      "A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalizing end-of-life options, and opinion polls show growing support over the past 20 years.",
      "Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",
      "\u201cWhat a long road it has been, contrary to what the public thought, contrary to what the French people believed,\u201d said Jonathan Denis, president of the Association for the Right to Die With Dignity (ADMD).",
      "Earlier this month, Macron suggested he could ask French voters to approve the measure via referendum if parliament discussions get off track.",
      "Macron on Tuesday called the vote an important step, adding on social media that \"with respect for different sensibilities, doubts, and hopes, the path of fraternity I had hoped for is gradually beginning to open. With dignity and humanity.\u201d",
      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "\u201cI cannot accept that French men and women have to go to Switzerland \u2014 if they can afford it \u2014 or to Belgium to be supported in their choice, or that French men and women are being accompanied clandestinely in other countries,\" Denis said.",
      "French religious leaders this month issued a joint statement to denounce the bill, warning about the dangers of an \u201canthropological rupture.\u201d The Conference of Religious Leaders in France (CRCF), which represents the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist communities, said the proposed measures risk exerting pressure on older people and those with illnesses or disabilities.",

      "Haitians with HIV are defying stigma as they publicly denounce USAID cuts implemented by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that has led to a dwindling of life-saving medication",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A video showing dozens of people marching toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister elicited gasps from some viewers as it circulated recently on social media. The protesters, who were HIV positive, did not conceal their faces \u2014 a rare occurrence in a country where the virus is still heavily stigmatized.",
      "\u201cCall the minister of health! We are dying!\u201d the group chanted.",
      "The protesters risked being shunned by society to warn that Haiti is running out of HIV medication just months after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump slashed more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall aid across the globe.",
      "At a hospital near the northern city of Cap-Haitien, Dr. Eugene Maklin said he struggles to share that reality with his more than 550 HIV patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to them, to tell them that they\u2019re not going to find medication,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a suicide.\u201d",
      "More than 150,000 people in Haiti have HIV or AIDS, according to official estimates, although nonprofits believe the number is much higher.",
      "David Jeune, a 46-year-old hospital community worker, is among them. He became infected 19 years ago after having unprotected sex. \u201cI was scared to let people know because they would point their finger at you, saying you are infecting others with AIDS,\u201d he said.",
      "His fear was so great that he didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even his mother. But that fear dissipated with the support Jeune said he received from nonprofits. His confidence grew to the point where he participated in Monday\u2019s protest.",
      "\u201cI hope Trump will change his mind,\u201d he said, noting that his medication will run out in November. \u201cLet the poor people get the medication they need.\u201d",
      "Patrick Jean No\u00ebl, a representative of Haiti\u2019s Federation of Associations of HIV, said that at least five clinics, including one that served 2,500 patients, were forced to close after the USAID funding cuts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay silent,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people need to come out.\u201d",
      "But most people with HIV in Haiti are reluctant to do so, said Dr. Sabine Lustin, executive director of the Haiti-based nonprofit Promoters of Zero AIDS Goal.",
      "The stigma is so strong that many patients are reluctant to pick up their medication in person. Instead, it is sent via packages wrapped as gifts to not arouse suspicion, Lustin said.",
      "Lustin\u2019s organization, which helps some 2,000 people across Haiti, receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While their funding hasn\u2019t been cut, she said that shortly after Trump was sworn in, the agency banned prevention activities because they targeted a group that is not a priority. By that, Lustin said she understood they were referring to gay men.",
      "That means the organization can no longer distribute up to 200,000 free condoms a year or educate people about the disease.",
      "\u201cYou risk an increase in infections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a young population who is sexually active who can\u2019t receive the prevention message and don\u2019t have access to condoms.\u201d",
      "On a recent sunny morning, a chorus of voices drowned out the din of traffic in Haiti\u2019s capital, growing louder as protesters with HIV marched defiantly toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell the government that we exist, and we are people like any other person,\u201d one woman told reporters.",
      "Another marching alongside her said, \u201cWithout medication, we are dying. This needs to change.\u201d",
      "Three days after Monday's protest, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, announced that he had met with activists and would try to secure funding.",
      "Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations across Haiti are fretting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Marie Denis-Luque, founder and executive director of CHOAIDS, a nonprofit that cares for Haitian orphans with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe only have medication until July.\u201d",
      "Her voice broke as she described her frantic search for donations for the orphans, who are cared for by HIV-positive women in Cap-Haitien after gang violence forced them to leave Port-au-Prince.",
      "Denis-Luque said she has long advocated for the orphans\u2019 visibility.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding these children. They are part of society,\u201d she said, adding that she smiled when she saw the video of Monday\u2019s protest. \u201cI was like, whoa, things have changed tremendously. The stigma is real, but I think what I saw \u2026 was very encouraging to me. They can\u2019t be silenced.\u201d",
      "Experts say Haiti could see a rise in HIV infections because medications are dwindling at a time that gang violence and poverty are surging.",
      "Dr. Alain Casseus, infectious disease division chief at Zamni Lasante, the largest non-governmental healthcare provider in Haiti, said they expected to see a surge in patients given the funding cuts, but that hasn\u2019t happened because traveling by land in Haiti is dangerous since violent gangs control main roads and randomly open fire on vehicles.",
      "He warned that abruptly stopping medication is dangerous, especially because many Haitians do not have access or cannot afford nutritious food to strengthen their immune system.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long, especially given the situation in Haiti, to enter a very bad phase,\u201d he said of HIV infections. And even if some funding becomes available, a lapse in medication could cause resistance to it, he said.",
      "Casseus said gang violence also could accelerate the rates of infection via rapes or physical violence as medication runs out.",
      "At the New Hope Hospital run by Maklin in Haiti\u2019s northern region, shelves are running empty. He used to receive more than $165,000 a year to help HIV/AIDS patients. But that funding has dried up.",
      "\u201cThose people are going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or where we\u2019re going to get more medication.\u201d",
      "The medication controls the infection and allows many to have an average life expectancy. Without it, the virus attacks a person\u2019s immune system, and they develop AIDS, the late stage of an HIV infection.",
      "Reaction is swift when Dr. Maklin tells his patients that in two months, the hospital won\u2019t have any HIV medication left.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to keep living.\u201d",

      "The 34-year-old blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics.",
      "\"That would be the dream, and I\u2019d love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,\u201d Rizvi said.",
      "The London resident, fully blind from the age of 7 because of congenital glaucoma, only took up the sport a decade ago and is now the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world for his category.",
      "Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.",
      "\u201cOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don\u2019t need to have a cane or anything of this sort,\" he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d",
      "The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",
      "The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys \u2014 no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.",
      "\u201cYou really need to anticipate after you\u2019ve heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,\u201d he said. \"You obviously can\u2019t see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it\u2019s a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take.",
      "Rizvi didn't even know that tennis was an option until he visited Metro Blind Sport in London a decade ago. He was hooked right away.",
      "\u201cI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,\" he said, \"the majority of them wouldn\u2019t have any idea because it\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?\u201d",
      "The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends \u201cTeam GB\u201d to an international competition.",
      "Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.",
      "\u201cUnless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.\u201d",
      "Rizvi, who is married and works in finance, originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. He discussed his childhood \u2014 his father is Pakistani and his mother is Indian \u2014 in a TEDx Talk he gave as a student at UCL.",
      "Invented in Japan by Takei Miyoshi in 1984, blind tennis is played around the world. Last year's world championships in Italy were the largest to date with 117 players from 20 countries, the International Blind Tennis Association said.",
      "Rizvi has won several national titles, a European championship, the world championship in 2023 \u2014 as well as gold that year at the ISBA World Games. He is also the two-time defending champion of the Play Your Way to Wimbledon tournament.",
      "The International Paralympic Committee handbook spells out that the sport or discipline must be \u201cwidely and regularly practiced\u201d in at least 32 countries and three continents.",
      "\u201cI really want it to be in the Paralympics,\u201d Rizvi said, \"but I also want this to be a mainstream sport which can be part of the ATP Tour, part of Grand Slam tournaments, just like wheelchair tennis has made such amazing leaps forward. I\u2019d love for blind tennis to be there as well because it\u2019s definitely got the potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got the countries, the continents, the people, the passion behind it.\"",

      "Reproductive rights advocates are suing Arizona to unravel several laws regulating abortion access in the state",
      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Thursday to unravel several laws regulating abortion in the state.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by two providers in the state and the Arizona Medical Association. It comes more than six months after voters enshrined in the state constitution access to abortions up to fetal viability, which is the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.",
      "The advocates are seeking to undo laws including those that bar abortions sought based on genetic abnormalities, require informed consent in-person at least 24 hours before the procedure and offer an opportunity to view the ultrasound, and prohibit abortion medication delivered by mail and the use of tele-health for abortion care.",
      "\u201cThese stigmatizing and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions violate the right to reproductive freedom established by Arizona voters last November, and it\u2019s time for them to go,\u201d Rebecca Chan, staff attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \u201cArizonans are perfectly capable of making decisions about their own reproductive futures.\"",
      "The state attorney general's office is reviewing the complaint, and an agency spokesperson noted that state law should be in line with the amendment approved by voters last November. Arizona was one of a handful of states that passed ballot measures in the 2024 general election enshrining the right to abortion to their state constitutions.",
      "Earlier this year, an Arizona judge blocked the state's 15-week abortion ban.",
      "Peter Gentala, president of Center for Arizona Policy, a socially conservative nonprofit, said it is too early to determine if the organization will intervene in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWomen\u2019s health is important and this lawsuit reflects an agenda to maximize abortion in Arizona and that comes at a cost to women\u2019s health,\u201d he said.",

      "The U.S. social safety net would be jolted if the budget bill backed by President Donald Trump and passed Thursday by the House of Representatives becomes law.",
      "It would require many low-income adults to work to receive Medicaid health insurance coverage and more to work to get food assistance, require hospitals to verify the citizenship status of patients, and cut funding for services like birth control to the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Supporters of the bill say the moves will save money, root out waste and encourage personal responsibility.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "The measure, which also includes tax cuts, passed the House by one vote and could have provisions reworked again as it heads to the Senate.",
      "Here's a look at the potential impact.",
      "Starting next year, many able-bodied Medicaid enrollees will be required to show that they work in exchange for the health insurance coverage.",
      "While about 92% of people enrolled now meet the requirement, roughly 5 million would likely lose their coverage, according to previous estimates of an earlier version of the bill provided by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Increased eligibility checks and red tape related to work requirements may result in some people wrongly getting booted off, said Eduardo Conrado, the president of Ascension, a health care system that operates hospitals across 10 states.",
      "That could spell trouble for rural hospitals, in particular, who will see their small pool of patients go from paying for their emergency care with Medicaid coverage to not paying anything at all. Hospitals could have to eat their costs.",
      "\u201cAdding work requirements is not just a policy change, it\u2019s a shift away from the purpose of the program,\u201d Conrado said of the rule.",
      "Only Arkansas has had a work requirement that kicks people off for noncompliance. More than 18,000 lost coverage after it kicked in in 2018, and the programs was later blocked by federal courts.",
      "Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, said work requirements do not result in more people having jobs \u2014 but in fewer people having health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you lose your job going forward, good luck to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a good chance you\u2019re going to be uninsured because of this bill.\u201d",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, already requires work for some of its roughly 42 million recipients. Adults ages 18-54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents must work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month, or else be limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation passed by the House would raise the work requirement to age 65 and also extend it to parents without children younger than age 7. The bill also would limit the ability to waive work requirements in areas with unemployment rates significantly above the national average.",
      "The combination of those changes could put 6 million adults at risk of losing SNAP benefits, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Like work requirements for Medicaid, those for SNAP tend to cause a decrease in participation without increasing employment, according to an April report by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project.",
      "Under the bill, the federal government would punish states that use their own state dollars to provide Medicaid-covered services to immigrants lacking legal status or to provide subsidies to help them buy health insurance.",
      "Some states that provide that sort of coverage extend it only to children.",
      "Those states would see federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population \u2014 typically low-income adults \u2014 drop from 90% to 80%.",
      "That could mean states pull back that Medicaid coverage to avoid the federal penalty.",
      "\u201cIf that penalty of 10% is imposed, we would expect that states will have to drop that coverage,\u201d said Georgetown's Alker.",

      "Planned Parenthood says a provision barring it from receiving Medicaid funds could lead to about one-third of its health centers closing.",
      "The group said about 200 centers are at risk \u2014 most of them in states where abortion is legal. In those states, the number of Planned Parenthood centers could be cut in half.",
      "Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, also offers other health services, including birth control and cancer screening.",
      "Federal money was already barred from paying for abortion, but state Medicaid funds in some states now cover it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a fight for survival \u2014 not just for Planned Parenthood, but for the ability of everyone to get high-quality, non-judgmental health care,\u201d Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That has big implications for the fall vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "The FDA deflected questions about the new policy at Thursday's meeting to decide whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. The committee\u2019s recommendation is nonbinding guidance ahead of an agency decision.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "With JN.1 descendants still dominating worldwide, Pfizer and Moderna representatives told panelists Thursday that their current vaccines remain effective, although switching to a newer subtype, LP.8.1, could provide even more protection. Novavax said sticking with the parent strain JN.1 \u2014 the company\u2019s current vaccine formula \u2014 might be best.",
      "The challenge for regulators is there's no way to predict how the virus will evolve by the time fall vaccinations begin.",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued guidance that last year's version remained OK but that vaccine-makers could also choose an update. A representative for the organization told FDA panelists that current data on the COVID-19's continuing evolution might not yet warrant switching to a newer subtype. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency recently recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "While demand for vaccinations has dropped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 30,000 to 50,000 adults have died from COVID-19 since October. The virus continues to cause \u201cenormous burden\u201d on the health care system, CDC\u2019s Dr. Fiona Havers told panelists. Older adults count for most hospitalizations and deaths but COVID-19 also is \u201ca major cause of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d especially in children under 2 -- many of whom had no underlying medical problems before their infections.",
      "The strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The CDC's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "CDC staffers presented real-world data Thursday showing that getting a booster last fall offered added protection even in people who had been infected and previously vaccinated. Company studies reached the same conclusion \u2014 including one by Moderna that compared medical records of about 900,000 people.",

      "\u201cThe spying operation presumably served to prepare further intelligence operations in Germany, possibly even leading to killing,\u201d the German Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office said.",
      "German prosecutors said at the beginning of May 2024, Vardges I. received an order from a Russian intelligence agency to spy on a man living in Germany who fought in Ukraine's armed forces after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "To do this, Vardges I. recruited Robert A. and Arman S., who are accused of trying to lure the man to a meeting in a cafe in downtown Frankfurt with the aim of identifying him and gathering further information about him. Because the man had previously been in touch with German police, no meeting ever took place, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said, adding that the three men remain in custody.",
      "The charges against the men, filed May 16, are the latest in a series of cases across Europe where Ukrainians and other nationals are accused of working on behalf of Russia\u2019s intelligence services.",

      "In April 2024, two German-Russian men were arrested in Germany on suspicion of espionage, one of them accused of agreeing to carry out attacks on potential targets including U.S. military facilities in hopes of sabotaging aid for Ukraine, prosecutors said.",
      "Western officials have accused Russia and its proxies of staging dozens of attacks ranging from arson and sabotage to cyberattacks and espionage since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Russia has previously been accused of trying to kill people in Germany who have a connection to the war in Ukraine.",
      "In July 2024, Western officials said a plot was uncovered to kill Armin Papperger, CEO of defense company Rheinmetall which provides weapons to Ukraine.",
      "In 2019, a Russian national, Vadim Krasikov, was convicted in Germany of killing a Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya. Krasikov was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released as part of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine in 2024.",
      "At his sentencing, German judges said Krasikov had acted on the orders of Russian authorities, who gave him a false identity, passport and the resources to carry out the killing.",

      "\u201cMany people from the two communities were forced into concentration camps where they were starved to death and their skulls were taken to Germany for so-called scientific research,\" Namibian President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah said at Wednesday's ceremony. \u201cThese horrendous acts are now part of our collective history of resistance and resilience.\u201d",
      "The killings of Herero and Nama men, women and children have been recognized as the first genocide of the 20th century. Historians say von Trotha, who was sent to German South West Africa to put down an uprising by the Herero people, instructed his troops to wipe out the entire tribe. They say that the majority of the Herero people, about 65,000, were killed as were at least 10,000 Nama.",
      "Symbolic candles were lit at Wednesday's remembrance ceremony, which was also attended by leaders and descendants of the Herero and Nama people. Namibia chose May 28 as the day to mark the genocide because it was the date Germany finally gave the order to close down the concentration camps.",
      "Germany was the colonial ruler of Namibia from 1884 until 1915, when it gave up the territory to South Africa. Namibia finally gained independence from South Africa in 1990.",
      "There have been calls by the affected communities in Namibia for years for the government to declare a remembrance day in honour of those who died.",
      "Talks between Germany and Namibia over finding a suitable settlement for Germany's role in the genocide have been going on for a decade. In 2018, Germany also returned more than a dozen skulls and other human remains that were taken from Namibia for pseudo-scientific racial experiments. They had been stored in German hospitals, museums and universities for decades.",

    "story": [
      "British journalist Dom Phillips was working for years on a book about saving the Amazon when he was killed in the region by fishermen in 2022",
      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- After British journalist Dom Phillips was shot and killed while researching an ambitious book on how to protect the world\u2019s largest rainforest, friends vowed to finish the project. Three years later, their task is complete.",
      "\u201cHow to Save the Amazon,\u201d published Tuesday in Brazil and England ahead of its U.S. release, was pieced together by fellow journalists who immersed themselves in Phillips\u2019 notes, outlines and the handful of chapters he\u2019d already written. The resulting book, scheduled to be published in the U.S. on June 10, pairs Phillips\u2019 own writing with others\u2019 contributions in a powerful examination of the cause for which he gave his life.",
      "In addition to the core group who led the work on finishing the book, other colleagues and friends helped to edit chapters, including The Associated Press journalists Fabiano Maisonnave and David Biller.",
      "Phillips, who had been a regular contributor to The Guardian newspaper, was taking one of the final reporting trips planned for his book when he was gunned down by fishermen on June 5, 2022, in western Amazon\u2019s Javari Valley. Also killed was Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian expert on Indigenous tribes who had made enemies in the region for defending the local communities from intruding fishermen, poachers and illegal gold miners. Their deaths made headlines around the world. Nine people have been indicted in the killings.",
      "\u201cIt was just a horrifying, really sad moment. Everybody was trying to think: How can you deal with something like this? And the book was there,\u201d said Jonathan Watts, an Amazon-based environmental writer for The Guardian who coauthored the foreword and one of the chapters.",
      "Under the leadership of Phillips\u2019 widow, Alessandra Sampaio, a group of five friends agreed to carry the project forward. Along with Watts, the core group also included Andrew Fishman, the Rio-based president of The Intercept Brasil; Phillips\u2019 agent, Rebecca Carter; David Davies, a colleague from his days in London as a music journalist; and Tom Hennigan, Latin America correspondent for The Irish Times.",
      "\u201cIt was a way to not just feel awful about what had happened, but to get on with something. Especially because so many of Dom\u2019s friends are journalists,\u201d Watts said. \u201cAnd what you fall back on is what you know best, which is journalism.\u201d",
      "By the time of his death, Phillips had traveled extensively across the Amazon and had completed an introduction and nearly four of the 10 planned chapters. He also left behind an outline of the remaining chapters, with different degrees of detail, and many pages of handwritten notes, some of them barely legible.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say even Dom didn\u2019t yet know what he would do exactly in those chapters,\u201d Watts said.",
      "Phillips was searching for hope. He promised his editors a character-driven travel book in which readers would get to know a wide-ranging cast of people living in the area, \u201call of whom know and understand the Amazon intimately and have innovative solutions for the millions of people who live there.\u201d",
      "The group led by Sampaio selected writers for the remaining chapters, with subjects ranging from a bioeconomy initiative in Brazil\u2019s Acre state to global funding for rainforest preservation. Indigenous leader Beto Marubo of the Javari Valley was recruited to co-write an afterword. The team also launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to pay for more reporting trips.",
      "Among the group\u2019s challenges was ensuring that the book reflected a political shift in Brazil\u2019s approach to the Amazon in the years since Phillips\u2019 death. Most of Phillips\u2019 research was done during the term of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, as Brazil\u2019s Amazon deforestation reached a 15-year high in 2021. The pace of destruction slowed after Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 defeat by leftist leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Throughout the finished book\u2019s more than 300 pages, fragments of hope mix with grim realities. In Chapter 2, \u201cCattle Chaos,\u201d Phillips notes that 16% of Brazil\u2019s Amazon has already been converted to pasture. Even a farmer who has become a model for successfully increasing productivity without clearing most of his land is criticized for his widespread use of fertilizers.",
      "In his chapter on bioeconomy, journalist Jon Lee Anderson visits a reforestation initiative where Benki Piy\u00e3ko, an Ashaninka leader, promotes environmental restoration coupled with ayahuasca treatment and a fish farm. But the veteran reporter doesn\u2019t see how it can be scalable and reproducible given man-made threats and climate change.",
      "Later in the chapter, he quotes Marek Hanusch, a German economist for the World Bank, as saying: \u201cAt the end of the day, deforestation is a macroeconomic choice, and so long as Brazil\u2019s growth model is based on agriculture, you\u2019re going to see expansion into the Amazon.\u201d",
      "In the foreword, the group of five organizers state that \u201cLike Dom, none of us was under any illusion that our writing would save the Amazon, but we could certainly follow his lead in asking the people who might know.\u201d",
      "But in this book stained by blood and dim hope, there is another message, according to Watts: \u201cThe most important thing is that this is all about solidarity with our friend and with journalism in general.\u201d",

      "Activists from three groups linked to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, headed by former prime minister Khaleda Zia gathered on the streets outside its party headquarters, under heightened security.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s rally was held after weeks of political tensions after interim leader and Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus threatened to quit and the influential military chief publicly declared his support for an election in December.",
      "Zia, who has been suffering from ill-health for several years, recently returned to Bangladesh after four months of medical treatment in London, putting further pressure on Bangladesh's interim government to call an election.",

      "When Yunus came to power, he promised to make reforms in areas including the election law, women's rights and general administration, but the process has been slow and his critics believe he is using delaying tactics to remain in power.",
      "The 10 months of rule under Yunus also marked a visible rise of influence by Islamists in the Muslim-majority country, which is governed largely by a secular constitution and legal system. A fatigued military, which has been out of barracks since July last year to maintain law and order, is unhappy because of the delay in returning to democracy.",
      "The BNP recently met with Yunus and reiterated its demand for an election in December, saying that if Yunus quits, the country will find an alternative leader. But Yunus' associates later said he was staying.",
      "Yunus promised to hold an election by June 2026, depending on the extent of reforms it has undertaken. The BNP, which is hopeful of forming the next government in absence of Hasina\u2019s Awami League, said the pace of implementation of reforms should not be an excuse to delay the election and argued that the reform is a continuous process.",

      "Filosa, who is currently Stellantis\u2019 chief operating officer for the Americas and chief quality officer, takes the post effective June 23, when he is expected to announce his leadership team.",
      "The move returns the running of Stellantis, created from the 2021 merger of France\u2019s PSA Peugeot with Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, to Italian hands after three years under Tavares, who previously served as Peugeot\u2019s top executive. John Elkann, heir to the Fiat-founding Agnelli family, remains chairman.",
      "Elkann praised Filosa\u2019s \u201cdeep understanding of our company, including its people, who he views as our core strength, and of our industry.\u201d",
      "Robert Peugeot said the board\u2019s choice was unanimous, calling Filosa a \u201cnatural choice\u201d due to his leadership track record and knowledge of the business and \u201cthe complex dynamics facing our industry.\u201d",
      "Filosa joined Fiat in 1999, spending much of his career in Latin America where held positions from plant manager to head of purchasing and later chief operating officer. He was credited with making the Fiat brand the regional market leader and boosting the market share of the Peugeot, Citroen, Ram and Jeep brands.",
      "He was promoted to chief operating officer of the Americas in 2024 in an executive shakeup as sales slumped in North America, its main source of profits.",
      "Stellantis has been lagging globally in the transition to electric powertrains and facing stiff Chinese competition. Analysts also have said Stellantis, with 14 brands, is yoked by too many under-performers, including Maserati and Chrysler.",

      "Germany has been the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has plunged into diplomatic efforts to try to secure a ceasefire and keep Western support for Ukraine intact since becoming Germany\u2019s leader three weeks ago. European leaders have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in U.S.-led peace talks.",

      "\u201cAt the same time, there is a big number of nuances to be discussed that can\u2019t be neglected and which neither party is going to sacrifice, because of its national interests,\u201d Peskov told reporters. \u201cJust like the United States, Russia has its national interests that are of primary importance to us.\u201d",
      "He said that Moscow will \u201csoon\u201d deliver its promised memorandum on a framework for a peace settlement.",
      "Merz said on Monday that Germany and other major allies are no longer imposing any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine as it fights to repel Russia's full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022.",
      "Merz\u2019s government hasn't said whether it will supply its Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, something his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, refused to do and which Merz advocated for as opposition leader.

      "Taurus missiles have a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles). The German- and Swedish-made missiles, which are equipped with stealth technology, would be able to reach targets deep in Russia from Ukrainian soil, including the Black Sea.

      "Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, will hold a series of high-level meetings with senior Taiwan leaders to discuss U.S.-Taiwan relations during her visit Wednesday and Thursday, said the American Institute in Taiwan, which acts as the de-facto American embassy in Taiwan in liu of formal diplomatic relations.",
      "Trade, investment and \u201cother significant issues of mutual interest\u201d also are on the schedule, the institute said.",
      "\u201cThe visit underscores the United States\u2019 commitment to its partnership with Taiwan and reaffirms our shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific,\u201d the institute said.",
      "China routinely protests such visits, which it views as a violation of U.S. commitments.",
      "Duckworth and her staff are the second U.S. congressional delegation to visit Taiwan in as many days, demonstrating concerns in Washington over the island's security in the face of Chinese threats to invade, as well as its importance as a trade partner, particularly as the producer of 90% of the world's most advanced computer chips.",
      "Taiwan also faces 32% tariffs under the Trump administration, a figure the government in Taiwan is attempting to negotiate to a lower level without angering sectors such as agriculture that fear lower tariffs could open their markets to heightened competition from abroad.",

      "Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949 and Beijing still considers the island its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary. China refuses all contact with the government of President Lai Ching-te, whom China brands as a separatist, and seeks to maximize diplomatic pressure on Taiwan.",
      "While China sends military aircraft, ships and spy balloons near Taiwan as part of a campaign of daily harassment, special attention has been given this week to the location of the Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, whose hull was bought from Ukraine and then fitted out by China more than a decade ago. China has two aircraft carriers including the Liaoning, a third undergoing sea trials and a fourth under construction.",

      "There are concerns the carrier might stage military drills close to Taiwan that could be a further step toward a blockade, an act the U.S. would be required to respond to under its own laws. While the U.S. provides much of Taiwan's high-tech military hardware, the law is unclear whether it would send forces to aid Taiwan in the event of a conflict.",
      "Hu said the ministry would not comment on the possibility of drills near Taiwan, but considers all options while monitoring the Chinese military.",
      "The ministry \"anticipates the enemy as broadly as possible and defends against the enemy strictly. We also carefully evaluate and act accordingly,\u201d Hu said.",

On Friday, prosecutors requested the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, describing Le Scouarnec as \u201ca devil in a white coat.\u201d He's already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces.",
      "The new trial in Brittany, western France, began in February and has laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.",
      "During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.",
      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "Australian army whistleblower David McBride has lost a court bid to have his prison sentence reduced",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian army whistleblower David McBride, who leaked allegations of Australian war crimes in Afghanistan to the media, lost a court bid to have his prison sentence reduced on Wednesday.",
      "The three Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal judges unanimously rejected the 61-year-old former army lawyer\u2019s appeal against the severity of a five years and eight months prison sentence imposed a year ago.",
      "The judges also rejected McBride's argument that as a military officer he had sworn an oath to Queen Elizabeth II and therefore had a sworn duty to act in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo the contrary, the oath obliged the appellant (McBride) to discharge his duties \u2018according to the law,\u2019\u201d the judges said in a written summary of their ruling.",
      "McBride said through his lawyers that Australians would be outraged by the Court of Appeal decision.",
      "\u201cIt is my own conscience and the people of Australia that I answer to. I have kept my oath to the Australian people,\u201d McBride said in the lawyers\u2019 statement.",
      "McBride pleaded guilty last year to three charges, including theft and sharing with journalists documents classified as secret. He faced a potential life sentence.",
      "Rights advocates complain that McBride remains the only person to be imprisoned over allegations of war crimes committed by elite Australian special forces troops in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.",
      "A military report released in 2020 recommended 19 current and former soldiers face criminal investigations over 39 unlawful killings in Afghanistan.",
      "Former Special Air Service Regiment soldier Oliver Schulz was charged in March 2023 with murdering an unarmed Afghan in 2012. Schulz pleaded not guilty to the war crime and has yet to stand trial.",
      "Former SAS Cpl. Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia\u2019s most decorated living veteran, lost an appeal two weeks ago against a civil court ruling that he unlawfully killed four unarmed Afghans.",
      "Roberts-Smith said he would appeal his loss in the High Court. He has not been criminally charged.",
      "McBride\u2019s lawyers also said they would take their appeal to the Hight Court.",
      "\"We believe that only the High Court can properly grapple with the immense public interest and constitutional issues at the heart of this case,\u201d the lawyers\u2019 statement said.",
      "\u201cIt cannot be a crime to expose a crime. It cannot be illegal to tell the truth,\u201d the statement added.",
      "The lawyers also called on Attorney General Michelle Rowland, who was appointed after the Labor Party government was re-elected on May 3, to recommend McBride be pardoned.",
      "\u201cIt is now time for the attorney general to show leadership. To show Australians that this Labor government will no longer jail whistleblowers,\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "Rowland's office declined to comment on McBride's case. Attorneys general usually do not consider pardons in cases where appeal options remain available.",
      "The government was considering additional support for public sector whistleblowers, Rowland\u2019s office said.",
      "The documents provided by McBride became the source of a series of Australian Broadcasting Corp. reports in 2017 called the \"Afghan Files.\u201d The reports detailed allegations against Australian soldiers including the unlawful killing of men and children.",
      "The appeal court judges noted in their summary that McBride began taking home copies of hundreds of secret documents after becoming \u201cdissatisfied with what he perceived to be vexatious over-investigation of alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers.\u201d",
      "McBride declined to have further dealings with a journalist after the reporter revealed he intended to use the classified information for a story exposing war crime allegations, the judges said.",
      "McBride can be considered for parole after he has served two years and three months, meaning he must remain behind bars until at least August next year.",

      "TAIPEI -- Taiwan's president on Tuesday pledged to buy more American goods, including natural gas and oil, as the self-governing island seeks closer ties with the U.S. while threatened with a 32% tariff from the Trump administration.",
      "By purchasing more U.S. products that also include weapons and agricultural goods, Taiwan would not only create \u201cmore balanced bilateral trade\u201d with the U.S. but also boost its energy autonomy and resilience, said Lai Ching-te, the island\u2019s leader, while hosting a U.S. congressional delegation.",
      "Lai also said the island would be willing to participate in U.S. efforts to reindustrialize and to lead the world in artificial intelligence.",
      "Rep. Bruce Westerman, chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, told Lai that the U.S. produces a lot of food and fiber and is \u201calways looking for more friends to share that with.\u201d",
      "Trade and economic ties between Taiwan and the U.S. have grown closer in recent years. The island faces rising pressure from China, which sees the island as part of Chinese territory and vows to annex it, by force if necessary.",
      "Washington is bound by its own laws to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself, and politicians \u2014 both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 have come to believe it is in the U.S. interest to deter Beijing from attacking Taiwan.",
      "Many policymakers and analysts have argued that arming Taiwan includes not only weapons sales but closer economic and trade ties so the island is less vulnerable to economic coercion from the mainland.",
      "The U.S. is now the top destination for Taiwan's foreign investments, including $165 billion by Taiwan's semiconductor giant TSMC to build factories in Arizona to make advanced chips. The island also is the 7th largest market for U.S. agricultural exports, Lai said.",
      "However, the U.S. buys far more from Taiwan and had a trade deficit of $116.3 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.",
      "The 32% tariff, as proposed by President Donald Trump as part of his sweeping tariff plan, is on hold except a 10% baseline duty. Earlier this month, Lai downplayed the trade tensions between the U.S. and Taiwan as \u201cfrictions between friends.\u201d",
      "The congressional delegation stopped in Taipei as part of the group\u2019s larger visit to the Indo-Pacific region through Thursday, according to American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto U.S. diplomatic mission on the island.",

      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday he has appointed a team of legal experts to start working on a new constitution \u2014 which critics say could allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his current term ends.",
      "Erdogan, who has led Turkey as president since 2014 and was prime minister for more than a decade before that, has advocated for a new constitution arguing that the current one, which was drafted following a military coup in 1980, is outdated and retains elements of military influence even though it was amended several times.",
      "\u201cAs of yesterday, I have assigned 10 legal experts to begin their work, and with this effort, we will proceed with the preparations for the new constitution,\u201d Erdogan told his ruling party\u2019s local administrators in a speech. \u201cFor 23 years, we have repeatedly demonstrated our sincere intention to crown our democracy with a new civilian and libertarian constitution.\u201d",
      "Under the current constitution, Erdogan cannot run again unless early elections are called or the legal framework is changed. Critics see the push for a new constitution as a possible path for re-election, allowing legal changes that would bypass the constitutional term limits.",

      "NEW YORK -- Krista Vasquez had her heart set on getting married in a body-hugging, halter-style gown from Spain. In April, the Atlanta paramedic learned her dream dress would cost nearly $300 more because of new U.S. tariffs on imported goods.",
      "With little wiggle room in her timing, the bride-to-be quickly checked around for similar styles. The story was the same: any dresses from Europe would come with tariff-driven price increases ranging from $150 to $400. And that was before President Donald Trump said he would increase the tariff on goods produced in the European Union from 10% to 50%.",
      "Vasquez, 33, went with her first choice, fearing shipping delays or additional costs like a rush fee before her October wedding if she placed an order elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIt's already expensive enough to get married,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just kind of made me a little sad.\"",
      "Wedding cakes, decor, attire, flowers, party favors, photo and video equipment, tableware, wine and Champagne. Not many goods used in the wedding industry remain untouched by the tariffs Trump has imposed since returning to office. How much of the import taxes get passed down to consumers is up to florists, photographers, caterers and myriad other vendors and intermediaries, such as wholesalers.",
      "Olivia Sever, a 28-year-old online content creator in San Diego, has a lot of wedding shopping ahead of her. Much of what she wants may cost more because of tariffs. An immediate concern is some of her paper goods. Her wedding planner has already flagged a 10% price increase for the menus, place cards and signage she wanted for her September celebration in Hawaii.",
      "Sever said shifting to American goods isn't always cost-effective. For instance, flowers grown in Hawaii are in high demand, with increased prices to match, in response to 10% tariffs imposed on a large number of imports around the world. That includes flowers from Ecuador, Colombia and other countries that grow the bulk of the flowers the U.S. imports.",
      "\u201cThere's just so many unknowns, but we have our budget and we\u2019re trying to work within our budget,\u201d Sever said. \u201cIf that means we can\u2019t get these, you know, specific shell cups I want, then we just won\u2019t get them and we\u2019ll get something else.\u201d",
      "Here's a look from inside the wedding industry on tariffs.",
      "Clients of Phoenix cake artist Armana Christianson pay roughly $750 to $800 for one of her creations. She spent two years perfecting the 16 flavor combinations she offers.",
      "They range from simple vanilla bean, made with vanilla bean paste imported from Mexico, to dark chocolate raspberry with a whipped hazelnut ganache that's dependent on chocolates and powders from Belgium.",
      "Not all of Christianson's cost woes are tariff-driven. The chocolate industry was already struggling because of a cocoa bean shortage.",
      "\u201cI'm a small business with just myself as my employee. I've seen at minimum a 20% increase in just the chocolate I use. It's a type of chocolate that I've built into my recipes. Changing brands isn't acceptable,\u201d Christianson said.",
      "The imported white chocolate in her white chocolate mud cake, a popular flavor, shot up from $75 or $100 per cake to $150. She used nearly 10 pounds of it in a recent order, a cake that had five tiers.",
      "Christianson may have to come up with new recipes based on less expensive ingredients. In the meantime, she said, she's eating the cost of tariffs for clients already on her books.",
      "\u201cI don't have it in my contract where I can raise prices for unexpected events like this,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, that's something I have to add to new contracts for my future couples.\u201d",
      "Almost all bridal gowns are made in China or other parts of Asia \u2014 and so are many of the fabrics, buttons, zippers and other materials used, according to the National Bridal Retailers Association. Manufacturing in those countries, where labor generally costs less, has put the price of high-quality bridal gowns within reach for many American families.",
      "Retailers and manufacturers say the U.S. lacks enough skilled labor and production of specialized materials to fully serve the market. Skilled seamstresses are hard to find and often come from older generations.",
      "\u201cThe materials that we sell in a bridal shop include lace, beadwork, boning for the corsetry. We don\u2019t really make stuff like that in this country. There just aren\u2019t very many designers who create and put their whole looks together in this nation,\u201d said Christine Greenberg, founder and co-owner of the Urban Set Bride boutique in Richmond, Virginia.",
      "\u201cThe designs done here are normally very simple designs. You don\u2019t see a lot of American-made gowns that have a lot of detail, a lot of embroidered lace, and that\u2019s a really popular wedding gown style,\u201d she said.",
      "Many designers with gowns labeled made in the U.S. still are using imported materials, Greenberg noted.",
      "If Trump's highest tariffs on China are reinstated after a current pause, Greenberg said her small business will pay between $85,000 and $100,000 extra in import taxes this year.",
      "\u201cFor a small, family-owned business that only hosts one bride at a time, this will absolutely lead us and many others to close for good,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can't buy American when the products don't exist.\u201d",
      "Roughly 80% of cut flowers sold in the U.S. come from other countries. And lots of quality faux flowers are made in China.",
      "Colombia is a large supplier of roses, carnations and spray chrysanthemums. Ecuador is another major rose supplier. The Netherlands produces a huge share of tulips and other flowers. In addition, some of the cut greens used as filler in flower arrangements and bouquets in the U.S. are imported.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about cars and computer chips, they\u2019ve got inventory that\u2019s sitting there. It\u2019s already stateside. Our inventory turns in days and we saw the impact almost immediately,\u201d said Joan Wyndrum, co-founder of the online floral distributor Blooms by the Box. \u201cWe\u2019re all absorbing a little bit, but it\u2019s inevitable that it comes out on the consumer end of it.\u201d",
      "Wyndrum, who works directly with wholesalers and growers, said the U.S. flower industry isn\u2019t capable at the moment of absorbing all the production from elsewhere. She does a lot of business with U.S. suppliers, though, and sees a huge opportunity for growth stateside.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a benefit to the U.S. bride to have flowers grown here. It\u2019s the simple reason of freshness,\u201d she said.",
      "Jacqueline Vizcaino is a luxury wedding planner and event designer in Atlanta. She's also national president of the Wedding Industry Professionals Association, a 3,500-member, education-focused trade group whose members include transportation and photo booth providers, makeup artists, caterers, linen distributors and planners.",
      "Any one wedding may involve 40 or more vendors, Vizcaino said. Huge jumps in costs are already widespread due to tariffs, she said, florals and fabrics among them.",
      "With many weddings planned up to a year or more in advance, she and others in the industry are girding for more bad news.",
      "\u201cWe're going to see a lot of interactions that aren't so pleasant in the next eight to 12 months,\" she said.",
      "Tariffs have delayed decision-making among many couples planning weddings.",
      "\u201cDecisions are taking double the time because of the uncertainty. People are shopping around more and wanting (vendors) to lock in at the lowest price possible,\u201d Vizcaino said.",
      "Said McKenzi Taylor, a planner who coordinates weddings in Las Vegas, San Diego and the Black Hills in South Dakota: \u201cOur inquiry-to-booking window has grown from 40 days to 73. Cancellations are up so far this year, on pace to double from last year, with costs definitely being a concern for couples. My vendors are shaking in their boots.\u201d",

      "Macy\u2019s sales and profit slipped in its first quarter and the department store, citing more cautious customers and the impact that the U.S. trade war will have on the company and its shoppers, trimmed its profit forecast for 2025",
      "NEW YORK -- Macy\u2019s sales and profit slipped in its first quarter and the department store, citing more cautious customers and the impact that the U.S. trade war will have on the company and its shoppers, trimmed its profit forecast for 2025.",
      "However, the New York retailer which also owns upscale Bloomingdale\u2019s and the Bluemercury cosmetics chain, topped most performance expectations for the first three months of the year and maintained its sales forecast for the year.",
      "Shares rose more than 4% before the market opened Wednesday.",
      "Macy\u2019s sales dropped to $4.79 billion from $5 billion a year earlier, better than the $4.42 billion that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "Comparable sales, which include online channels, dipped 2%. Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury both saw comparable sales growth.",
      "Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, noted Bloomingdale's 3% comparable sales growth.",
      "\u201cGood execution from Bloomingdale\u2019s and its balanced assortment of luxury and prestige products has served it well,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is especially so compared to chains that play much more exclusively in the very high-price arena, which have lost customers and seen an erosion of spending.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur first quarter results give us confidence that we have the right strategy and team in place to navigate the current environment while we continue to invest in our customer on the path to returning Macy\u2019s, Inc. to sustainable profitable growth,\u201d Chairman and CEO Tony Spring said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "For the period ended May 3, Macy\u2019s earned $38 million, or 13 cents per share. That compares with $62 million, or 22 cents per share, a year ago.",
      "Stripping out certain items, earnings were 16 cents per share, which topped Wall Street\u2019s estimate by a penny.",
      "The company still anticipates 2025 sales in a range of $21 billion to $21.4 billion. It now expects full-year adjusted earnings between $1.60 and $2 per share. Its prior forecast was for an adjusted profit of $2.05 to $2.25 per share.",
      "Industry analysts had been projecting full-year sales of $21.03 billion and an adjusted per-share profit of $1.91.",
      "Macy\u2019s and other retailers are wrestling with uncertainty about tariffs that\u2019s making it hard to plan, while contending with customers who seem to have the same issues and are pulling back on spending.",
      "Teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters withdrew its financial outlook for the year earlier this month citing \u201cmacro uncertainty\u201d and said it would write down $75 million in spring and summer merchandise.",
      "Ross Stores did the same last week.",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, got a public scolding from President Donald Trump after it said this month that it has already raised prices on some items and would have to do so again right when the back-to-school shopping season kicks off. Trump told the retail giant that it should \u201ceat\u201d the additional costs created by his tariffs.",
      "Target Corp. announced last week that sales fell more than expected in the first quarter, and the retailer warned they will slip for all of 2025 as its customers, worried over the impact of tariffs and the economy, pull back on spending. The company said that it should be able to offset the majority of the impacts from tariffs.",
      "Trump\u2019s threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced May 12, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days. Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well as a 25% tariff on smartphones unless those products are made in America.",
      "But then on Sunday, Trump said that the U.S. will delay implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the EU from June 1 until July 9 to buy time for negotiations with the bloc.",
      "Macy\u2019s executives emphasized in March during the last earnings call that the company is facing lots of unpredictability given ever-changing tariff policies. But the company is focusing on what it can control and zeroing in on improving its merchandise and services.",
      "Company executives told analysts on the earnings call in March that Macy\u2019s has been working with its suppliers to increase variety and reduce redundant styles, while adding more exclusive offerings. It\u2019s also focusing on improving its store label brand.",

      "As if the impending arrival of your first child isn\u2019t stressful enough, you\u2019re undoubtedly shopping for a seemingly endless list of baby gear. Cribs, strollers, bottle warmers, sound machines and whatever the heck a MamaRoo is. You\u2019ll likely get most of that stuff from a baby registry. But the biggest baby gear item requires a more significant cash outlay: a new vehicle for your growing family.",
      "We can\u2019t help you pay for that, but we can point you toward five great SUVs of different sizes that all start for under $40,000. Edmunds\u2019 car experts focused on three qualities: 1) lots of space between the first and second-row seatbacks for bulky rear-facing infant safety seats; 2) big rear door openings to make it easy to get your newborn in and out; and 3) a roomy cargo area for all of your baby gear. The pricing below includes destination fees.",
      "Subcompact SUVs are not usually top choices for young families because of their limited space for cargo and child safety seats. The Volkswagen Taos is an exception. It\u2019s one of the roomiest models in its class and even rivals a Mazda CX-5 for all-around baby-toting usefulness. Got a rear-facing infant seat, or even a convertible seat, combined with a stroller and a travel crib? No problem \u2014 they\u2019ll all likely fit without having to slide the front seats far forward. The 2025 Taos also receives some welcome improvements such as an updated interior with a bigger center touchscreen and a more powerful engine that gets up to an EPA-estimated 31 mpg combined.",
      "2025 Taos starting price: $26,420",
      "The Niro is available as a hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicle. The hybrid comes oh-so-close to matching the Toyota Prius\u2019 fuel economy by getting up to an EPA-estimated 53 mpg combined. It also costs less than the Prius and has a more spacious back seat. The cargo area is nice-sized too. There are a lot of hybrid-powered SUVs available and the Niro is one of the least expensive. The plug-in version and the Niro Electric are considerably more expensive than the regular Niro hybrid, but otherwise they share the same family-friendly utility.",
      "2025 Niro starting price: $28,385",
      "The CR-V has long been a go-to choice for parents and rightfully so. It\u2019s an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick. It has a vast back seat, so you won\u2019t likely have to move the front seats up to accommodate the infant car seat in any of the rear positions. The CR-V\u2019s rear door openings are huge, and cargo space is among the roomiest you\u2019ll find for a compact SUV. The entry-level versions of the CR-V come with a 190-horsepower engine, while the more expensive trims have a 204-horsepower hybrid powertrain that gets up to an EPA-estimated 40 mpg combined.",
      "2025 CR-V starting price: $31,495",
      "The Equinox EV is Edmunds\u2019 top-rated electric SUV under $40,000. It has loads of space between its first and second seating rows for fitting a rear-facing child seat. The cargo area is also of a decent size, though ultimately you\u2019ll find more in the CR-V and other compact SUVs. Its electric vehicle credentials are also excellent. It traveled 356 miles on a full charge in the independent Edmunds EV Range Test and has enough power to zip around town without issue. Basically, the Equinox EV is a great family-friendly SUV, and a great EV, at a reasonable price.",
      "2025 Equinox EV starting price: $34,995",
      "The Santa Fe is the most expensive vehicle on our list, but it is a great choice if you foresee multiple children and want to get a head start with a slightly bigger vehicle. It has three rows of seating. That\u2019s good for future-proofing and just generally handy for those times when you\u2019re going out to dinner with the grandparents and want to take just one vehicle. The Santa Fe isn\u2019t quite as large as Hyundai\u2019s Palisade, but it\u2019s roomy enough for new families and is less expensive. It has also received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick+ award for crash test results and is available with a hybrid powertrain that gets up to 36 mpg.",

      "Stragglers beware: U.S. travelers flying with United Airlines will have to check in to domestic flights a little earlier starting next week",
      "NEW YORK -- Stragglers beware: U.S. travelers flying with United Airlines will have to check in to domestic flights a little earlier starting next week. That is, if they're customers only taking carry-on bags.",
      "Effective June 3, United's \u201ccheck-in cutoff\u201d for most U.S. flights will be 45 minutes before departure. That's the same deadline United has for passengers checking luggage at the airport but 15 minutes earlier than the current one for people without bags to check.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, a United spokesperson said the change to a single cut-off minimum \u201cbrings greater consistency for our customers\u201d and conforms with the policies of many other airlines.",
      "Checking in for a flight confirms a passenger's booking and intent to travel ahead of takeoff. Most major U.S. carriers have online check-in systems that can be used at least 24 hours in advance, so the process no longer reflects when many travelers arrive at the airport. But it's still an important step since boarding passes are issued once check-ins are completed.",
      "Other U.S. and international carriers have tightened their check-in and boarding policies as part of their strategies for maintaining on-time departures, particularly amid the high demand that followed the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Generally speaking, checking in allows airports and airlines to prepare for upcoming flights \u2014 from confirming seat assignments to making sure passenger names are at the security checkpoint. Check-in cutoffs, or the latest possible time to claim a flight reservation, are typically earlier for international flights to account for the time needed to check passports and clear customs.",
      "Still, requirements may vary by airline and airport. Dubai-based Emirates, for example, closes online check-ins 90 minutes before departure. Ireland\u2019s Ryanair allows online check-in up to two hours before a flight; passengers still may check in at the airport 40 minutes in advance, but for a fee.",
      "Here's what check-in cutoffs look like for United and some other U.S. carriers.",
      "Again, if you\u2019re flying United within the U.S., you'll need to check in to your flight at least 45 minutes prior to takeoff as of June 3.",
      "While the new cutoff applies to most of United's domestic trips, check-in deadlines may vary by location and route. The carrier's website notes that St. Thomas' airport in the U.S. Virgin Islands has a check-in time limit of 90 minutes prior to departure \u2014 the same cutoff listed for flights between Guam and Honolulu.",
      "For international flights, United requires checking in at least an hour before departure. But many airports have earlier deadlines \u2014 such as 75 minutes for major airports in Paris and Dubai, and 90 minutes for the airports in Toronto and Lagos, Nigeria.",
      "Delta passengers not checking any bags still have a minimum of a half-hour before a domestic flight to check in. Travelers with luggage to check need to get to the airline ticket counter at least 45 minutes prior, Delta's website notes, per an update that went into effect last month.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP on Tuesday, Delta said it had made this \u201cminor change\" so that \u201cDelta teams can ensure all customers have a great experience.\u201d",
      "For international flights, Delta travelers must be checked in at least 1 hour before departure. But, like other carriers, Delta's minimum check-in requirements can vary by location for certain airports. Delta customers checking bags at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, for example, are supposed to check in an hour before departure whether their flights are domestic or international.",
      "If you're flying with American Airlines within the U.S., the deadline for checking in and checking a bag before a flight is 45 minutes ahead of departure, according to the carrier's website.",
      "For trips to or from locations outside the U.S., the cutoff to both check-in for your flight and check a bag is 60 minutes ahead of takeoff. But again, a handful of airports have earlier requirements.",
      "Passengers with more than a carry-on bag should get to the airline counter at least 45 minutes before a scheduled flight on Southwest. The carrier warns that baggage destined for a plane's cargo hold is considered a \u201clate check\u201d and not guaranteed to get on your flight if it's dropped off less than 45 minutes ahead of departure.",
      "Beyond baggage, if Southwest travelers aren\u2019t checked-in and in the boarding area at least 10 minutes prior to departure, their reservation could be canceled, a Southwest spokesperson told the AP via email.",
      "The carrier did not specify any additional, firm check-in cutoffs for domestic flights. For international trips, Southwest's website notes that all passengers and their luggage must be checked in a minimum of 60 minutes prior to departure. And again, that can vary \u2014 with flights departing Aruba, for example, having an earlier deadline of 75 minutes before takeoff for passengers with or without checked bags.",
      "Alaska requires a minimum of 50 minutes before takeoff to check in passengers for flights within the U.S., whether or not they have bags to check. The cutoff is 60 minutes for international flights, the carrier\u2019s website notes.",
      "Again, there are exceptions for certain locations and airports. Passengers traveling from Guadalajara, Mexico, for example, have to check their baggage and into their flights at least 90 minutes ahead of time.",

      "A large majority of European Union countries are demanding that Hungary revise a new law that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities",
      "BRUSSELS -- A large majority of European Union countries on Tuesday called on Hungary to revise a new law that allows bans on public events by LGBTQ+ communities, as pressure mounts on the country\u2019s populist government over democratic backsliding.",
      "In a declaration, at least 20 out of the EU's 27 nations, including France, Germany and Spain, expressed concern that the law passed in April allows for fines on people organizing or taking part in Pride events, and the use of facial recognition software to identify them.",
      "\u201cWe are highly alarmed by these developments, which run contrary to the fundamental values of human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights\u201d enshrined in the EU treaties, they said.",
      "They called on the European Commission \u2014 the powerful executive branch that monitors the respect of EU laws \u2014 \u201cto expeditiously make full use of the rule of law toolbox at its disposal in case these measures are not revised accordingly.\u201d",
      "The declaration was published on social media as ministers for EU affairs gathered in Brussels for yet more talks on the way that Hungary\u2019s staunchly nationalist government has introduced legislation that its partners see as undermining rule of law standards.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s time that we consider the next steps, because this is getting pointless in continuing these hearings,\u201d said Jessica Rosencrantz, the EU affairs minister of Sweden, which signed up to the declaration.",
      "Rosencrantz said that the EU is \u201cnot just a geographical union but a union based on values, and in that sense we have to act strongly against countries not living up to our common principles.\u201d",
      "Hungary\u2019s EU affairs minister, J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka, said that the new law has simply been misunderstood.",
      "\u201cThere is no such thing in Hungary as a Pride ban,\u201d B\u00f3ka told reporters. \u201cI hope that after these discussions my colleagues around the table will walk out with a more nuanced view on the Hungarian legislation.\u201d",
      "The constitutional amendment passed in April declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary\u2019s contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "The EU commissioner responsible for democracy, justice and rule of law, Michael McGrath, said that the \u201cwillingness is there\u201d to take action against Hungary. He said that \u201ca comprehensive analysis of the relevant legislation is underway now.\u201d",
      "McGrath also expressed \u201cvery serious concerns\u201d about another piece of draft legislation in Hungary. This bill would allow the government to monitor, restrict, penalize and potentially ban organizations it deems a threat to national sovereignty.",
      "The draft law marks a significant escalation of the government\u2019s long-running crackdown on critical media and nongovernmental organizations.",
      "It would allow Hungary \u2019s contentious Sovereignty Protection Office to identify organizations that influence public debate or voter sentiment in ways it considers detrimental to Hungary\u2019s interests.",
      "\u201cWe believe it is a breach of EU law, including a breach of internal market freedoms and also a breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cWe stand ready to use the tools at our disposal\u201d to oppose it, he added.",
      "As part of its many legal disputes with Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government, the European Commission has deprived Hungary of access to billions of euros in EU funds, in part because of fears that the money may be misused.",
      "\u201cAt this point in time, about 18 billion euros ($20 billion) is not available to Hungary. That\u2019s because of their own rule of law breaches. I wish it were otherwise,\u201d McGrath told reporters.",
      "Despite rosy government projections, Hungary\u2019s economy has for at least two years been in a state of stagnation, partly becaue of the frozen EU funds. Struggling under high inflation, Hungary\u2019s gross domestic product dipped back into negative territory in the first quarter of 2025, the only contraction in the EU.",
      "Hungary has also drifted ever further from the EU fold over the Russia-Ukraine war, repeatedly holding up the passage of multibillion-euro aid packages to Kyiv and sanctions on Moscow. But its European partners are growing more inclined to proceed without Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",

      "King Charles III says Canada is facing unprecedented challenges in a world that\u2019s never been more dangerous",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) \u2014 King Charles III said Canada is facing unprecedented challenges in a world that's never been more dangerous as he opened the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday with a speech widely viewed as a show of support in the face of annexation threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex Canada prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne outlining his government's priorities for the new session of Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cWe must face reality: since the Second World War, our world has never been more dangerous and unstable. Canada is facing challenges that, in our lifetimes, are unprecedented,\" Charles said in French.",
      "He added that \u201cmany Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them.\"",
      "It's rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice before in 1957 and 1977.",
      "Charles, on his 20th visit to Canada, noted that it has been nearly 70 years since his mother first opened Parliament.",
      "\"Canada has dramatically changed: repatriating its constitution, achieving full independence, and witnessing immense growth. Canada has embraced its British, French, and Indigenous roots, and become a bold, ambitious, innovative country that is bilingual, truly multicultural,\u201d the monarch said.",
      "He said when his late mother opened a new session of Canadian Parliament in 1957, World War II remained a fresh, painful memory and said the Cold War was intensifying.",
      "\"Freedom and democracy were under threat,\" he said. \u201cToday, Canada faces another critical moment.\"",
      "The speech isn't written by the king or his U.K. advisers as Charles serves as a nonpartisan head of state. He read what was put before him by Canada\u2019s government, but makes some remarks of his own.",
      "\u201dI have always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values, and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians,\u201d he said.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the United States. The king\u2019s visit clearly underscores Canada\u2019s sovereignty, he said.",
      "Carney won the job of prime minister by promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump and made his first trip as prime minister to London and Paris, the capital cities of Canada's two founding nations.",
      "Carney is eager to diversify trade, and the king said that Canada can build new alliances. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.",
      "The new U.S. ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, said that sending messages to the U.S. isn\u2019t necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that if there\u2019s a message to be sent, there are easier ways to do that, such as calling him or calling the president.",
      "The king said that among the priorities for the government is protection of the French language and Quebec culture, which are at the heart of Canadian identity.",
      "\u201cThey define the country that Canadians, and I, love so much. Canada is a country where official and Indigenous languages \u200b\u200bare respected and celebrated,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said the Canada must protect Quebec's dairy supply management industry. Trump attacked the industry in trade talks.",
      "And he said that the Canadian government will protect Canada\u2019s sovereignty by reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces. Trump has complained that Canadas doesn't spend enough on its military.",
      "The king said that Canada would look to the European Union to purchase military equipment by joining the \"REARM Europe\u201d plan \u2014 a major defence procurement project to ramp up arms production in Europe. The speech made no mention of buying from the U.S.",
      "A horse-drawn carriage tookCharles and Queen Camilla to the Senate of Canada Building for the speech. It was accompanied by 28 horses, 14 before and 14 after. After inspecting a 100-person honor guard and receiving a 21-gun salute, King Charles entered the Senate building as the crowd cheered.",
      "Former Canadian Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau and Stephen Harper were among those in attendance.",
      "The king returned U.K. after the speech and a visit to Canada\u2019s National War Memorial.",
      "Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian, said the king\u2019s visit reminds him of when Queen Elizabeth II opened the Parliament in Grenada, a member of the commonwealth, in 1985.",
      "A U.S.-led force invaded the islands in October 1983 without consulting the British government following the killing of Grenada\u2019s Marxist prime minister, Maurice Bishop.",

      "A Texas oil executive from Elon Musk\u2019s government efficiency team has been tasked with overhauling the federal agency that manages vast tracts of public lands",
      "A Texas oil executive from Elon Musk\u2019s government efficiency team has been given sweeping powers to overhaul the federal department that manages vast tracts of resource-rich public lands, but he hasn't divested his energy investments or filed an ethics commitment to break ties with companies that pose a conflict of interest, records show.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently directed Tyler Hassen, who lacks Senate confirmation and has no public administration experience, to reorganize the Interior Department, which oversees some 70,000 employees in 11 agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.",
      "Before joining DOGE, Hassen spent nearly two decades as an executive at Basin Holdings, an enterprise involved in the manufacture, sale and servicing of oil rigs worldwide. A financial disclosure report obtained by AP shows Hassen made millions annually from these companies, owned by John Fitzgibbons \u2014 an industry giant who is well-connected in Russia.",
      "These and other potential conflicts of interest are compounding the concerns of Democratic lawmakers, conservation groups and environmental advocates, who say Hassen\u2019s appointment appears designed to evade Senate confirmation and oversight while testing the limits of congressional authority.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a dereliction of duty to offload decisions about staffing and funding at the Interior Department to someone who hasn\u2019t even been confirmed by the Senate,\u201d said Kate Groetzinger, with the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation group.",
      "Interior officials didn\u2019t respond to requests to interview Hassen.",
      "Department spokesperson Katie Martin said in an email that Hassen is helping achieve the president\u2019s vision for major changes, and Interior will \u201ccontinue to prioritize retaining first responders, parks services and energy production employees.\u201d",
      "Once inside Interior in January, Hassen reviewed \u201cevery single contract, every single grant,\u201d and sent action items to Burgum, he told FOX News in an April interview. Burgum praised Hassen and DOGE on X, saying they \u201chave identified massive amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse already!\u201d",
      "A draft copy of Interior's new strategic plan includes increasing \u201cclean coal, oil, and gas production through faster permitting\u201d while reducing regulations to \u201cgenerate more revenue from lands and resources for the U.S. Treasury.\u201d",
      "Hassen also has twice filed a notice in the Federal Register extending Trump\u2019s freeze on regulations \u2014 which stops agencies from proposing or issuing new rules \u2014 and removed the opportunity for public comment as \u201ccontrary to the public interest.\u201d The latest extension pushes it to June 4.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how Hassen became involved with Musk. There\u2019s little information about him online. He told FOX News that before DOGE, he was \u201crunning five businesses in Houston.\" He said this work \u201cis me giving back to the country.\u201d",
      "Hassen was an executive at Fitzgibbons-owned Basin Holdings \u2014 the privately held parent company for Basin Energy and Basin Industries \u2014 since 2008. An old Facebook page for Tyler Hassen includes a 2010 photo of him at the \u201cSamotlor Field, Western Siberia - largest oilfield in Russia.\u201d",
      "Hassen\u2019s brother, Todd, is also a Texas energy executive. He's been CEO of Red Wolfpack Resources since 2024 and was with Tellurian, a natural gas company, and EagleStone Resources before that, according to his LinkedIn page.",
      "Burgum named Hassen his assistant secretary for policy, management and budget in March, but changed his title in April to \u201cprincipal deputy assistant secretary.\u201d An assistant secretary requires Senate approval and an ethics commitment to resign positions that would create a conflict of interest. A principal deputy does not.",
      "Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, said Interior officials are committing fraud \u201cby calling someone by a different name so that they don\u2019t have to file a really important document where they explain how they\u2019re going to comply with ethics standards.\u201d",
      "Hassen sought to fire a top department lawyer in April for refusing to give him and other DOGE officials access to a highly sensitive personnel database as he pushed for massive department-wide staff reductions through buyouts, early retirements and layoffs. Hassen wrote that Tony Irish, an associate solicitor, was \u201csubverting, obstructing and delaying the process\" and should be removed for misconduct.",
      "Irish is on leave while appealing the firing and is represented by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. \u201cIn seeking to remove Tony Irish, Tyler Hassen has demonstrated his own unfitness for federal service,\u201d PEER executive director Tim Whitehouse said in a press release. \u201cThis type of corporate bullying is not how the people\u2019s business is supposed to be conducted.\u201d",
      "Jacob Malcom, a former Interior Department executive, said Burgum's order directing Hassen to make \u201cappropriate funding decisions\u201d for administrative changes and ensure \u201cthe appropriate transfer of funds, programs, records and property\" is unconstitutional \u2014 Congress appropriates funds, not assistant secretaries.",
      "\u201cUnless Congress has explicitly authorized those funds to be moved, they can\u2019t actually transfer the funds,\u201d Malcom said. \u201cThat\u2019s just flat out illegal.\u201d",
      "Although Hassen didn't file a divestment commitment, he did file a financial disclosure in February \u2014 revised five times, the most recent dated April 21 \u2014 revealing he made almost $4 million annually from Fitzgibbon's oilfield services companies. Hassen said he sold his equity in these companies and is being paid in installments through June 2026.",
      "Hassen reported that he holds $50,001 to $100,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon\u2019s company Block Harvest, a cryptocurrency mining business that uses flared natural gas to run data centers. He reported owning $250,000 to $500,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon\u2019s Global Guardian, a security company.",
      "Hassen also declared 254 stock holdings, including cryptocurrency, tobacco, foreign banking and between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock each in Archrock, a Houston company that specializes in natural gas compression services; WEC Energy Group, which holds electric and natural gas companies and Quanta Services, which is involved in pipelines and pumping.",
      "He's got a similar stake in Albemarle Corp., which owns the Silver Peak lithium mine in Nevada \u2014 the nation's only active lithium source. It's currently seeking authorization from Interior's Bureau of Land Management to expand its operations.",
      "Hassen\u2019s potential conflicts of interest have raised concerns among environmental groups and some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "He\u2019s attempting to remove regulations constraining the fossil fuel industries, said Josh Axelrod, a senior policy advocate with the National Resources Defense Council. \u201cAs a member of those industries, he\u2019s uniquely qualified to flag the ones they don\u2019t like.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, the ranking Democrats on Interior's Senate and House oversight subcommittees, have demanded a stop to Hassen's large-scale reorganization.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told Burgum in a May 7 letter that \u201cdelegating sweeping authorities and responsibilities to a non-Senate confirmed person in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act is baffling and extremely troubling.\u201d",

      "YOKOSUKA, Japan -- Money-losing Japanese automaker Nissan is banking on its latest \u201ce-Power\u201d technology for a turnaround.",
      "A kind of hybrid, e-Power comes equipped with both an electric motor and gasoline engine, much like the Toyota Motor Corp. Prius. It\u2019s different from a Prius in that it doesn\u2019t switch back and forth between the motor and engine during the drive.",
      "That means the car always is running on its EV battery, ensuring a quiet, smooth ride.",
      "\u201cNissan has a proud history of pioneering innovative technology that set us apart,\u201d Chief Technology Officer Eiichi Akashi told reporters on the sidelines of a test drive at its Grandrive course outside Tokyo.",
      "The advantage of e-Power vehicles is that they never need to be charged like EVs do. The owner just fuels up at a gas station and the car never runs out of a charge.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp., which racked up a $4.5 billion loss for the fiscal year through March, sorely needs a hot-seller, especially in the lucrative North American market. But the U.S. market is proving a big headache for all the Japanese automakers because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",
      "To achieve a turnaround, Nissan is working on reducing costs, strengthening business partnerships and redefining its lineup. That's where e-Power fits in, according to Akashi.",
      "Yokohama-based Nissan announced earlier this month that it\u2019s slashing about 15% of its global work force, or about 20,000 employees, and reducing the number of its auto plants to 10 from 17, under an ambitious recovery plan led by its new Chief Executive Ivan Espinosa.",
      "Nissan officials did not give a price for the upcoming e-Power models. The only other automaker offers a similar technology is \u201ckei,\u201d or tiny car manufacturer Suzuki Motor Corp.",
      "E-Power is already offered on the Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail model in Europe, and the Note in Japan. The upgraded version will be offered in the new Rogue in the U.S.",
      "Nissan, a pioneer in EVs with its Leaf, which went on sale in 2010, is also preparing beefed up EV models. It's also working on a solid-state battery which is expected to replace the lithium-ion batteries now widely used in hybrids, EVs and e-Power models.",
      "Analysts say Nissan is in danger of running out of cash and needs a partner. Speculation is rife its Yokohama headquarters building will get sold, or one of its Japan plants will be turned into a casino.",
      "Nissan started talks last year with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. for a business integration but announced in February that it was dropping the talks.",

      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim says Southeast Asian nations will forge a common front to face challenges including economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs and the four-year deadly civil war in Myanmar",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Southeast Asian nations will forge a common front to face challenges including economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs and a four-year civil war in Myanmar, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday.",
      "Opening an annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Anwar said he has sought a unified bloc meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss the tariffs. Officials are hopeful it could happen later this year. Malaysia is the current chair of ASEAN.",
      "\u201cFor ASEAN, our peace, stability and prosperity have often depended on an open, inclusive, rules-based international order... These foundations are now being dismantled under the force of arbitrary action,\" Anwar said.",
      "ASEAN, which has agreed to avoid retaliatory measures, has formed a taskforce to coordinate a response to the U.S. tariffs in parallel with bilateral negotiations by some member countries, Anwar said. ASEAN members include bigger economies such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.",
      "The region relies on exports to the U.S. and is hurt by the Trump administration's tariffs, which range from 10% for Singapore to as high as 49% for Cambodia. Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs in April for most of the world, and this month struck a similar deal with key rival China, easing trade war tensions.",
      "Anwar said an ASEAN leaders' meeting on Tuesday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 the first such tripartite meeting \u2014 would spur new cooperation that could help insulate ASEAN's economy. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "ASEAN leaders later Monday will launch a new 20-year vision to deepen their economic and social integration, Anwar said.",
      "Analysts said China, which is ASEAN's top trading partner, wants to expand its influence by presenting itself as a reliable ally in the region. But tensions persist over Beijing's aggressive stance in the disputed South China Sea that has led to frequent clashes especially with the Philippines.",
      "Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told the ASEAN summit that a \"code of conduct\u201d being negotiated by ASEAN and China to govern the busy sea passage must be binding \u2014 one of the factors that has hampered talks.",
      "\u201cWe underscore the urgent need to accelerate the adoption of a legally binding code of conduct in the South China Sea to safeguard maritime rights, promote stability and prevent miscalculations at sea,\u201d he said.",
      "On the Myanmar crisis, Anwar said Malaysia has managed to \u201cmove the needle forward\u201d after forming an informal advisory group headed by former Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra. Anwar met last month with Myanmar military chief Gen. Ming Aung Hlaing in Bangkok and held virtual talks with the opposition National Unity Government.",
      "Officials said the current emphasis on aid delivery following a March earthquake that killed 3,700 people could eventually pave the way for peace talks. But critics accuse the army of violating a self-proclaimed ceasefire with dozens of airstrikes, with aid not freely allowed into areas not under the army\u2019s control.",
      "The Myanmar war, which has killed thousands and displaced millions, is a challenge to ASEAN since refugees have fled across borders to neighboring nations. The region has also seen rising transnational crimes and cybercrimes. The bloc has made little headway after the Myanmar military refused to comply with its peace plan, including a ceasefire, delivery of humanitarian aid and negotiations.",
      "Anwar said more engagement is being planned in Myanmar.",
      "\u201cQuiet engagement matters. The steps may be small and the bridge may be fragile but as they say: In matters of peace, even a fragile bridge is better than a widening gulf,\u201d Anwar said.",
      "Thomas Daniel from Malaysia's Institute of Strategic and International Studies said ASEAN has no real leverage to push for reconciliation. The Myanmar military has reportedly lost control of a large part of the country, making the situation even more challenging.",
      "\u201cThe conditions on the ground are extremely difficult. I don\u2019t think we have reached a stage where ASEAN can facilitate any kind of political dialogue between conflicting parties. They are not ready for that yet,\u201d he said.",

      "Nothing less than the future of college sports is being hashed this week at the Southeastern Conference\u2019s annual spring meetings in Florida",
      "MIRAMAR BEACH, Fla. -- Nothing less than the future of college sports is being hashed this week out in conference rooms spread throughout a sprawling seaside resort in Florida.",
      "These are the Southeastern Conference's annual spring meetings \u2014 a gathering of school presidents, athletic directors and coaches. It might be argued that the 2025 affair carries more weight than it ever has.",
      "Among the topics are the future of the College Football Playoff, the SEC's own schedule, the transfer portal and the NCAA itself. All are influenced by the fate of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit settlement that hovers over almost every corner of college athletics.",
      "As a reminder of what's at stake, a handful of football coaches detailed the uncertainties they faced with the start of practice closing in, one of which is still not knowing how many players they'll be able to suit up for the upcoming season.",
      "\u201cIt's challenging when you're trying to figure out what you can do for football camp on July 30th, when we really don't have much of a resolution of what that's going to look like,\u201d Texas A&M coach Mike Elko said.",
      "Some of the topics being discussed this week and the SEC's role in sorting them out:",
      "The SEC and Big Ten will decide whether to expand the CFP from 12 to 14 or 16 teams, and will ultimately have the final say on how many automatic bids they and other conferences will receive. Among the proposals is one in which those two conferences would receive four automatic bid, and another that allots one automatic bid to five conferences and 11 at-large slots.",
      "\u201cThe best system with 16 should be the 16 best,\u201d said Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin, a critic of the system last year when his team was left out of the first 12-team field. \u201cI don't know exactly how that's figured out\u201d",
      "The Big 12 and Atlantic Coast conferences, which are the other two members of the Power Four, will be able to offer their input \u2014 but that's all it is \u2014 along with the rest of the smaller conferences who are involved in the CFP structure.",
      "Asked about the relationship with his fellow commissioners, the SEC's Greg Sankey relayed a recent conversation he had with one of his predecessors, Roy Kramer, who had his share of contentious arguments with leaders of other conferences.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019d walk out of some of those rooms, and we weren't going to talk to each other for a year. We hated each other, but we always figured a way out,'\" Sankey said. \u201cI take great comfort in that. And I take the responsibility to figure that out.\u201d",
      "At stake is not only what the six seasons starting in 2026 will look like, but \u2014 if the SEC and Big Ten create an unrepairable rift with the other Power Four leagues \u2014 what college football might become once ESPN's $7.8 billion contract to televise the games ends after the 2031 season.",
      "The SEC's decision on whether to add a ninth league game and a possible shift from a conference title game to a series of \u201cplay-in\u201d games for newly created automatic qualifying spots are also related to the CFP's next format.",
      "If only there weren't that little problem of the \u201cstudent\u201d in \u201cstudent-athlete,\u201d some of the decisions about the transfer portal would be so much simpler.",
      "Because schools try to sync the timing of the window when players can leave one school for another with the academic calendar, football finds itself having to choose between a window that opens during the playoff \u2014 around the time the spring semester kicks off \u2014 or one that opens in the spring and predates the fall semester.",
      "The playoff option might be more convenient for some coaches, who could build their roster and do offseason workouts with those players from January through the spring. But that could lead to a repeat of some of the awkward moves from last season, with players on teams contending for a title leaving for better offers.",
      "\u201cIt's really hard to be playing in a championship setting and have to be dealing with that,\u201d Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. \u201cWhen I brought that up as a complaint or a problem, it was told to me, \u2018There\u2019s no crying from a yacht.'\u201d",
      "Ultimately, members of the American Football Coaches Association agreed that January is the way to go. The NCAA will ultimately make this decision, likely with heavy input from the new entity being formed by the Power Four conferences that will run key aspects of college sports.",
      "Most people at these meetings agree that the SEC isn't looking to break away from the NCAA completely.",
      "Then again, Sankey said, \"I\u2019ve shared with the decision-making working group (at the NCAA) that I have people in my room asking, \u2018Why are we still in the NCAA?\u2019\u201d",
      "This has lent urgency to the proposals being considered for even more autonomy for the Power Four, who are looking to streamline decision-making and put the most important topics \u2014 finances, litigation and infractions not related to the settlement \u2014 in their hands.",
      "The current proposal for a slimmed-down board of directors would give the four biggest conferences enough voting power to total 65% of the vote even if the other nine board members all disagreed. It does not give the Power Four enough voting power to pass a measure if one of the four dissents.",
      "That might not be enough.",
      "\u201cI think 68% is a number that's been on our mind, because you can't just have someone walk away at that level among four and everything stops,\u201d Sankey said of a formula that would give three of four conferences the voting power to pass legislation. \u201cWe need to talk through those things in depth.\"",

      "He's been taking pain-killing and anti-inflammatory pills the past several weeks, and did so again Wednesday. But Ruud said the knee began bothering him in the first set against Borges, who is ranked 41st and became the first Portuguese man to get to the French Open's third round.",
      "Ruud said the worst shot for his knee is an open-stance backhand, in which he slides on his left foot, so he's been avoiding it in practice.",
      "\u201cCertain movements out there are kind of what makes it painful. Certain shots are painful to do. When you\u2019re playing matches, you can\u2019t really control it in the same way (as in practice). You do everything you can to get to every ball,\u201d said Ruud, who also reached the final at the 2022 U.S. Open. \u201cSometimes you kind of forget that this is a shot I shouldn\u2019t go for.\u201d",
      "He was visited by a trainer and took some pills during Wednesday's match, but nothing seemed to help.",
      "\u201cIt's a Slam. I love this tournament,\" Ruud said. \"Looking back, I tried my best to continue (and tried) to avoid the shots that are hurting. But towards the end, there were also other movements that started hurting, so it wasn\u2019t ideal.\u201d",
      "He said the problems began in his first clay event of the pre-French Open stretch, at Monte Carlo in April, and that he had medical exams a couple of weeks later in Madrid \u2014 where he went on to win the title. Ruud pulled out of the Geneva Open, which was played last week.",
      "Now he'll have more tests done.",
      "\u201cI took five days completely off at home. It wasn\u2019t enough to make the pain go away,\u201d Ruud said. \u201cI wish I could stay here longer.\u201d",
      "Both defending champions were in action at Court Philippe-Chatrier. Carlos Alcaraz overcame a one-set blip to defeat Fabian Marozsan 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, and Iga Swiatek met 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu later. Other women's winners included 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini, Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen and 18-year-old Canadian qualifier Victoria Mboko, while Olympic silver medalist and Wimbledon semifinalist Donna Vekic lost to unseeded American Bernarda Pera 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (10-3). Men advancing included No. 8 Lorenzo Musetti and No. 25 Alexei Popyrin.",
      "The second round concludes with 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic taking on France's Corentin Moutet in Court Suzanne-Lenglen in a match that could feature a raucous atmosphere. French fans are likely to make a lot of noise at Court Philippe-Chatrier, too, because another one of their own, Richard Gasquet, could be playing the final match of his career when he takes on No. 1 Jannik Sinner. At night in Chatrier, No. 5 Jack Draper of Britain takes on yet another French veteran, Gael Monfils. No. 2-seeded Coco Gauff, against Tereza Valentova, and No. 3 Jessica Pegula, against Ann Li in an all-American match, are among the top women in action, along with No. 6 Mirra Andreeva against Ashlyn Krueger of the United States.",

      "LONDON -- Abbi Pulling never thought so many people would want to watch her chase her Formula 1 dream.",
      "Following on from \u201cDrive To Survive,\" which sparked a boom in F1's audience through its mix of on-track action and behind-the-scenes insight, \u201cF1: The Academy\u201d debuts on Netflix on Wednesday. It's set to bring unprecedented attention to a women's-only racing series.",
      "The documentary is \u201ca huge opportunity,\u201d said Pulling, a 22-year-old British driver whose run to the 2024 title forms the backbone of the series. The series follows F1 Academy, a competition which can make or break careers and runs as a support series to F1 Grand Prix races.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed my life and helped my career progress,\u201d Pulling told The Associated Press. \u201cLittle 8-year-old me that started karting definitely would never have imagined how it\u2019s all exploded and become so big.\"",
      "Operating a women-only racing series has been controversial among some F1 fans. Mocking, even abusive, social media comments are part of the scenery for the series and its drivers.",
      "For the drivers, it offers funding and an opportunity to build a brand. Pulling, who's shown sharing a house with her manager, says she couldn't have afforded to keep racing if not for F1 Academy, or to continue for 2025 if not for winning the title.",
      "There are also subtle ways the atmosphere in F1 Academy is different. \u201cNo friends on track\u201d is the title of the opening episode of the docuseries, but the drivers are a close-knit group off the circuit. To an audience accustomed to the F1 feuds of \u201cDrive To Survive,\u201d seeing drivers consoling each other after mistakes and organizing birthday parties is a little different.",
      "\u201cAs a woman, it\u2019s like you go in there, you have your own safe space,\u201d said Bianca Bustamante, a driver from the Philippines.",
      "F1 Academy is part of a wider culture shift in auto racing. In 2018, F1 abolished the role of \u201cgrid girls\u201d \u2014 models paid to stand in front of drivers' cars \u2014 and while auto racing remains male-dominated, teams increasingly employ more women in engineering and strategy roles.",
      "\u201cFive, 10 years ago ... the motorsport world, community, was very, very different,\" Bustamante told AP. \"The only time girls were ever on the grid was if they were grid girls, or umbrella girls, or podium girls. All these things that we don\u2019t see nowadays because of the representation.\u201d",
      "No female driver has started an F1 world championship race for 49 years, or even entered qualifying since 1992, and the last woman to take part in an official F1 session was Susie Wolff in British Grand Prix practice in 2015. Wolff is now the managing director of F1 Academy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lived it. I know how tough it is,\u201d Wolff told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to set something up which gives young female drivers opportunity for the future, and from start to end I think we\u2019ve made a huge amount of progress so far in a very short space of time.\u201d",
      "F1 Academy uses modified Formula 4 cars, meaning that even the series' best drivers have multiple more steps to reach the F1 grid. While it may take years to develop a female driver through F1's ultra-competitive feeder series, Wolff says that's not the only goal.",
      "Helping a driver launch a sustainable long-term racing career in any series is a win for F1 Academy, Wolff argues, and so is encouraging more girls to start out in go-kart events or join the increasing numbers of female engineers in F1.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much more welcoming now, compared to how it was when I started back in 2001,\u201d says Alice Powell, who mentors girls in karting series, alongside being Pulling's manager and a development driver in the Formula E all-electric series. She says she's seeing more girls starting out at the grassroots in Britain, and they're having more success too.",
      "\u201cFemale drivers are much more accepted. There are a lot more female drivers in the karting paddock, which is really nice to see. A lot more female mechanics are getting involved and helping the younger drivers as well.\u201d",
      "It's not always easy to follow what F1 Academy winners do next.",
      "The unprecedented attention on F1 Academy compared to other development series means that moving up means leaving the spotlight \u2014 at least for now.",
      "Pulling's reward for winning the title was a fully-funded seat in the British-based GB3 series this year. That costs far more than Pulling could have paid and gives her a much faster car, but has a fraction of F1 Academy's audience.",
      "Bustamante, who uses her social media influencer skills to keep her career moving, has also raised the funds to join Pulling in GB3, while other ex-F1 Academy drivers like 2023 champion Marta Garcia have moved into sportscar racing.",
      "Drivers get a maximum two years in F1 Academy, with their costs heavily subsidized by F1. The vast costs of auto racing \u2014 which only increase as the cars get more expensive and powerful \u2014 mean that failure in F1 Academy could easily end a career.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t shy away from the harsh realities of sport,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cSo failure will become part of the journey for many drivers who are not racing at the front.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- After hitting a two-run shot for the New York Mets on Tuesday night, Jared Young was reminded it was his first major league homer in 613 days.",
      "\u201cFelt that long, yeah,\" he said. \"It's the best league in the world, so you\u2019ve got to play your best to be here and have success here. But I\u2019m glad to be back, and that one felt good.\u201d",
      "Called up from the minors Saturday after spending part of last season in South Korea, the 29-year-old from Canada helped power the Mets to a 6-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox.",
      "Young gave New York a 4-2 lead in the first inning with a drive over the right-field fence that marked his third career longball and first in the big leagues since Sept. 22, 2023, for the Chicago Cubs against Colorado.",
      "He also delivered a well-struck double to right-center that set up Jeff McNeil's sacrifice fly in the third, giving Young multiple extra-base hits for the first time in his 26 major league games.",
      "\u201cHe looked great. He\u2019s been having really good at-bats and I felt like tonight you really got to see what he\u2019s able to do,\" said Mets slugger Pete Alonso, who launched a two-run homer of his own two batters before Young connected.",
      "\"He's a great guy to have. Not only is he a great performer but I mean, the couple days that he\u2019s been here, he\u2019s been a really good teammate. So, he\u2019s been a treat to have so far.\u201d",
      "With designated hitter Jesse Winker (also a left-handed batter) on the injured list, the Mets brought up Young from Triple-A Syracuse to face a string of right-handed starters over the past few days.",
      "He's started four games in a row and impressed manager Carlos Mendoza with the way he controls the strike zone \u2014 but Young's home run Tuesday was his first hit for New York.",
      "\u201cLook, he\u2019s getting an opportunity,\" Mendoza said. \"He\u2019s back in the big leagues after a lot of grinding. Whether it\u2019s minor leagues, up and down, going overseas, he's getting an opportunity back here in the States, and here we are giving him a chance and he\u2019s taking advantage of it. Like I said, I like the at-bats and it was good to see him get some results today.\u201d",
      "Young played at small schools in Oklahoma (Connors State College) and North Dakota (Minot State University) before getting selected by the Cubs in the 15th round of the 2017 amateur draft from Old Dominion in Virginia.",
      "He made his major league debut with Chicago in September 2022 and got 47 plate appearances in 2023. Young was then claimed off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals and played 74 games at Triple-A Memphis last year before getting released on July 30.",
      "So he signed with the Doosan Bears in South Korea and batted .326 with 10 homers and 39 RBIs over 38 games in the KBO \u2014 where he was teammates with Mets left-hander Brandon Waddell, another international success story.",
      "New York signed Young last December and sent him to Syracuse, where he began the season on the injured list.",
      "But once he got healthy, he pounded Triple-A pitching, batting .259 with a .393 on-base percentage and .533 slugging percentage. He had five homers, five doubles, 21 RBIs and 12 walks in 22 games before being called up.",
      "\u201cYou believe in yourself and you believe in the player that you are, I feel like it takes care of a lot of things,\u201d Young said. \"There\u2019s going to be a lot of ups and downs in kind of any career \u2014 I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s playing baseball, or doing anything. But I think when you believe in yourself you can get to where you want to get.\u201d",
      "Asked how he's been feeling at the plate in the majors, Young said: \u201cPretty comfortable.\"",
      "\u201cTrying to keep things as similar as possible to all the baseball you\u2019ve played, whether in the minors or the big leagues, wherever you are,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou know, just put good at-bats and be a tough out.\u201d",
      "He certainly was Tuesday night, hitting sixth in a dangerous Mets lineup that features some of baseball's biggest stars in Alonso, Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor.",
      "\u201cIt's awesome. It\u2019s great,\u201d Young said. \"You take a look at this team from the top down, I mean, pretty good ballplayers and winning a lot of games. So, to get thrown into it, I feel like I belong and I feel like it\u2019s a good spot and a good fit, and hope we can just keep winning some ballgames.\u201d",

      "In all sports, there are advantages to being at home",
      "PARIS -- In all sports, there are advantages to being at home. At the French Open tennis tournament, being a visitor playing against a French player can feel as though the whole world is against you.",
      "The crowds don't just cheer. They boo, they whistle, they make noise between serves, they hurl insults \u2014 and, at least once, even gum \u2014 at the locals' opponents. That sort of behavior is why the tournament organizers banned alcohol from the stands last year, a policy still in place.",
      "Some of the non-French athletes who deal with that sort of negativity in Paris, such as 19-year-old Jakub Mens\u00edk of the Czech Republic, who eliminated Alexandre M\u00fcller in front of a rowdy crowd at Court 14 on Tuesday, compare the high-intensity atmosphere to that of a soccer game.",
      "Others choose stronger terms.",
      "\u201cDisgusting. Worst experience of my life,\u201d was what Nicol\u00e1s Jarry of Chile said this week when asked to think back to last year's rowdy loss at Court Simonne-Mathieu to France's Corentin Moutet, whose coach had implored the spectators to make life \u201chell\u201d for Jarry after the two had a contentious meeting in Santiago earlier in the season.",
      "Jarry blamed that on Moutet, saying that everything was calmer during his loss Monday to another Frenchman, Arthur Fils, whom the Chilean called a \u201cgood guy\u201d and a \u201cgentleman.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's a battle out there, you know. Sometimes, it\u2019s not just a battle with the player,\u201d said Novak Djokovic, who is scheduled to face the irrepressible Moutet in the second round Thursday.",
      "Expect an antagonistic atmosphere. Djokovic sure does.",
      "\u201cThey're going to have the crowd on their side. It\u2019s nothing strange about it. It\u2019s expected,\u201d the 24-time Grand Slam champion said. \u201cBut it is true that here in France and in Paris, comparing to other Slams, the people are louder and more passionate and just give more support, louder support, more energy to their player, which for some (opponents) can be annoying. It\u2019s not the kind of ideal environment you want to be playing in, but you have to be ready for it.\u201d",
      "So much for the supposed silence usually found in a tennis arena. It all raises questions about where the line between support and incivility lies.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stepped up security,\" tournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, a former No. 1 player, said before this year's event, \"and given chair umpires greater power to intervene and report unacceptable behavior in the stands.\u201d",
      "For Mens\u00edk on Tuesday, the jeers began every time he hit the ball during the warmup ahead of his 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-3 win over France's M\u00fcller. More arrived once play began, accompanying each of his 20 aces or just when he simply walked to check a ball mark \u2014 a routine part of clay-court tennis.",
      "After taking the third set, Mens\u00edk gave the boo birds a little bit back, waving his right index finger as if it were a baton conducting an orchestra, a move he learned from Djokovic.",
      "\u201cSometimes,\u201d Mens\u00edk said of the crowd, \u201cit is too far.\u201d",
      "Still, there are those who shrug it all off.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of tennis, especially here. My opponent had her fans here; I have mine in Belgium. It\u2019s normal,\" said Elise Mertens, the 24th-seeded Belgian who was a semifinalist at the 2018 Australian Open and lost Tuesday to Lois Boisson of France at Court 14. \u201cFans were loud but not insulting. I didn\u2019t feel any particular hostility.\u201d",
      "There are two sides to the loud backing French players receive.",
      "It \u201cmakes you feel like you could reach for the stars,\u201d said the highest-ranked French woman, Varvara Gracheva, who acknowledged that support also can become a burden.",
      "She lost in the first round Tuesday.",
      "It's been a quarter of a century since a woman representing the host nation won the singles title at the French Open ( Mary Pierce in 2000) and even longer since a man did ( Yannick Noah in 1983).",
      "\u201cAs French players, we\u2019re under pressure all the time when we play here\u201d said Moutet, currently ranked No. 73. \u201cWhen you lose, you \u2018suck.\u2019 When you win, you\u2019re \u2018King of the World.\u2019 So you have to try to ignore the pressure.\u201d",
      "Nathan Fhima, an 18-year-old high school student from Paris, figured his compatriots needed his voice. So there he was this week at Roland-Garros, waving a blue-white-and-red French flag and screaming himself hoarse while skipping class to watch qualifying and first-round matches.",
      "\u201cWe have to push them, because not much will happen otherwise,\u201d he said after watching France's Diane Parry lose Monday. \u201cMaybe that noise will lift a homegrown champion to victory again. We have to believe.\u201d",

      "Astronomers have discovered a strange new object in our Milky Way galaxy",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered a strange new object in our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it\u2019s shooting out radio waves. What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University\u2019s Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \u201csomething exotic\u201d and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\u201cWhile our discovery doesn\u2019t yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\u201d Wang said. \u201cEither we are uncovering something entirely new, or we\u2019re seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we\u2019ve never observed before.\u201d",
      "Launched in 1999, Chandra orbits tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth, observing some of the hottest, high-energy objects in the universe.",

      "SpaceX has launched its Starship mega rocket again after back-to-back explosions",
      "After back-to-back explosions, SpaceX launched its mega rocket Starship again on Tuesday evening, but fell short of the main objectives when the spacecraft tumbled out of control and broke apart.",
      "The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.",
      "CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced \u201ca rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or burst apart. \u201cTeams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,\u201d the company said in an online statement.",
      "Musk noted in a post on X it was a \u201cbig improvement\u201d from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.",
      "It was the first time one of Musk's Starships \u2014 intended for moon and Mars travel \u2014 flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.",
      "Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.",
      "\u201cNot looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\u201d said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield during a controlled reentry.",
      "Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.",
      "The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.",
      "Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft\u2019s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.",
      "NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship \u2014 the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built \u2014 in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year\u2019s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan said Tuesday it plans to use some slightly radioactive soil stored near the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant on flower beds outside Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s office to show it is safe to reuse.",
      "The soil was removed from across the Fukushima prefecture as part of decontamination work following the 2011 nuclear disaster and has since been in interim storage. Some of it has since reached levels safe enough for reuse, officials say.",
      "Using the soil at Ishiba's office in Tokyo is aimed at reassuring the public it is safe. The government said that it plans to reuse the soil for flower beds and other purposes within the grounds of government agencies. The plan is based on guidelines set by the Environment Ministry in March and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "The Fukushima disaster resulted in large amounts of radioactive materials spewing out from the plant, polluting surrounding areas.",
      "Japan is stuck with large volumes of the dirt, chopped trees and other debris collected during intensive decontamination work. It has 14 million cubic meters of dirt and other materials \u2014 enough to fill 11 baseball stadiums \u2014 stored at a sprawling outdoor facility straddling the towns of Futaba and Okuma, near the Fukushima plant.",
      "The government is aiming to find disposal sites for the soil by 2045, with officials suggesting low risk material could be used to build roads and in other public works projects across the country.",
      "The Environment Ministry said that the soil will be used as foundation material and safely covered with top soil thick enough to keep radiation at negligible levels.",
      "But there is much public unease. The government has already been forced to discontinue a plan to experiment using some of the soil in flower beds at several public parks in and around Tokyo following protests.",
      "The IAEA is providing assistance with the Fukushima decommissioning process, which requires removing more than 880 tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "In 2023 Japan began discharging treated radioactive wastewater from the plant into the sea to reduce the risk of accidental leaks and to make space to build facilities needed for melted fuel removal.",

      "Scientists have pinpointed the oldest known evidence of humans making tools from whale bone",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have pinpointed the oldest known evidence of humans making tools from whale bone.",
      "The bones, fashioned into narrow projectiles for hunting, had been uncovered in excavations dating back over a century in the Bay of Biscay near Spain and France. Scientists figured the tools were quite ancient, but many were small fragments so it was hard to determine their age.",
      "Technological advancements in the past decade have now made it possible to date the oldest of the tools to about 20,000 years ago. Scientists found that the bones came from blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales and other species.",
      "\u201cHumans and whales have clearly been encountering one another for a long time,\u201d said Vicki Szabo with Western Carolina University, who studies the history of whaling and was not involved with the latest research.",
      "Scientists think that ancient humans were crafting whale bone instruments in places including the Arctic and South Pacific. There\u2019s been solid evidence of whale bone tools dating back to about 5,000 years ago, but the new research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications pushes the timeline back.",
      "Ancient humans weren't necessarily hunting whales, said study author Jean-Marc Petillon with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. More likely, they were scavenging the bodies of beached whales and fashioning their dense, heavy bones into tools to hunt reindeer or bison.",
      "The tools indicate that ancient people in the area took advantage of resources near the sea for survival. They likely also collected seashells and fished. Finding such evidence has been difficult as rising sea levels disrupt coastlines across the globe, scientists said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more contribution to the importance of coastal environments for human groups, even in this long past,\" said Petillon.",

      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

      "But today that system is being shaken.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.",
      "The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation\u2019s by 55%.",

      "It\u2019s too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.",
      "Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous \u2014 and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world\u2019s leading funder of R&D \u2014 including government, university and private investment \u2014 for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world\u2019s R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school\u2019s ability to enroll international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of \u201cperpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 policies.\u2019\u201d Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school\u2019s research mission.",
      "Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step.",
      "The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States.",
      "Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week.",
      "However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S.",
      "No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity.",
      "Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students.",
      "Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze.",
      "The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. Doing so would strike at the school's ability to fundraise, as wealthy donors often give to tax-exempt institutions to lower their own tax burdens.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers working for Russian military intelligence targeted Western technology and logistics companies involved in shipping assistance to Ukraine, the U.S. National Security Agency said.",
      "The hackers were trying to obtain details about the type of assistance entering Ukraine and, as part of the effort, sought access to the feeds of internet-connected cameras near Ukrainian border crossings, according to the NSA's report on the cyberattack, which was issued late Wednesday.",
      "The cyber campaign sought to penetrate defense, transportation and logistics companies in several Western countries, including the U.S., as well as ports, airports and rail systems. The report didn\u2019t specify which types of aid Russia was surveilling, but Ukraine\u2019s allies have contributed significant amounts of military and humanitarian assistance since the war began.",
      "More than 10,000 internet-connected cameras were targeted, including private devices and public traffic cameras near critical transportation points, such as ports, rail hubs or border crossings. Most were in Ukraine, though some were in Romania, Poland and other eastern or central European countries.",
      "Officials did not disclose details about the hackers' success or how long they remained unnoticed. The activity detailed in the report began in 2022, the same year that Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "Russia is expected to continue its efforts to spy on aid shipments, and companies involved in aid logistics or shipments should be on guard, according to the report, which was issued jointly by the NSA, the FBI and security agencies in several allied nations.",
      "\u201cTo defend against and mitigate these threats, at-risk entities should anticipate targeting,\u201d the NSA said.",
      "Authorities linked the activity to a Russian military intelligence unit dubbed \u201cFancy Bear\u201d that is well known for its past campaigns targeting the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The hackers used a variety of tactics to gain access, including spearphishing, which involves sending authentic-looking messages to a potential victim that contain links to harmful software or requests for sensitive information.",
      "The Russian team also exploited security vulnerabilities in computer devices used at small and in-home offices, networks that often lack the security measures found in larger systems.",
      "The hackers didn't use particularly innovative techniques, according to Grant Geyer, chief strategy officer at the cybersecurity company Claroty. Nevertheless, the sprawling yet carefully orchestrated effort gives the Russians a \u201cgranular understanding\u201d of the aid sent to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cThey have done detailed targeting across the entire supply chain to understand what equipment is moving, when and how \u2014 whether it\u2019s by aircraft, ship or rail,\u201d Geyer said.",
      "Russia could use the information it obtained to hone its war planning, Geyer said, or to plot further cyber or physical attacks on the supply chain to Ukraine.",
      "Last fall, U.S. intelligence officials issued a public bulletin directing American defense companies and suppliers to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.",

      "The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they\u2019re worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices.",
      "Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it\u2019s giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world.",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:",
      "The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency\u2019s still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn\u2019t rely on a third party \u2013 like a government or financial institution \u2013 for transactions.",
      "Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin more effectively.",
      "Central to bitcoin\u2019s technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what\u2019s known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining.",
      "In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.",
      "In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.",
      "\u201cI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.",
      "Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.",
      "\u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d he wrote.",
      "But the next day, Hanyecz said he\u2019d successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John\u2019s pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d",
      "\u201cA great milestone reached,\u201d said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz.",
      "It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.",
      "By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.",
      "\u201cI mean people can say I\u2019m stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,\u201d Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have known it would take off like this.\u201d",
      "Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.",
      "\u201cIt made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,\u201d Hanyecz said on the television show \u201c60 minutes.\u201d",
      "Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.",
      "After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn\u2019t taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value.",
      "Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning \u2014 a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",

    "story": [
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said it downed 296 Ukrainian drones overnight.",
      "LONDON -- A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that President Donald Trump \"is not getting enough information\" about Moscow's war on Ukraine, after Trump criticized Putin for his apparent reluctance to pursue a peace deal and warned that the Kremlin was \"playing with fire.\"",
      "\"There is a lot that Trump says, we read it all, track it, but in many ways we come to the conclusion that Trump is not getting enough information about what is really happening in the context of the Ukrainian-Russian confrontation,\" Yuri Ushakov said in an interview with Russian propagandist Pavel Zarubin published on Wednesday.",
      "\"In particular, he is not being informed enough about what massive terrorist attacks are being carried out by Ukraine against peaceful Russian cities,\" Ushakov said. \"Trump only knows what countermeasures we are taking, and he does not fully understand that we are attacking military institutions or military industrial complexes.\"",
      "The comments came after hundreds of Ukrainian drones crossed into Russia overnight into Wednesday morning, dozens of which targeted Moscow and again caused disruption to flights in and out of the capital, according to officials there.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces shot down 296 Ukrainian drones over 12 regions -- including the capital Moscow -- during the latest round of long-range strikes.",
      "Moscow Governor Andrei Vorobyov said on Telegram that at least 42 drones were downed over the region. Vorobyov reported damage to three homes in the town of Chekhov around 40 miles south of the capital.",
      "Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport -- one of four international airports in the capital -- also warned travelers of delays due to flight restrictions imposed during the latest drone attack. Recent weeks have seen regular disruptions to Moscow's airports during such strikes.",
      "Andriy Kovalenko, the head of the Counter-Disinformation Center operating as part of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said on Telegram there were \"some pretty good hits\" during Tuesday night's attack.",
      "Among the targets were the Dubna Machine-Building Plant -- involved in the production of aviation, missile and drone technology, Kovalenko said -- in the city of Dubna, around 70 miles north of Moscow.",
      "Kovalenko said the Technopark ELMA-Zelenograd facility -- which hosts the development of microelectronics, IT, robotics and medical equipment -- was also targeted. The facility \"is one of the centers where import substitution of critical components previously imported from the West takes place,\" Kovalenko said.",
      "ABC News could not immediately verify Kovalenko's claim of successful strikes on the facilities.",
      "Russia continued its own long-range attacks on Ukraine overnight. Ukraine's air force said Moscow launched six missiles and 88 strike drones into the country, of which 71 drones were shot down or otherwise neutralized. The air force said it recorded impacts in eight locations.",
      "The intensity of strikes by both sides have only increased since Trump's return to office in January, the president having promised to end Russia's war on its neighbor war in 24 hours. Trump has not delivered on that promise, and his frustration appears to have been building in recent weeks with the continued failure of U.S.-led ceasefire efforts.",
      "Trump called Putin \"absolutely crazy\" in a Sunday social media post, then on Tuesday said Putin \"doesn\u2019t realize is that if it weren\u2019t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He\u2019s playing with fire!\"",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine are now waiting for Russia to deliver its peace memorandum -- a document promised by Putin to Trump during a phone call between the two leaders earlier this month. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Tuesday that Moscow was still working on the document.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cast doubt on the Russian proposal. \"They've already spent over a week on this,\" he wrote on social media on Tuesday. \"They talk a lot about diplomacy. But when, in the midst of all that, there are constant Russian strikes, constant killings, relentless assaults, and even preparations for new offensives.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Andriy Yermak -- the head of Zelenskyy's presidential office -- wrote on Telegram, \"Russians are masters of empty words.\"",

      "The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets.",
      "The alleged attempted robbery is known as a \u201cwrench attack.\u201d It\u2019s a name popularized by an online comic that mocked how easily high-tech security can be undone by hitting someone with a wrench until they give up passwords.",
      "Wrench attacks are on the rise thanks in part to cryptocurrency\u2019s move into mainstream finance, Phil Ariss of the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs said in a recent blog post.",
      "\u201cCriminal groups already comfortable with using violence to achieve their goals were always likely to migrate to crypto,\u201d Ariss said.",
      "Some of the crypto\u2019s key characteristics help explain why wealthy individuals who hold a lot of digital assets can be ripe targets for such attacks.",
      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.",
      "Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one\u2019s private keys, which are like passwords used to access one\u2019s crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don\u2019t need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "In the case in New York, where two people have been charged, a lot of details have yet to come out, including the value of the bitcoin the victim possessed.",
      "Stealing cryptocurrency is almost as old as cryptocurrency itself, but it\u2019s usually done by hacking. North Korean state hackers alone are believed to have stolen billions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto in recent years.",
      "In response to the threat of hacking, holders of a large amount of crypto often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \u201ccold wallets.\u201d Used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But they can\u2019t defeat thieves who force a victim to give up their password to access their wallets and move money.",
      "The case in New York is the latest in a string of high-profile wrench attacks. Several have taken place in France, where thieves cut off a crypto executive\u2019s finger.",
      "Experts suggest several ways to mitigate the threats of wrench attacks, including using wallets that require multiple approvals before any transactions.",
      "Perhaps the most common way crypto-wealthy individuals try to prevent wrench attacks is by trying to stay anonymous. Using nicknames and cartoon avatars in social media accounts is common in the crypto community, even among top executives at popular companies.",

      "The emergency petition involves migrants headed to South Sudan.",
      "The Trump administration on Tuesday filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to lift what it called \"onerous\" due process procedures imposed by a federal judge for immigrants slated for deportation to a third country other than their own.",
      "Solicitor General John Sauer told the court in the filing that a nationwide mandate issued last week by Judge Brian Murphy of the District Court of Massachusetts has created a \"diplomatic and logistical morass\" that is imposing \"significant and irreparable harm\" on the government's efforts to remove criminal aliens.",
      "After a group of detainees said to be headed to South Sudan sued over their alleged inability to raise fears of torture, Judge Murphy issued a preliminary injunction halting any future removals unless detainees were given notice of their destination, at least 10 days to raise concerns for their safety, and 15 days to contest an adverse finding by an immigration officer.",
      "The temporary order applies universally to any individual slated for removal to a third country. The government is required under international law to ensure that migrants in its custody are afforded protections under the Convention Against Torture, of which the U.S. is a signatory. The Trump administration insists it has been in compliance.",
      "\"Based on what I've learned,\" Judge Murphy said during a hearing last week, \"I don't see how anybody could say that these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object. If I was in any of those groups and I was going to be deported to South Sudan, I would need an opportunity to investigate that and to be able to articulate a well-founded fear about why being returned to South Sudan would be would result in torture or death. The department did not do it. In this case, they did not offer any opportunity to object.\"",
      "Sauer told the justices Murphy's move exceeds his authority, \"jeopardizes the public interest,\" and has upended sensitive diplomatic and national security negotiations with third countries. He said all of the detainees to be removed have already received adequate due process and had final orders for removal entered.",
      "\"The district court's invented process offers little but delay. While certain aliens may benefit from stalling their removal, the Nation does not,\" he wrote.",
      "As part of its aggressive push to remove unlawful or criminal immigrants, the Trump administration has pursued third-country partners willing to accept those who will not be taken back by their home countries.",
      "Hundreds of migrants in recent months have been sent by the U.S. to the CECOT prison in El Salvador even though they are not Salvadoran nationals. The administration has also sought removals to several African nations.",
      "The Supreme Court -- increasingly thrust to the center of escalating disputes over aspects of Trump's immigration policy -- has unanimously ruled that all non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded \"due process of law\"",
      "\"Detainees are entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard appropriate to the nature of the case,\" the justices unanimously stated last month in a per curiam (unsigned) opinion.",
      "The specifics, however, remain contested. Legal scholars say the type of \"notice\" and \"hearing\" historically afforded depends on an immigrant's status and circumstance, such as whether they had been lawfully admitted to the country in the first place, have deep ties to the community, or are seeking asylum.",
      "The court is also currently weighing the ability of individual federal judges to issue binding nationwide orders, blocking the government from executing a policy. After Trump issued an executive order ending birthright citizenship \u2014 and three district court judges issued injunctions against it -- the administration asked the high court to issue definitive guidance the matter. A decision is imminent.",

The panel has been expected to vote on the matter in their June meeting. In mid-April, the panel had discussed, and seemed to support, a recommendation that everyone over 6 months should receive an annual COVID vaccine or shift to a model where only those who were high-risk would be eligible.",
      "Typically, the CDC director green-lights new vaccine recommendations, but with the active director role empty while Susan Monarez awaits confirmation for the CDC's top job, Kennedy announced the new recommendations. Kennedy recently made changes to vaccine recommendations for those traveling abroad to an area with elevated risk of infections with the agency noting, \"With pending confirmation of a new CDC Director, these recommendations were adopted by the HHS Secretary on May 13, 2025 and are now official recommendations of the CDC.\"",
      "A leader of a medical group that is typically involved in the process for changes to the immunization schedule noted he was \"kind of blindsided by this announcement.\"",
      "\"We were not consulted about this,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases, told ABC News, referring to the removal of the COVID-19 vaccine from the recommended immunization schedule for children.",
      "\"My biggest concern is about the process. This really ignores a long-established, evidence-based process that has been used to make vaccine recommendations in the U.S. It ignores the opinions of the medical experts who help make these recommendations, and it also ignores all of the liaison organizations that work with the [CDC's advisory panel] to craft these recommendations,\" O'Leary said.",
      "The Infectious Diseases Society of America said the decision will have a negative impact.",
      "\"Many health insurers rely on federal recommendations to determine coverage, and this decision could make it significantly harder for millions of Americans to access vaccines they want for themselves and their families,\" the society said in a statement Tuesday.",

      "The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his attack on the school as the university has not complied with the administration's demands over providing data on its international students.

      "The letter also alleges that the university has \"potential discriminatory hiring practices and possible violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" The letter also takes issue with what they say is Harvard's \"disturbing lack of concern for the safety and wellbeing of Jewish students,\" according to the administration official -- a reference to instances of antisemitism on campus.",
      "The letter says that agencies should \"consider its contracts with Harvard University and determine whether Harvard and its services efficiently promote the priorities of the Agency.\" It also instructs agencies to have a list of contracts with the university and the action the agency will take on it by June 6.",
      "\"We recommend that your agency terminate for convenience each contract that it determines has failed to meet its standards, and transition to a new vendor those contracts that could be better serviced by an alternative counterparty.

      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.",
      "Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one\u2019s private keys, which are like passwords used to access one\u2019s crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled Tuesday that 14 states can proceed with their claims against Musk and DOGE. The states, through their attorneys general, sued in February over the defendants' alleged constitutional violations.",
      "The states had asked Chutkan to temporarily block DOGE from accessing any data systems or terminating any federal employees. But the judge denied that request on Feb. 18. She found that there were legitimate questions about Musk\u2019s authority but said there weren't grounds to justify a temporary restraining order.",
      "Chutkan agreed Tuesday to dismiss President Donald Trump as a defendant in the lawsuit, but she refused to dismiss the claims against Musk and DOGE.",
      "The plaintiffs' attorneys argued that Musk\u2019s actions, including those carried out at his direction by DOGE personnel, are unconstitutional because he hasn't been legally appointed.",
      "Chutkan wrote: \u201cThe Constitution does not permit the Executive to commandeer the entire appointments power by unilaterally creating a federal agency pursuant to Executive Order and insulating its principal officer from the Constitution as an \u2018advisor\u2019 in name only. This is precisely what Plaintiffs claim the Executive has done.\"",
      "The Trump administration has maintained that layoffs are coming from agency heads and insisted that Musk hasn't been running DOGE\u2019s day-to-day operations.",
      "Chutkan, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case against Trump in Washington.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk is criticizing the centerpiece of President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, a significant fracture in a partnership that was forged during last year's campaign and was poised to reshape American politics and the federal government.",
      "The billionaire entrepreneur, who supported Trump\u2019s candidacy with at least $250 million and has worked for his administration as a senior adviser, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by what the president calls his \u201cbig beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "The legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a \u201cmassive spending bill\u201d that increases the federal deficit and \u201cundermines the work\u201d of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\u201cI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201d",
      "His CBS interview came out Tuesday night. White House officials did not immediately respond to questions. Republicans recently pushed the legislation through the House and are debating it in the Senate.",
      "Musk\u2019s comments come as he steps back from his government work, rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He's also said he'll reduce his political spending, because \"I think I\u2019ve done enough.\u201d",
      "At times, he's seemed chastened by his experience working in government. Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target.",
      "\u201cThe federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cI thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.\u201d",
      "Musk had previously been effusive about the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis.",
      "He was also effusive in his praise of Trump.",
      "\u201cThe more I\u2019ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,\" Musk said at one point. \"Frankly, I love him.\u201d",
      "Trump repaid the favor, describing Musk as \"a truly great American.\u201d When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.",
      "It's unclear what, if any, impact that Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate. During the transition period, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.",
      "But Trump remains the dominant figure within the Republican Party, and many lawmakers have been unwilling to cross the president when he applies pressure for his agenda.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.",
      "House Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit neutral or reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3 trillion to the debt, including interest, over the next decade.",

      "NEW YORK -- Perhaps the outlook developed when COVID-19\u2019s uncontrolled spread upended nearly every facet of their young lives. Maybe it was hardened as the worst of climate change\u2019s harms grew likelier despite scientists\u2019 stark warnings. It's possible the attitude even formed from early memories of the financial insecurity brought upon their families by the Great Recession.",

      "The gap extends to other behaviors. An AP-NORC poll conducted in March found that only about one-quarter of adults under 30 volunteered their time to charity in the past year or provided non-financial support to people in their community, compared to 36% of those over 60. Younger adults were also more likely than older adults to say they or their household donated $0 to charity, according to the poll.",
      "The philanthropic sector is working to reverse any disillusionment by empowering Gen Z to make the structural change they so often seek. Born out of the idea that young people distrust institutions because they don\u2019t feel served or included, several initiatives are underway with hopes that more responsive institutions will be seen as more legitimate ones.

      "Harvard University will relinquish 175-year-old photographs believed to be the earliest taken of enslaved people",
      "BOSTON -- Harvard University will relinquish 175-year-old photographs believed to be the earliest taken of enslaved people to a South Carolina museum devoted to African American history as part of a settlement with one of the subjects' descendants.",
      "The photos of the subjects identified by Tamara Lanier as her great-great-great-grandfather Renty, whom she calls \u201cPapa Renty,\" and his daughter Delia will be transferred from the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to the International African American Museum in South Carolina, the state where they were enslaved in 1850 when the photos were taken, a lawyer for Lanier said Wednesday.",
      "The settlement marks the end of a 15-year battle between Lanier and the nation\u2019s most elite university to release the 19th-century \u201cdaguerreotypes,\" a precursor to modern-day photographs. Lanier\u2019s attorney Joshua Koskoff told The Associated Press that the resolution is an \u201cunprecedented\u201d victory for descendants of those enslaved in the U.S. and praised his client's yearslong determination in pursuing justice for her ancestors.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of one in American history, because of the combination of unlikely features: to have a case that dates back 175 years, to win control over images dating back that long of enslaved people \u2014 that\u2019s never happened before,\" Koskoff said in a phone interview.",
      "The AP sent an email seeking comment from Harvard.",
      "Lanier, who lives in Connecticut, sued the Ivy League institution in 2019 for \u201cwrongful seizure, possession and expropriation\u201d of the images of Renty, Delia and five other enslaved individuals. The suit attacked Harvard for its \u201cexploitation\u201d of Renty\u2019s image at a 2017 conference and in other uses. It said Harvard has capitalized on the photos by demanding a \u201chefty\u201d licensing fee to reproduce the images.",
      "The daguerreotypes were commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz, whose theories on racial difference were used to support slavery in the U.S. The lawsuit says Agassiz came across Renty and Delia while touring plantations in search of racially \u201cpure\u201d slaves born in Africa.",
      "To create the images, both Renty and Delia were posed shirtless and photographed from several angles.",
      "\u201cTo Agassiz, Renty and Delia were nothing more than research specimens,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThe violence of compelling them to participate in a degrading exercise designed to prove their own subhuman status would not have occurred to him, let alone mattered.\u201d",
      "In 2022, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in Lanier\u2019s favor and reaffirmed the merits of Lanier's lawsuit against Harvard after a lower court judge ruled she had no legal claim to the images.",
      "The state\u2019s highest court recognized \u201cHarvard\u2019s complicity in the horrific actions surrounding the creation of the daguerreotypes,\u201d saying that \u201cHarvard\u2019s present obligations cannot be divorced from its past abuses.\u201d",
      "In a statement Wednesday, CEO of the International African American Museum Dr. Tonya M. Matthews called Harvard's relinquishing of the images a moment \"175 years in the making.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bravery, tenacity, and grace shown by Ms. Lanier throughout the long and arduous process of returning these critical pieces of Renty and Delia\u2019s story to South Carolina is a model for us all,\u201d she said.",
      "The South Carolina museum has committed to working with Lanier and including her in decisions about how the story of the images will be told.",
      "\u201cIt's not an improvement just to move them from one closet in a mighty institution to another. And so really, the real importance of this is to allow these images to breathe, to allow the story \u2014 the full story \u2014 to be told not by a conflicted player in the story, which Harvard was from the beginning,\u201d Koskoff said.",
      "The attorney said \u201ceverybody has the right to tell the story of their own families.\u201d",
      "\"That\u2019s the least, most basic right we might have,\" he said. \u201cTo be able to tell the story of her family with a museum that will allow her to tell it \u2014 I mean, you can\u2019t do any better than that.\"",
      "In Lanier's lawsuit, she asked for Harvard to acknowledge its complicity in slavery, listen to Lanier\u2019s oral family history and pay an unspecified sum in damages. An undisclosed financial settlement was part of the resolution with Harvard announced Wednesday, but Koskoff said Harvard still hasn't publicly acknowledged Lanier's connection to them or its connection to perpetuating slavery in the U.S., Koskoff said.",
      "\u201cThat is just left unanswered by Harvard,\u201d he said.",
      "He said Lanier isn't expecting or waiting to hear from the institution, but that the settlement speaks for itself.",
      "\u201cIn the end, the truth will find you \u2014 you can you can only hide from it for so long,\" he said. \"Yes, history is written by the winners. But over time, you know, those winners look like losers sometimes.\u201d",

      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs stood with local Republican leaders at the start of this year's session, optimistic that Republicans in the Legislature would embrace her proposal to create rural groundwater management areas. But almost four months later, talks have stalled and frustration has mounted as both sides try to find a solution to conserve water that's increasingly becoming more scarce amid a prolonged drought.",
      "Negotiators have not met since early April, Hobbs\u2019 office said. Around the same time, Republicans and some interest groups grew frustrated with a separate proposal by the Arizona Department of Water Resources to slash overdraft in the Willcox Basin by a percentage that is \u201cunattainable,\u201d said Sen. Tim Dunn, one of the Republican negotiators.",

Republicans who introduced their own plan say the one from Democrats is too high. Democrats say the GOP proposal isn't high enough.",
      "Both sides also disagree on the makeup of local councils that would govern groundwater usage, the water basins that would be included and the pathway for future regulation.",
      "Meanwhile, underground water supplies continue to shrink to the point that some wells in rural areas have gone dry. Residents are faced with the choice of drilling deeper, hauling water or moving, said Sarah Porter, director of the Arizona State University Kyl Center for Water Policy. Managing the groundwater won't reverse the decline but can slow it, she said.",
      "Arizona\u2019s regulatory framework for managing groundwater was first enacted in 1980 and largely centers on the state\u2019s most populous areas, including Phoenix and Tucson. Porter said the active management areas were designed to apply to growing cities and are too burdensome to replicate in rural areas where agriculture is at the heart of local economies.",
      "The Arizona Department of Water Resources has proposed a separate reduction in overdraft in the Willcox Basin, which caused uneasiness among Republicans and others who say that could jeopardize businesses in rural Arizona.",
      "For years, legislators on both sides of the aisle have failed to get proposals to manage groundwater in rural Arizona to the governor\u2019s desk or signed into law.",
      "In 2022, voters approved a ballot measure to establish an active management area in Douglas, a rural city on Arizona\u2019s southeastern edge. In recent months, Hobbs used executive authority to create another in the Willcox Basin, another rural community north of Douglas.",
      "Bipartisan negotiators have not met in several weeks on a framework that would significantly broaden the scope of the Groundwater Management Act, according to multiple people.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that the rural groundwater negotiations are going nowhere,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Priya Sundareshan, one of the legislative negotiators.",
      "In a Tuesday statement, Hobbs accused GOP legislators of refusing to come to the negotiating table.",
      "Dunn said since the last negotiating meeting he's been meeting regularly with people on what language they might find agreeable despite sour moods over the water resources proposal for the Willcox Basin and the little time lawmakers have left to make a deal. He said he would like to call another meeting with Hobbs' office and Democratic legislators soon but said the water resource\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t bode well for talks in the Legislature.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s their end game, we can\u2019t get there,\u201d Dunn said.",
      "Philip Bashaw, CEO of the Arizona Farm Bureau, which has been involved in crafting the GOP rural groundwater bills the past two years, said the water resources' proposal further frustrated negotiations on the bills and fueled anxiety.",
      "\u201cIt definitely took a lot of the air out of the balloon, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Bashaw said.",

      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green has signed legislation boosting a tax imposed on hotel room and vacation rental stays in order to raise money to address eroding shorelines, wildfires and other consequences of climate change",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii's governor signed legislation Tuesday that boosts a tax imposed on hotel room and vacation rental stays in order to raise money to address eroding shorelines, wildfires and other consequences of climate change.",
      "The signing, which comes nearly two years after a Maui wildfire killed 102 people and wiped out almost all of Lahaina town, marks the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet.",
      "Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually. The money will be used for projects like replenishing sand on eroding Waikiki beaches, promoting the use of hurricane clips to secure roofs during powerful storms and clearing flammable invasive grasses like those that fueled Lahaina\u2019s wildfire.",
      "Gov. Josh Green, speaking at a bill signing ceremony, said Hawaii needs to build more firebreaks and pay a fire marshal, a new position created after Lahaina that Green expects to be staffed within the next two months.",
      "Green said other states and nations will need to act similarly to address climate disasters roiling the planet.",
      "\u201cThere will be no way to deal with these crises without some forward-thinking mechanism,\u201d Green said.",
      "The measure adds an additional 0.75% to the daily room rate tax starting Jan. 1. Green said this amounts to an extra $3 tax on a $400 hotel room rate.",
      "It also levies a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills starting July 2026, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports, to bring cruise ship taxes in line with room taxes on land.",
      "Travelers to Hawaii already pay a significant room tax. With the new law, the state\u2019s existing 10.25% tax on short-term accommodations will climb to 11%. Together with other state and county taxes, visitors will pay a nearly 19% levy on their accommodations \u2014 one of the highest rates in the country.",
      "Hawaii's hotels ultimately supported the bill, saying it would help improve the visitor experience. Green said the industry looked at \u201cthe greater good\u201d for tourism, Hawaii and the planet.",
      "Green initially proposed a bill that would put revenue from the tax increase into a dedicated fund, but lawmakers instead put the money into the state's general fund. Their compromise measure calls on the governor to request funds from the Legislature for projects in the following areas: protecting native forests, plants and animals; enhancing climate resilience; and mitigating the effects of tourism on the environment. Green said they will collaborate to implement the law.",
      "State Rep. Adrian Tam, the chairperson of the House tourism committee, said the state must earn the public's trust that it will spend the money transparently and in the best way possible. He noted Hawaii's tourism economy relies on a brand that's in part dependent on a pristine natural environment.",
      "\u201cThe visitor industry will struggle if we do not take action now,\" said Tam, a Democrat representing Waikiki. \"There will be nothing left for them to showcase to the rest of the world if our beaches are decimated, wildfires have taken over our towns and hikes left unmanaged.\u201d",

The Toyota 4Runner the men were inside and another vehicle were damaged in the March 2023 shooting, but the men were not hurt.",
      "Kemp was initially charged with one count of first-degree assault with a firearm enhancement, but prosecutors last week added another count of assault as well as a drive-by shooting charge, The Seattle Times reported. Convictions on those charges could have resulted in a lengthy prison term.",
      "He will be sentenced in August. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Thomas Howe recommended that Kemp be sentenced to nine months in jail, one year of Department of Corrections supervision and support after he is released, and to pay restitution.",

      "According to court documents filed by Kemp's attorneys, Kemp and several employees who worked at his cannabis dispensary were at a Seattle concert venue when Kemp\u2019s truck was broken into on March 8, 2023. An employee's purse was stolen along with keys to Kemp's business, a cellphone, paperwork and sports memorabilia, including game-worn Gary Payton and Kemp jerseys that were to be auctioned off for charity, the defense's trial brief says.",

It did not work.\u201d The 4Runner fled and when the vehicle was found abandoned days later, an empty holster was found inside but there was no gun, documents said.",
      "A police call log included in court records indicates that at least one witness who called 911 reported that two men were firing at each other.",
      "Howe, in a statement explaining the plea agreement, wrote that because of the two witnesses\u2019 past crimes of dishonesty and the \u201cfact that those people were illegally in possession\u201d of Kemp\u2019s belongings, the case should be resolved short of trial.",
      "As part of his plea, Kemp cannot have a firearm and will be required to provide a sample for a law enforcement DNA database.",

      "The orphaned cub was about two months old when he was found April 12 in Southern California's Los Padres National Forest \u2014 weak, underweight and alone. Since then, the baby bear has been cared for by Welch's team with the San Diego Humane Society in sessions that mimic familial behaviors. The hope is to eventually return the cub to the wild.",
      "The bear costume is meant to stop the rescued cub from bonding with humans. The fur coats are stored in bins with hay scented by black bears. The team went through a few masks before finding one that fit properly.",
      "\u201cMama\u201d is a giant stuffed teddy bear propped up in the corner of a pen at the humane society's 13-acre (5-hectare) Ramona Wildlife Center near San Diego. That's where the cub turns when he's spooked or just wants to snuggle up for a nap, said Welch, the wildlife operations manager.",
      "\u201cHe's probably really missing his real mom,\u201d she said.",
      "When the costumed caregivers enter, the cub treats them like siblings. He rambunctiously plays with them and happily accepts grass and fresh wildflowers to munch.",
      "A milestone was met recently when the youngster learned to dig through soil for worms and insects, \u201cwhich he caught on to pretty quick,\u201d Welch said. Other food is placed in tree branches for him to find on his own. Team members took heart when they recently found the cub snoozing on a tree branch, a common behavior for bears in the wild.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very thoughtful. He\u2019s constantly taking in his environment,\u201d Welch said.",
      "The California Department of Fish and Wildlife tried to reunite the cub with his mother after campers found him. They returned the youngster to the wild overnight, but took him in when she didn't appear. The emaciated 3-pound (1.3-kg) baby bear was then transported to the Ramona wildlife center.",
      "The cub has quadrupled in size since then.",
      "Biologists hope they can return him to the wilderness next year, provided he can learn to find food, seek shelter and avoid people.",
      "The cub is the fourth to enter rehab care in California in the past five years. He could be paired with a buddy if another one turns up, because that would reduce the risk of them imprinting on humans.",
      "In Virginia, employees of the Richmond Wildlife Center last year acted like mother foxes to feed and care for an orphaned kit. Video shows a caregiver in a red fox mask and rubber gloves feeding the tiny animal from a syringe. Like the California cub and his teddy bear, the kit sat on a large stuffed animal fox that was supposed to look like her mother.",
      "The costumed-care technique is relatively new, Welch said, so there's no conclusive research on its effectiveness. But in Ramona, humane society employees wearing coyote masks successfully raised three orphaned pups who have since been released into the wild.",
      "And the humane society is amassing animal masks just in case.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t found a good skunk mask yet,\u201d Welch said.",

      "\u201cUnder this pilot entry process, any biological female student-athlete who would have earned the next qualifying mark for one of their Section\u2019s automatic qualifying entries in the CIF State meet, and did not achieve the CIF State at-large mark in the finals at their Section meet, was extended an opportunity to participate in the 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships,\u201d the federation said in a statement. \u201cThe CIF believes this pilot entry process achieves the participation opportunities we seek to afford our student-athletes.\u201d",
      "The move comes amid a nationwide battle over the rights of transgender youth in which states have limited transgender girls from participating on girls sports teams, barred gender-affirming surgeries for minors and required parents to be notified if a child changes their pronouns at school. At least 24 states have laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some of the policies have been blocked in court.",
      "A recent AP-NORC poll found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women\u2019s sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats.",
      "The federation didn't specify whether the change applies to all events or only events where a trans athlete has qualified for the final. The change only applies to this weekend's competition. The organization didn't say how many students will be affected by the change.",
      "The rule change may be the first attempt nationally by a high school sports governing body to expand competition when trans athletes are participating.",
      "Trump threatened Tuesday to pull federal funding in California if the state did not bar trans students from participating in girls sports. The post referenced AB Hernandez, a trans athlete who is scheduled to compete in the girls varsity triple jump, high jump and long jump in the state finals. She won the Division 3 girls long jump and girls triple jump and placed seventh in the high jump at the Southern Section Division Finals on May 19, according to CIF results.",
      "\u201cTHIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Trump also criticized Maine\u2019s Democratic governor after she said the state would take the president to court over his effort to keep trans girls from competing in girls sports.",
      "The Trump administration launched an investigation earlier this year over a California law that says districts can\u2019t force teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently said on his podcast that it's \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d for transgender girls to participate in girls sports. Charlie Kirk, the conservative commentator and podcast guest, referenced Hernandez when asking Newsom about the issue.",
      "Trump said he planned to talk to Newsom about it Tuesday. The governor\u2019s office did not confirm the call but said the California Interscholastic Federation rule change was a \u201cthoughtful approach.\u201d",
      "\u201cCIF\u2019s proposed pilot is a reasonable, respectful way to navigate a complex issue without compromising competitive fairness \u2014 a model worth pursuing,\u201d Newsom's spokesperson Izzy Gardon said.",
      "Sophia Lorey with the conservative California Family Council, which has protested Hernandez competing in girls sports, said the rule change was \u201cdamage control.\u201d",
      "\u201cGirls who were unfairly eliminated are suddenly back in for State this weekend,\" Lorey said. \"This is a step in the right direction, but let\u2019s be real: this never should\u2019ve happened. Boys don\u2019t belong in girls sports.\u201d",
      "Democratic state lawmakers blocked bills last month that would have barred transgender girls from participating in girls sports.",
      "Equality California, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, said the Trump administration was \u201cbullying a child\" and called on CIF to uphold its \u201cinclusive, evidence-based policies.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur community is watching, and we are counting on the CIF to uphold its policies, adhere to California law, protect its athletes, and reaffirm that everyone deserves to compete safely and authentically,\u201d the group said in a joint statement with several other organizations.",
      "Parents and conservative advocates opposed to transgender girls competing in girls sports have criticized Hernandez\u2019s participation and heckled her during postseason meets.",
      "After losing to Hernandez in long jump at the sectional final, student Katie McGuinness urged the CIF to change its policy during an interview on Fox News.",
      "\u201cI have nothing against this athlete as a person and I have nothing against the trans community,\u201d McGuinness said. \u201cMy message today is really specifically to CIF and for them to act quickly and in a timely manner, because this is a really time-sensitive issue.\u201d",
      "Hernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month in response to verbal attacks from adults that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do about people\u2019s actions,\" so she is focused on what she can control.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still a child, you\u2019re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\u201d she said.",
      "In an email, Hernandez\u2019s mother declined to comment on Tuesday's rule change.",

      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has suspended a Dane County judge who left court to try to arrest a hospitalized defendant and got into an argument with another defendant",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended a Dane County judge for a week Tuesday for leaving court to try to arrest a hospitalized defendant herself and getting into a sarcastic exchange with another defendant seeking a trial delay.",
      "The court agreed with a judicial conduct review panel's suspension recommendation for Ellen Berz, finding that she deserved more than a reprimand because she behaved impulsively and showed a lack of restraint. The suspension will begin June 26, the court ordered.",
      "\u201cWe believe that the recommended seven-day suspension is of sufficient length to impress upon Judge Berz the necessity of patience, impartiality, and restraint in her work, and to demonstrate to the public the judiciary's dedication to promoting professionalism among its members,\" the justices wrote in the suspension order. Justice Jill Karofsky, herself a former Dane County judge, did not participate in the case.",
      "The suspension order noted that Berz has acknowledged the facts of the case and has accepted full responsibility. Andrew Rima, one of two attorneys for Berz listed in online court records, declined to comment. Her other attorney, Steven Caya, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email.",
      "Berz is the second Wisconsin judge that the state Supreme Court has suspended in the last five weeks. The justices suspended Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan indefinitely on April 29 after federal prosecutors accused her of helping a man evade U.S. immigration agents by showing him out a back door in her courtroom.",
      "A federal grand jury has indicted Dugan on one count of obstruction and one count of concealing a person to prevent arrest. She has pleaded not guilty and is set to stand trial in July.",
      "The Wisconsin Judicial Commission filed a misconduct complaint against Berz, the Dane County judge, in October accusing her of failing to promote public confidence in judicial impartiality, failing to treat people unprofessionally, and failing to performing her duties without bias.",
      "According to the complaint, Berz was presiding over an operating-while-intoxicated case in December 2021. The defendant didn't show up in court on the day the trial was set to begin. His attorney told Berz that the defendant had been admitted to a hospital.",
      "Berz had a staff member investigate and learned that he was in a Sun Prairie emergency room. The judge ordered her bailiff to go arrest him, but was told the bailiff couldn't leave the courthouse. She declared that she would retrieve the defendant herself, and if something happened to her, people would hear about it on the news, according to the complaint. She then left court and began driving to the emergency room with the defendant\u2019s attorney in the passenger seat, the complaint says. No prosecutor was present in the vehicle.",
      "She eventually turned around after the defense attorney warned her that traveling to the hospital was a bad idea because she was supposed to be the neutral decision-maker in the case, according to the complaint. She went back into court and issued a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest.",
      "The complaint also alleges she told a defendant in a child sexual assault case who had asked to delay his trial for a second time that he was playing games and should \u201cgo to the prison and talk to them about all the games you can play.\u201d",
      "When the defendant said her sarcasm was clear, she told him: \u201cGood. I thought it would be. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it to you that way, because I thought you would relate with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe is calling lawmakers into a special session to consider aid for tornado victims and incentives for stadiums for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Missouri lawmakers are to kick off a special session Monday to consider aid for tornado victims and a package of financial incentives aimed at keeping the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals from leaving the state for new or improved facilities in neighboring Kansas.",
      "Gov. Mike Kehoe announced the special session Tuesday, less than two weeks after a deadly tornado hit St. Louis and the Legislature wrapped up its work without giving final approval to a late-developing plan that would authorize state bonds for the Chiefs and Royals valued at up to half the cost of the stadium projects.",
      "Missouri officials are scrambling to come up with an offer because Kansas lawmakers last year authorized bonds for up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales, and new sales and alcohol taxes.",
      "\u201cIf Missouri does not put some sort of offer forward,\u201d Kehoe said, \u201cI think the risk is real that they don\u2019t stay here.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs and Royals have played professional football and baseball for five decades in side-by-side stadiums in eastern Kansas City in Jackson County, Missouri, drawing fans from both sides of the split metropolitan area. Their stadium leases run until 2031, and Royals owner John Sherman has said the team won\u2019t play at Kauffman Stadium beyond the 2030 season.",
      "Jackson County voters turned down a sales tax extension last year that would have helped finance a $2 billion ballpark district for the Royals in downtown Kansas City and an $800 million renovation of the Chiefs\u2019 Arrowhead Stadium. That prompted Kansas officials to put together an offer and forced Missouri officials to recalculate their plans.",
      "The Chiefs and Royals are part of a new round of stadium construction that is underway for professional sports teams across the U.S., with taxpayers often helping to pay the multibillion-dollar tabs. Many economists contend public funding for stadiums isn\u2019t worth it, because sports tend to divert discretionary spending away from other forms of entertainment rather than generate new income.",
      "But Kehoe said the teams drive \u201cbillions of dollars in economic activity and tourism.\u201d Supporters of the projects also point to the sense of community and national attention that sports teams can bring, noting the three recent Super Bowls won by the Chiefs and the Royals' World Series title a decade ago.",
      "The proposal would allow Missouri to make 30 years of bond payments equal to the annual state tax revenue generated by the teams in the year before their application for state aid. It also authorizes up to $50 million of tax credits for the stadium projects. Local governments also would have to provide some aid for the teams. The location and total cost of the projects are not specified in the proposal.",
      "The prospects for a special session are uncertain because of tensions in the Missouri Senate. In the final days of the regular session, majority Republicans used rare procedural moves to shut down Democratic opposition and force passage of two measures. One repeals a paid sick leave law approved last November by votes. The other authorizes a referendum on repealing a voter-approved abortion-rights amendment. Democrats vowed to retaliate by slowing down the Senate for a year to come.",
      "The day after the Legislature wrapped up its work, tornadoes struck St. Louis and other parts of Missouri, capping a series of severe storms that also caused damage in March and April. Kehoe is proposing a $5,000 income tax deduction to help offset the cost of insurance policy deductibles for affected people and $25 million to expand eligibility for a state emergency housing assistance program for people living in areas covered by state requests for presidential disaster declarations.",
      "Kehoe's special session agenda also includes spending on constructions projects around the state, including $25 million to help fund a research nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri. That's half the amount that was included in a budget bill that failed to pass the House amid concerns about state spending and conflicts with the Senate. Other proposed projects include a 200-bed mental health facility in Kansas City and new livestock barns at the Missouri State Fairgrounds.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-mauceri-pericardial-constriction-nyu-langone-heart-health/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 08:10:59 -0400",
    "summary": "John Mauceri had a complicated health history, but his sudden swelling and fatigue left his team of doctors stumped.",
    "story": [
      "Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence.",
      "In December 2023, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a \"troublesome\" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his left lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later.",
      "Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct.",
      "\"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes,\" Mauceri said. \"Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house.\"",
      "No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms.",
      "\"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain,\" Mauceri said.",
      "Searching for a diagnosis",
      "Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure.",
      "While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But \"the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest,\" the doctor said.",
      "What is pericardial constriction?",
      "Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen.",
      "It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19.",
      "Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.",
      "Mauceri accepted that the surgery was his only option.",
      "\"There was no alternative,\" he said. \"I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'\"",
      "A high-risk surgery",
      "Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's \"heart was trapped\" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said.",
      "\"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped,\" Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said.",
      "Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one.",
      "\"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell,\" Grossi said.",
      "Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.",
      "\"Every day is a miracle\"",
      "After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college.",
      "\"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it,\" Mauceri said.",
      "His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again.",
      "Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success.",
      "Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in October, shortly after his 80th birthday.",
      "\"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore,\" he said. \"I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did.\"",

      "The City of Gary was built by the steel industry, but when families like Fitzpatrick's moved to the region in droves from the South during the Great Migration for jobs and opportunities, they didn't know as much as we do now about the health risks linked to industrial production.",
      "\"A lot of the teachers would talk about students that had asthma,\" Fitzpatrick said.",

      "CBS News Chicago Investigators dug into state and federal data from the Environmental Protection Agency to see how these facilities impact the community.",
      "Our investigation found that in 2023, the latest data available, the three mills emitted 25 million pounds of toxins, more industrial pollution than the combined toxic release of the four similar mills in other states.",
      "\"We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,\" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.",
      "Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.",
      "\"The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,\" she said.",
      "The study found people living near one steel production facility have a 12% to 26% higher risk of getting cancer. People in Gary live near three.",
      "And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.",
      "Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.",
      "\"I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,\" Melton said.",
      "The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.",
      "\"What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,\" Mayor Melton said.",
      "Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.",
      "So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?",
      "\"They're responsible for protecting clean air,\" Lewis said. \"And right now, they're not doing that.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.",
      "\"If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,\" Melton said.",
      "Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.",
      "Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.",
      "More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.",
      "U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts \"legally emitted,\" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.",
      "In regards to the Industrial Labs report, U.S. Steel said it was \"designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick has lived in Gary for 60 of her 71 years, never fully knowing what she was exposed to.",
      "\"I didn't think I was living a lifestyle that was polluting my body,\" she said.",
      "She wasn't. Dr. Stenson said Fitzpatrick doesn't have the typical risk factors for her cancer. And she's not alone.",

      "Gary has been notorious for its pollution for decades.",
      "Dr. Mihir Bhayani, also at Rush University Medical Center, is getting closer to directly linking air pollution and some cancers. The new research he is working on could force change.",
      "\"What we are working on currently is, again, a direct causal link between air pollution and head and neck cancer,\" he said.",
      "He believes steel mills are making people sick in Gary, and he wants to see emissions standards toughened.",
      "\"So that individuals who are living in those areas, they're exposed to the same clean air that individuals who are living in more affluent areas are,\" he said.",
      "\"The types of communities that this industry is impacting are disproportionately people of color and low-income communities,\" said Lewis.",
      "More than 76% of Gary's population is Black, and the average income is less than $23,000 a year.",
      "About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.",
      "Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.",
      "\"I am worthy. No matter what you think about my Black skin, my dark skin, I'm worthy. I'm worthy for this community to be cleaned up and I am a person worthy of a good life,\" she said.",
      "Gary and other communities found to be disproportionately impacted by pollution were getting extra help from the federal EPA's Environmental Justice office, but in April it was labeled a DEI program and shut down.",
      "If nothing is done, Bhayani said, there will be long-term effects on people living in communities like Gary.",
      "\"They are going to have higher rates of cancer. They're going to have higher rates of cardiac disease. They're going to have high rates of lung disease,\" Bhayani said.",
      "That's why Fitzgerald, who fought for her voice while still battling the disease that nearly took it, said she'll do whatever it takes to make change here so that it can be different for someone else.",
      "\"As long as I have breath and I can breathe and I have strength to get up, I'm going to join other people, like-minded people. We're going to fight. We're going to fight,\" she said.",

      "FULL STATEMENTS",
      "On whether they have studied the impact of releases from Gary Works and the health effects, including cancer and asthma, in the community:",
      "\"In 2020, the EPA deemed that there was an ample margin of safety around iron and steel emissions to protect public health and prevent adverse environmental effects.\"",
      "It is important to note that there are many industrial facilities in Northwest Indiana. Focusing solely on Gary Works as a source of pollution is both incorrect and irresponsible.",
      "On the study released by Industrial Labs:",
      "\"It is clear that these conclusions were pre-determined by a group that describes itself as 'scaling campaigns and building a movement to clean up heavy industry', which is to say that this document is designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions. There are certain interests campaigning to eliminate U.S.-based blast furnaces, which are essential to national security and the health of America's economy because they are the only facilities capable of making certain types and qualities of steels required for critical applications.\"",
      "On residents believing toxic releases would not be allowed at the same level in more affluent communities with different demographics:",
      "\"Federal and state emissions laws and regulations apply equally to any municipality in the same jurisdiction. Gary, Indiana, is no exception. We care deeply about the communities where we live and work, as evidenced by the contributions by the Company and our employees. Since 2020, U. S. Steel Gary Works and its employees have donated over $1.3 million dollars to community organizations and efforts. In addition, our dedicated employees volunteer countless hours of their time to organizations and schools across the area. Our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees put safety and environmental compliance first. We are proud of their work and the Northwest Indiana community we call home.\"",
      "\"In addition to our spend on environmental compliance and community investment and engagement, we were the only U.S. Metals, Minerals and Mining company recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for 2025- the fourth consecutive year we received this designation. It is a testament to our commitment to ethical conduct and compliance.\"",
      "\"Gary Works was built in 1908, and the city was built around it. Any notion that we select certain areas to operate because of their demographics is wholly incorrect.\"",
      "On state and federal EPA fines, violations and consent decrees:",
      "\"U. S. Steel spends more than $80 million annually on environmental controls in Indiana as part of its commitment to environmental excellence. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, from which this data is drawn, includes manufacturing byproducts that are legally emitted under the EPA's stringent regulations and those which are legally disposed of in permitted landfills. As the nation's largest integrated steelmaking facility, it is common sense that U. S. Steel's Gary Works will have more legally allowed releases than smaller iron or steel mills in the country.\"",
      "Additional comment on emissions controls and other projects:",
      "\"U. S. Steel has robust systems and emissions control equipment at all levels of the steelmaking process to adhere to environmental regulations.",
      "At Gary Works, our processes and environmental controls are monitored extensively by our teams. Third parties are also used for sampling water and for opacity observation to ensure compliance with regulations.",
      "Our partnership with CarbonFree is one of the ways we're working to reduce emissions. This carbon capture and utilization project will help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions by converting emissions to calcium carbonate, which is used in a variety of products for consumers and industry.\u00a0 Gary Works also produces Pig Iron, an important feedstock for U. S. Steel's electric arc furnaces. The Company is on track to meet its goal of 20% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 goal and has a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\"",
      "IDEM is not a health agency nor a legislative body. IDEM is also not involved in local zoning decisions that determine where businesses are located.",
      "IDEM is responsible for implementing and enforcing existing federal and state environmental regulations. This includes issuing operating permits that ensure businesses comply with applicable environmental standards and conducting routine inspections to monitor compliance. When facilities are found to be out of compliance, IDEM can initiate enforcement actions or refer cases for further legal or administrative review.",
      "The U.S. EPA does require states to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) for areas in nonattainment within its borders. You can find more information on the SIPs for Lake and Porter counties here: https://www.in.gov/idem/sips/",
      "In 2013, IDEM conducted an assessment of air toxics in the industrialized area of Lake and Porter County. The complete Lakeshore Air Toxics Study is available here: https://www.in.gov/idem/toxic/studies/lakeshore-air-toxics-study. The study found air toxics concentrations and risk within the lakeshore area to be similar to comparable communities, and the most significant risk is attributable to mobile sources (motor vehicles). In the time since the study, technological advances and pollution prevention strategies have led to a further decline in industrial emissions.",
      "We recognize that air quality is a deeply important issue for Northwest Indiana residents and remain committed to our responsibilities under the Clean Air Act and other applicable laws. For more specific responses to questions involving federal enforcement actions, health data, or proposed changes to emission standards, we encourage you to follow up directly with the U.S. EPA.",
      "EPA is fulfilling its mission to protect human health and the environment. The agency works with our state partners to ensure industrial facilities comply with all environmental laws and regulations.",
      "EPA performs on-site and off-site inspections to ensure compliance. If noncompliance is found, EPA takes action. EPA has issued three recent Clean Air Act enforcement settlements, which have significantly reduced air emissions. In Burns Harbor, Cleveland Cliffs BOF steel making shop and Phoenix Global slag processing companies and in Gary, the U.S. Steel Gary Works' blast furnace have all decreased particulate matter and metal hazardous air pollutants to the atmosphere. Our state partner, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, also conducts inspections and enforcement actions.",
      "Previous compliance and enforcement work, including inspections and enforcement activity, can be found in EPA's ECHO system. You can search by location or by facility. Keep in mind that the integrated iron and steel mills that you reference may have contractors on site that have separate permits and emissions reporting.",
      "The northern portions of Lake and Porter Counties are part of a larger Chicago area that was found to be out of compliance with the ground-level ozone (or \"smog\") standard.\u00a0 Ozone high in the atmosphere protects people from harmful ultraviolet rays but at ground-level it can trigger a variety of health problems, such as lung irritation.",

      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",

      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",

      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",

It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",

    "summary": "It doesn't take $1 million to secure a sense of financial well-being, according to new research from Vanguard.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for an $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

      "Recent college graduates are having a harder time finding work, despite their higher education degrees, which usually give job-seekers a leg up in the labor market.",
      "That's according to a new report from Oxford Economics which shows that unemployed recent college grads account for 12% of an 85% rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. That's a high number, given that this cohort only makes up 5% of the total labor force.",
      "What's more, the rate of unemployment among workers who have recently graduated from college and are between the ages of 22 and 27, is nearing 6% \u2014which is above the national unemployment rate of 4.2%.",
      "\"People who have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher have a higher unemployment rate than national average, and this is the first time this has happened in the last 45 years of data,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That's noteworthy, he said, because \"those with higher educational attainment usually have better prospects overall than their peer with less.\"",
      "So why are recent college grads are having a tougher time finding work post-college than previous graduating classes did?",
      "While the report points to a couple of factors, it finds that a slowdown in hiring in formerly hot sectors is driving the growth in unemployment among degree holders.",
      "\"The rise in the recent graduate unemployment rate is largely part of a mismatch between an oversupply of recent graduates in fields where business demand has waned,\" according to the report.",
      "That holds especially true in the tech industry, as more college students graduate with degrees in computer science and related fields than any other major.",
      "\"Prospects for employment will remain minimal for these individuals, keeping the unemployment rate elevated in the near term,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in the report.",
      "Tech sector-centric",
      "Computer science is among the fastest-growing fields of study among undergrads, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, but jobs in the sector are particularly vulnerable to replacement by automation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence also expose workers in the field to being rendered obsolete.",
      "\"There's a mismatch between business demand and the labor supply overall,\" Martin said. \"And it's very concentrated in the technology sector.\"",
      "The industry hired at a fast clip when the economy reopened post-pandemic, before pulling back. Those cuts are likely still affecting the current unemployment rate, according to Martin.",
      "\"Some of it could be a normalization after the tech sector's hiring surge at the end of the pandemic around 2021,\" he said. \"But there's also evidence that AI is starting to impact lower-level computer science gigs,\" he added.",
      "Experienced workers who graduated with computer science degrees but have racked up more than a few years of experience are faring fine, noted Martin. It's those who do the kind of lower-level, rote work that AI is already adept at, who are seeing a mismatch between the number of jobs available and the supply of workers seeking them.",
      "\"Some of it might be businesses being productive with the workers they have and not wanting to increase costs overall by hiring. It could also be higher adoption rates of AI,\" Martin said. \"At the moment, it looks to be a bit of both.\"",
      "Uncertainty slows hiring",
      "Economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's aggressive, yet ever-changing tariff agenda, is also leading a number of businesses to press pause on growth and investment. Because of this, the unemployment rate among recent college graduates could continue to inch upward, according to Martin.",
      "\"We are heading into a period where uncertainty is really high; the impact of tariffs is starting to bleed through, and businesses are facing higher input costs,\" he said.",
      "Although recent college graduates who have secured employment aren't being laid off at higher rates than the rest of the workforce, Martin doesn't expect things to get easier for young graduates on the hunt for employment, absent a surge in hiring by tech companies or mass exodus of workers from the labor force.",
      "\"There is some softening in demand overall, but a lot of it is concentrated at the moment in recent college graduates, and we are looking for the unemployment rate to rise,\" he said.",
      "The \"underemployment\" effect",
      "When qualified workers with college degrees try and fail to find work in their desired field, they tend to continue seeking work, sometimes looking for a job in another sector, as opposed to withdrawing from the labor force, the report notes. That can lead to college-educated workers finding themselves \"underemployed,\" or in roles where 50% of the workers who occupy them do not have a bachelor's degree or higher.",
      "This scenario can doom them for years to come: Underemployed workers tend to remain so for the rest of their careers, according to a report.",

      "President Trump\u00a0said again Tuesday he's working to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president announced last week he was considering the move, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed Tuesday he is \"working on\" taking Fannie and Freddie public, but will continue overseeing the two enterprises even if their conservatorship ends. He also said the \"U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES\" to Fannie and Freddie, referring to the decades-old belief that the government would rescue Fannie and Freddie if needed, which likely keeps their borrowing costs low by making them appear safe to investors. It's unclear what form the \"guarantee\" could take in the future.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "story": [
      "Trump Media and Technology Group on Tuesday said it's struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion that will be tapped to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency.",
      "The company's move into cryptocurrency comes after Trump Media has ventured into other investment arenas, including starting exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and separately managed accounts with investment strategies the company says are \"rooted in American values and priorities.\"",
      "In its Tuesday announcement, Trump Media said it has an agreement with about 50 institutional investors to buy $1.5 billion of the company's stock, along with another $1 billion in debt that can be converted into stock at a later date. The $2.5 billion in funds will be used to create a \"bitcoin treasury,\" which the company said will be added to its balance sheet.",
      "This would be in addition to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that Trump Media already holds, which it said were worth $759 million.",
      "President Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies, both through his private business and his administration. He has directed his officials to create a national \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin, ethereum and lesser-known cryptocurrencies. The goal for Trump Media \u2014 best known for its Truth Social app \u2014 is to push the company into becoming more than a tech business, according to CEO Devin Nunes.",
      "\"It's a big step forward in the company's plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles,\" Nunes said in the Tuesday statement.",
      "Shares of Trump Media tumbled $2.14, or 8.3% to $23.58 in early afternoon trading. Because the deal is based on issuing $1.5 billion worth of new shares of the company, as well $1 billion in convertible debt, the offer could dilute the value of existing shareholders' stock, including Mr. Trump's.",
      "What's happening with Truth Social?",
      "Trump Media's push into money management and cryptocurrencies comes as Truth Social continues to lose money.",
      "In the first quarter, Truth Social lost $31.2 million, while its revenue rose 7% to $821.2 million. In a May 9 regulatory filing, Trump Media said its Truth Social has \"generated limited advertising revenue\" to date, while it expects to \"incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future\" as it builds its streaming business.",
      "Social media businesses typically rely on advertising as a core source of revenue, with companies targeting their ads to specific demographics, such as app users who are, say, young parents or retirees.",
      "Truth Social doesn't release data about the size of its user base, but rival social media apps have typically recorded much higher sales growth, such as Reddit, which said its fourth-quarter ad sales jumped 60% to $394.5 million from a year earlier.",
      "Why is Trump Media venturing into financial services?",
      "Trump Media describes its new division, called Truth.Fi, as mixing financial services and financial technology.",
      "\"By expanding into this realm, we aim to serve millions of investors in America and around the world who believe in the greatness of the American economy and want to invest in superior companies while avoiding the giant, woke investment funds and politically motivated debanking problems,\" the company's May 9 regulatory filing said.",
      "\"Debanking\" is the term used by some conservative figures who have accused banks of barring them from opening accounts or blocking access to their assets because of their political views, prompting a Senate hearing in February over the issue. It's\u00a0also been the focus of some crypto investors, such as Nathan McCauley, who testified in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "Trump Media's crypto investment \"will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and U.S. firms, and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+,\" Nunes said in the statement.",

      "Analysts noted that the stop-and-go nature of the president's tariff policies have been a key driver of market volatility in recent weeks, with stock movements hinging upon news of potential trade deals. All the while, experts say that the president's moves could be part of his overall strategy to broker new deals.",
      "\"With the Europe tariff threat removed, at least for now, markets got more evidence that tariffs are largely a negotiation tool,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, released Tuesday morning, found consumer confidence rose 12.3 points to reach 98.0, up from 85.7 in April. The upswing follows month of decline in the index, triggered by fears of inflation and tariff-induced economic uncertainty. Analysts, however, warned the positive turnaround may be short-lived.",
      "\"Consumer confidence in May rebounded after trade tensions eased, but this may only be temporary,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in a research note.",
      "The bond market remained steady after easing slightly on Friday, after concerns earlier in the week over the nation's debt led to an uptick in Treasury Yields. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury were at 4.5% as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Still, this moment of calm may also be temporary, some economists say. In a research note on Tuesday, UBS analysts said investors should brace for more volatility in the bond market, as Mr. Trump's budget bill still\u00a0awaits approval from the Senate.",

      "At the same time, sales of battery-electric vehicles by all manufacturers rose about 28%, the group's data shows.",
      "The numbers are the latest indication of how much the Tesla brand is suffering because of the backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk over his far-right views. Crowds have gathered at Tesla dealerships in both Europe and the U.S., with protesters objecting to Musk's work with President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed the U.S. federal workforce and been the subject of multiple lawsuits.",
      "The protesters are aiming at Tesla to dent Musk's fortunes, given that much of his wealth is tied up in shares of the electric vehicle maker.",
      "\"2025 started off as a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla as Elon's role in the Trump Administration and DOGE created a life of its own which created brand damage and a black cloud over the story,\" noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a May 23 research note.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-rate-funtionally-unemployed-economy/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 08:36:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Many workers aren't working as much as they'd like. Here's what one expert says the federal unemployment rate fails to capture.",
    "story": [
      "While the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, another measure of worker well-being indicates there may be bigger cracks in the labor market.",
      "The low unemployment rate, which stood at 4.2% in April, has signaled to economists and investors alike that the U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Employers are also continuing to hire despite headwinds like tariffs and plunging consumer confidence.",
      "But another indicator suggests those pieces of government data may be painting an overly rosy picture of the economy, with a recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finding the \"true rate\" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, up slightly from 24% in March, while the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate remained unchanged at 4.2% over the same period.",
      "LISEP's measure encompasses not only unemployed workers, but also people who are looking for work but can't find full-time employment, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. By tracking functionally unemployed workers, the measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion.",
      "\"The unemployment data, as it's put out, has some flaws,\" LISEP chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"For example, it counts you as employed if you've worked as little as one hour over the prior two weeks. So you can be homeless and in a tent community and have worked one hour and be counted, irrespective of how poorly-paid that hour may be.\"",
      "LISEP, in a working paper on the gauge, says the measure prevents part-time jobs or poorly paid work from being counted as equal to full-time and better-paid work. LISEP also argues that the unemployment rate \"presents a very incomplete and, in many ways, misleading picture.\"",
      "In other words, people who lack steady work and don't earn living wages shouldn't be counted as functionally employed. Its True Rate of Unemployment (TRU), which began tracking the measure in 2020, encapsulates workers whose earnings don't allow them to make ends meet, and are struggling just to get by, according to LISEP.",
      "\"If you're part time and can't get a full-time job, then we count you as functionally unemployed,\" Ludwig noted. \"We also count as functionally unemployed people who don't earn above a poverty wage.\"",
      "\"Survival mode\"",
      "In so doing, it counts workers who can't afford to put roofs over their heads, can't procure nutritious meals and don't have the ability to save as being functionally unemployed.",
      "\"You don't have anything that gets you to the first rung of the American dream ladder. You're in survival mode,\" Ludwig said.",
      "When broken down by race and gender, TRU shows Hispanic, Black and women workers faring worse than White workers, as well as men.",
      "More than 28% of Hispanic workers, and nearly 27% of Black workers are functionally unemployed, compared to 23% of White workers. And more female workers \u2014 28.6% \u2014 are functionally unemployed than male workers, whose true rate of unemployment stands at 20%, according to LISEP.",
      "Millions of households are currently struggling to maintain a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to another recent analysis from LISEP.",
      "Its research found that the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living. These households earned an average of $38,000 per year in 2023, but would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "The wide chasm between the the BLS's measure of unemployment and its true rate of unemployment is also concerning, according to Ludwig.",
      "\"If you say there's 4.2% unemployment, which makes political folks happy because it's a low number, it causes all kinds of poor policy decisions and assumes we are better off than we are,\" Ludwig said. \"There's less energy and less of a push to improve employment, and the people who get hurt are middle- and low-income Americans.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 26 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The World Travel & Tourism Council projects international visitors will spend $169 billion in 2025, a nearly 7% decrease from last year.",
    "story": [
      "Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan is a small city with a thriving economy. That's because visitors from its larger northern sister city in Ontario, Canada, keep the border town's economy humming.",
      "Situated on opposite sides of the St. Marys River, the U.S. and Canadian counterparts are connected by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, over which thousands of vehicles pass each month.",
      "\"It's so intertwined,\" said Linda Hoath, executive director of the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau, who noted that many people have family members on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. \"There's no separation between the two communities,\" she said.",
      "But with the U.S. trade war unleashed against Canada\u00a0in recent months\u00a0\u2014 along with reports of detentions of travelers at the Canadian border by U.S. immigration authorities and threats of annexation by\u00a0President Trump, the chasm between the two neighbors has grown, as fewer Canadians make the trip south to the United States.",
      "According to Sault Ste. Marie's International Bridge Administration, the passenger car traffic in April was down 44% compared with last year. And while the waning bridge traffic may not mean much from the view of Canada's second-largest province and most popular\u00a0destination, to the historic Michigan town it certainly does.",
      "\"They have 70,000 people,\" Hoath said. \"And if they're not coming over and buying in our stores, then it affects us much more.\"",
      "Slowdown in travel to the U.S.",
      "Sault Ste. Marie is not alone in its tourism concerns. Though travel this Memorial Day weekend is expected to be the highest on record, one group has been noticeably absent at U.S. travel checkpoints in recent months: international travelers.",
      "International travel to the U.S.\u00a0fell 14% in March\u00a0compared with the same period last year, according to the the U.S. Travel Association. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest dip in travel, 20.2%, was from Canada, according to research from Tourism Economics, a unit of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Trudeau urged Canadians to\u00a0refrain from vacationing in the U.S., after Mr. Trump slapped a 25% tariff\u00a0on Canadian goods. The drop-off in Canadian travel is a notable shift, given that Canada was the biggest source of inbound travel to the U.S. last year, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "As to what's behind the overall slowdown in international travel to the U.S., experts point to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, the strength of the U.S. dollar and long visa wait times. Aggressive tariff policies have also left a bad taste in many travelers' mouths.",
      "\"Shifting sentiment and perceptions of the U.S. are expected to continue to weigh heavily on travel demand,\" said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics.",
      "As of April, flight bookings to the U.S. for the May\u2013July travel window are 10.8% lower than they were the same period last year, according to the research firm. It projects an 8.7% decline in international arrivals in 2025.",
      "Economic Impact",
      "The slowdown in international travel threatens to destabilize America's tourism industry which plays a vital role in supporting the nation's economy.",
      "\"International inbound travel is hugely important from an economic standpoint \u2014 people that come to the U.S. and visit spend on average $4,000 per visit,\" a spokesperson from the U.S. Travel Association, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those dollars may already be slipping away: The World Travel & Tourism Council projects that spending by international visitors to the U.S. will drop to $169 billion, or 7%, this year, from $181 billion in 2024. That's a 22.5% decrease from peak tourist spending of $217 billion in 2019, before the pandemic.",
      "Fewer international travelers could also take a toll on the workforce that props up America's tourism industry: Nearly 10% of American jobs are tied to the travel industry, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "An ongoing decline in international travel to the U.S. could result in a loss of over 230,000 jobs \u2014 with the dining and lodging industries expected to be the most hard hit, according to a recent analysis from the economic research firm IMPLAN.",
      "\"It's not going to devastate the U.S. economy in terms of GDP, but it is very significant in terms of employment,\" Jenny Thorvaldson, IMPLAN's chief economist and data officer, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hoath, who runs the visitor center in Sault Ste. Marie, said she is already worried about what those losses could mean for her community.",
      "\"When we're looking at the bridge and it's packed, people have to get their employees together,\" she said. \"But if it's not so busy, what happens to your employees? They're not making the money. Some people will be laid off.\"",
      "Hotel bookings in the city of 14,000 are already down 77% year to date, according to the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau.",
      "Shifting focus to domestic travelers",
      "As international tourism dampens, local communities like Flagstaff, Arizona, are rerouting their attention to domestic travelers.",
      "Despite the city's wide international appeal, the travel season has gotten off to a slow start. Flagstaff has seen a 15% to 20% drop in international tourists year over year, according to Trace Ward, director of Flagstaff's Convention and Visitors Bureau.",
      "While he hopes that decline will only be temporary, Ward is looking for ways to bring in more American tourists. One strategy he has in mind is adding more direct flights to the area and possibly attracting a new airline. The city is also promoting its\u00a0Lowell Observatory's new Astronomy Discovery Center, which offers visitors a glimpse of the cosmos.",
      "\"I look forward to the excitement of the international traveler coming back full steam, but until then, we're gonna sell to whoever is interested in coming here,\" Ward said.",
      "Hoath, likewise, has shifted her focus toward attracting visitors from within the States, and has decided to halt spending on any advertising in Canada.",
      "\"When you don't have a ton of funds, you've got to put them where you know they have a better possibility of working,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/delta-air-lines-100th-year-takes-flight/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 May 2025 09:53:33 -0400",
    "summary": "What began as the world's first aerial crop-dusting operation in the Mississippi Delta in 1925 has survived mergers, recessions and bankruptcy to become a global carrier with 5,000 flights a day.",
    "story": [
      "When you picture a garage sale, you might think of your neighbor's driveway down the street, not an aviation workshop in the shadow of the world's busiest airport, where Delta Air Lines holds their monthly surplus sale.",
      "Delta fans came from as far as Michigan and even Korea to buy the stuff the airline no longer needs, from seats to engine parts. It's a chance, these folks say, to own a piece of airline history. And how would they get the stuff home? \"We actually flew down with empty bags,\" said one man.",
      "Sarah Zeis came in search of a particular piece of Delta history: a well-used beverage cart. \"I actually need a bar cart in my apartment of these exact dimensions,\" she said.",
      "Getting it home will be a journey all its own.",
      "Proceeds from the sale go right across the parking lot, to the Delta Flight Museum, now celebrating the airline's 100th year \u2013 a first for an American carrier.",
      "It's a century of service that started without beverage carts \u2026 or passengers!",
      "According to archives director Marie Force, Delta owes its existence to a tiny pest: the boll weevil. \"It is the most unique beginning of a U.S. airline, I think,\" she said. \"It's the only airline that started as a crop-dusting company\"",
      "Before Delta, there was Huff-Daland Dusters, started in 1925 in Macon, Georgia. Force said, \"After the first growing season, they realized that most of the center of the business was in the Mississippi Delta region. And so, that's where the name Delta comes from.\"",
      "And in 1929, Delta Air Lines' founder C.E. Woolman expanded the company from pest control to people. Its first passenger flight was from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with two stops in Louisiana along the way. A ticket cost $90 round trip \u2013 about $1,700 today. Expensive, and not for everyone. Force said, \"At that time, about 80% of Delta's passengers were businessmen\" \u2013 people trying to speed up a trip that took 12 hours by train to a five-hour flight.",
      "Nearly a century after that first flight, Delta now has more than 5,000 flights a day. The airline has survived mergers, recessions, and bankruptcy, growing from that single route to a nationwide carrier, and the global force we know today.",
      "\"Glamour personified\"",
      "If you've flown Delta lately, you've seen flight attendant Susan Slater in the pre-flight safety video. If you've flown Delta in the last 60 years, you may have shared a cabin with either Slater (who started with the airline on March 2, 1964) or Kay Carpenter (who started in January 1966). It was the \"Golden Age\" of air travel, that romanticized era of flights with exceptional service, extravagant meals, and everyone dressed to the nines.",
      "Back then, said Slater, \"You had to be unmarried. Your hair couldn't touch your collar. You had a weight restriction. Back then I think I weighed 103 pounds and I was 5 foot 2-and-a-half. I'm five feet now, barely, and not 103!\"",
      "I asked, \"What was it about the job that you think spoke to you so much?\"",
      "\"All I knew was that this was glamour personified,\" Slater replied.",
      "Atmosphere Research Group's Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, says there is no need to be so quite so nostalgic: \"We certainly had a so-called Golden Age of flying back in the early 1960s,\" he said. \"But it was less convenient. There were fewer flights. You often had to connect. And it certainly wasn't as reliable and safe as it is today.",
      "\"We're in the new type of Golden Age now, where flying is a lot more accessible,\" he said. \"You can either buy or create a much nice journey for yourself. You can buy an extra leg room seat. You can pay for priority boarding. And by the way, if you don't need or value those things or perhaps can't afford it, you're not being charged for services that you don't want.\"",
      "Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, said, \"Air travel is one of the great bargains. If you think about the average fare today versus where it was 30, 40 years ago, it's less than half of what you pay in real dollars.\"",
      "While low fares are sought after by some fliers, Delta has built its business around a premium experience, according to Bastian: \"The single biggest reason why people chose an airline was fare; whoever had the lowest cost won. And Delta, well, yes, we have a product to compete on the lower end. [But] the majority of our revenue comes from higher-end tickets.\"",
      "Their 100th summer is about to take flight, amid clouds of uncertainty \u2026 worries about a slowing economy and aviation safety. But Bastian says it could still be their busiest ever, as he looks to the future.",
      "So, what does he see for Delta's next hundred years? \"When you think in the United States, you know, air travel is relatively ubiquitous \u2013 you jump on a plane almost any hour of the day and get to almost anywhere you want, you know, pretty, pretty easily,\" Bastian said. \"However, when you think about the world, and you realize that only one in five people in the world has even been on an airplane, it's pretty remarkable. We need to figure out ways to make it accessible, to make it affordable, to make it sustainable.\"",
      "I said, \"Part of that legacy is just how much the world has shrunk in those 100 years.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's what we do,\" Bastian said. \"We make the world a more connected place, a smaller place. And that's needed now more than ever.\"",
      "While Delta helped shrink the world in the 20th century, they hope their own growth continues, thanks to folks like Susan Slater and Kay Carpenter.",
      "\"It's been a wonderful adventure,\" Carpenter said. \"I never dreamed that I would be here for this long. When I started, we had just small airplanes. We flew to small cities. And now we fly to six continents. So, I tell all these new hire flight attendants to always remember that one mile on a highway is going to take you exactly one mile. But a mile on a runway will take you anywhere.\"",

      "The pouches were produced by Bowman Andros, a French company with a manufacturing plant in Mount Jackson, Virginia, according to the company's website. Publix issued the voluntary recall on May 9, but it wasn't added to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall list until late Thursday.",
      "The potential contamination was flagged by officials in North Carolina, the state that first identified a 2023 lead poisoning outbreak linked to tainted applesauce pouches that sickened more than 500 U.S. children.",
      "Routine sampling of the baby food pouches found lead levels at 13.4 parts per billion, according to North Carolina agriculture officials. That exceeds the FDA's recommended limit of 10 parts per billion for such products intended for babies and young children.",
      "Publix said all the potentially contaminated products have been removed from store shelves. No illnesses have been reported, the company said. Customers can return the pouches to local stores for full refund.",
      "This is the second baby food pouch recall because of potential lead contamination in two months. In March, Target recalled more than 25,000 packages of its store brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree because of elevated lead levels.",
      "North Carolina collaborates with the FDA to conduct routine testing of food products, officials said.",
      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. Those findings led to the detection of a nationwide outbreak linked to the pouches, which were widely sold in Dollar Tree and other stores. Tests showed they contained lead at levels 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum recommended level, as well as chromium.",
      "Federal health officials eventually identified 566 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected cases of lead poisoning tied to the pouches in 44 states.",

      "Nippon Steel said in a statement that it \"applauds President Trump for his bold action to approve our partnership with U. S. Steel,\" but did not provide additional details about the terms of the deal.",
      "\"We share the Trump administration's commitment to protecting American workers, the American steel industry, and America's national security,\" Nippon Steel said, calling the agreement \"a game changer \u2014 for U.S. Steel and all of its stakeholders, including the American steel industry.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has levied 25% tariffs on all foreign steel imports in an effort to keep industry players in the U.S.",
      "Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel",
      "Nippon Steel's bid to buy the U.S. company had always included plans to keep its headquarters. To\u00a0sweeten the deal, Nippon Steel had offered up a $2.7 billion commitment to upgrade facilities in Pennsylvania and Indiana on top of an earlier commitment to spend $1.4 billion.",
      "U.S. Steel's CEO David Burritt warned last September that if the deal were blocked, U.S. Steel would \"largely pivot away\" and it would raise \"serious questions\" about remaining headquartered in Pittsburgh.",
      "U. S. Steel's board and stockholders approved Nippon Steel's bid last year. It has been opposed by the United Steelworkers union. The union had no immediate comment Friday.",
      "During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he opposed the deal, and before taking office\u00a0he reiterated he was \"totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company.\"",
      "Then-President Biden also opposed the deal, and after months of review he made a decision in early January to block it. The two companies filed lawsuits in response.",
      "Then in February, Mr. Trump suggested that\u00a0Nippon Steel\u00a0wouldn't buy U.S. Steel, as it had planned, but that it would instead invest in U.S. Steel.",
      "Nippon Steel's president said turning U.S. Steel into a wholly-owned subsidiary was\u00a0the starting point of negotiations, according to recent reporting from\u00a0Nikkei Asia, which said the companies also discussed various other proposals.",
      "\"U.S. Steel is a very special company. We don't want it to go to Japan or any other place, so we're working with them. I don't know if they need any money now, I'll be honest with you. They've hit gold,\"\u00a0Mr. Trump said\u00a0at the White House last month.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 16:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data. Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The massive budget bill passed by the House includes new tax breaks for tipped workers and those who get overtime.",
    "story": [
      "The massive Republican-backed budget bill \u2014 called \"one big, beautiful bill\" by President Trump \u2014 includes several new tax rules that could have a big financial impact on millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay.",
      "While the heart of the bill is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, the legislation also includes several provisions that were part of the president's campaign last year, such as his vow to eliminate taxes on tipped income.",
      "The bill could deliver savings of about $1,700 for each tipped worker as well as employees who earn overtime, the House Ways and Means Committee said on May 20. But there are some restrictions in the bill that could limit the financial boon for these workers, with some policy experts saying that the tax breaks may not be as useful as they first appear.",
      "For instance, almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax, according to the Brookings Institution. Consequently, the tax break is likely to provide a bigger helping hand to higher-paid tipped workers, while leaving some low-income workers behind.",
      "\"If your goal is to help the poorest service workers, this is probably not the way to do it,\" said Michael Lynn, a professor of services marketing at Cornell University whose research largely focuses on tipping and other consumer behavior.",
      "The 1,100-page bill, which squeaked through the House on Thursday by a single vote, will now go to the Senate, where more changes are likely. Here's what to know about the provisions as they now stand.",
      "How would the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision work?",
      "Called the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision within the House bill, the rule would create a new tax deduction that eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people who work in jobs that have traditionally received them.",
      "There are about 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, or about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The tax break includes some restrictions:",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.\u00a0Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.\u00a0The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",

      "The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "\"The tip exemption will significantly increase take-home pay for most tipped workers, many of whom are low- to middle-income taxpayers,\" the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), a group that advises the president on economic issues, said in a report published earlier this month.",
      "The CEA's report estimates that the average take-home pay for tipped workers would increase by $1,675 per year under the provision.",
      "Would it help all tipped workers?",
      "No, because 4 in 10 tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income taxes, which means they wouldn't see any benefit. There's also a concern that some employers could reclassify some workers as tipped workers by arguing they would receive a tax break, according to Brookings.",
      "The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, versus $7.25 an hour for non-tipped workers.",
      "One Fair Wage, an advocacy group representing service workers, criticized the measure, noting that the GOP bill also includes cuts to social safety net programs that many tipped workers rely on. \"It also slashes Medicaid, putting 1.2 million restaurant workers at risk of losing health care,\" One Fair Wage posted on social media.",
      "What about the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act?",
      "A separate, standalone bill called the No Tax on Tips Act, which is solely focused on giving a tax break to tipped workers, was passed by the Senate on May 20, with bipartisan support. That bill will now move to the House for a vote.",
      "The Senate bill offers similar benefits and restrictions as the \"one big, beautiful bill\" when it comes to taxes and tips, but with one major difference: The bigger GOP bill requires workers, as well as their spouses, to have a Social Security number.",
      "That requirement appears to be aimed at excluding some immigrants from tapping the tax break, while the Senate bill doesn't stipulate that taxpayers who claim this break, or their spouses, must have a Social Security number.",
      "Senator Jackie Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, urged lawmakers to pass the Not Tax on Tips Act arguing in a statement that the bigger GOP bill combines the tax break with cuts to vital programs like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\"We shouldn't be forcing working families to choose between keeping their health care or keeping their tips, which is why we want this bipartisan bill on its own \u2014 on its own \u2014 not part of a harmful, extreme budget bill,\" Rosen said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.",
      "How does the \"No Tax on Overtime\" provision work?",
      "The GOP bill includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime, another one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises.",
      "About 8% of hourly workers and 4% of salaried workers receive overtime pay on a regular basis, according to the Yale Budget Lab. About 70% of salaried workers don't qualify for overtime pay, it noted.",
      "The legislation would enable workers to claim a deduction on their taxes for the amount they earned in overtime pay during the tax year, although there are some restrictions:",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",

      "But more guidelines about the provision would still need to be determined by the Treasury Department, according to tax firm Wolters Kluwer in a May 22 publication about the tax bill.",

      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",

      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",

    "story": [
      "In a TikTok video, then-17-year-old actor Symonne Harrison unveils a bathroom counter full of products from the skincare brand Drunk Elephant that would retail for at least $700 total.",
      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

      "The Justice Department said the couple, who starred on \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" submitted false financial statements to obtain more than $30 million in personal loans to pay for their luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel. They used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones and then filed for bankruptcy.",
      "While later earning millions from their reality TV show, the couple concealed their income from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes, while also failing to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "Julie Chrisley was also convicted of obstruction of justice.",
      "In the release announcing their prison sentence in 2022, a Justice Department attorney said \"their lengthy sentences reflect the magnitude of their criminal scheme and should serve as a warning to others tempted to exploit our nation's community banking system for unlawful personal gain.\"",
      "In his call Tuesday with the couple's children, Mr. Trump said the couple received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\"",
      "The couple's daughter, Savannah, has been seeking a pardon for her parents. In an interview with Mr. Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump on Fox News earlier this month, she said her parents had been unfairly targeted because of their celebrity status, adding that prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, had referred to them as \"the Trumps of the South.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who took charge of the department in the difficult months after the U.S. Capitol siege, is retiring from his position Friday. After the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, he helped rebuild the department's shrunken staff, beefed up recruitment efforts and bolstered the agency's intelligence operations and communications to fix weaknesses revealed by the breach of the Capitol.",
      "Manger told CBS News he faced stiff challenges when he arrived on the job in 2021.",
      "\"The department as a whole had lost confidence in the (prior) leadership as a result of what happened,\" he said. \"And there were big things that were identified as things that needed to be fixed as quickly as we could fix them: Things like the intelligence failures, the communication failures, the equipment failures, the training failures, the leadership failures \u2014 all of those things needed to be addressed immediately.\"",
      "Manger, a former local police chief in Fairfax County, Virginia, and Montgomery County, Maryland, successfully advocated for increases in funding to improve hiring, equipment and operations.",
      "The department was blasted by critics for intelligence failures that contributed to the violation of the complex on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"We now have a world class intelligence operation. We are significant players in the intelligence community in the Washington, D.C., region and, frankly, all over the country,\" Manger said. \"Whereas before, we were basically just\u2014 ... we were consumers of information. The FBI would give us intelligence, other agencies would give us intelligence. Now we are gathering our own.\"",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police Board will select a new police chief, which Manger predicts will happen soon.",
      "Manger has requested nearly $1 billion in funding for 2026, which would represent the latest in a series of recent budget boosts for the department. In testimony before a congressional committee on justifying his budget request, Manger cited an elevated number of investigations into threats against members of Congress.",
      "\"The current climate of threats has reached alarming levels,\" he told the committee in April. Capitol Police records show the number of threats launched against congressional members in 2024 exceeded 9,400.",
      "He added, \"Social media and the internet provide a breeding ground for threats that \u2014 regardless of their nature \u2014 the department must investigate.\"",
      "Manger and the Capitol Police have also bolstered the department's operations outside of Washington, responding to potential threats in the hometowns of lawmakers.",
      "The department has a unique mission among police agencies, protecting elected leaders and securing the U.S. Capitol campus, which hosts over 3 million visitors each year. The Capitol is open to the public, and lawmakers are accessible to citizens.",
      "Manger has been critical of the pardons issued by President Trump to free Capitol rioters who beat, clubbed and gassed Capitol Police and other officers during the attack on the Capitol. He told CBS News that when Mr. Trump issued 1,500 pardons to the suspected and convicted rioters when he took office, it \"was probably one of my worst days in this job.\"",
      "He also blasted conspiracy theories about Jan. 6 that continue to circulate on social media.",
      "\"My folks were here on Jan. 6. They were part of what went on. They were assaulted,\" Manger said. \"They were in fights. Many of them were injured. They know exactly what happened on Jan. 6. For somebody to make up some story that, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad,' \u2014 it is just not true.\"",
      "\"What a chilling message to law enforcement, because we've got a job to do, and we don't care what the issue is,\" Manger continued. \"We don't care what side of the coin you're on on any particular issue because we have a job to do, to maintain public order and to keep the peace.\"",
      "Rep. Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, said of Manger, \"Since taking over at the department's hour of greatest need, he professionalized a force in need of steady leadership.\"",
      "A union representative for Capitol Police officers told CBS News, \"Manpower is still an issue, as well as balancing work and family life for the rank and file officers, which continues to plague morale within the agency.\"",
      "As he prepares to leave the department, Manger was lauded by one of the former Capitol Police officers who responded to the Jan. 6 riot. Former officer Harry Dunn told CBS News, \"He showed his love for country, his love for law enforcement and his continued dedication to public service.\"",

    "story": [
      "The State Department has ordered U.S. embassies to temporarily stop scheduling new student visa appointments, as the Trump administration works to expand social media screenings for applicants, the latest in a series of restrictions on international students.",
      "In a cable dated Tuesday and obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts not to add any more appointments for student and foreign exchange visas in preparation for the expanded vetting, and to take any unfilled appointments off their calendars. If students have already scheduled their visa interviews, those can still go forward.",
      "The pause will last \"until further guidance is issued\" in the next few days.",
      "The State Department is preparing for an \"expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" and all student visa applicants could be subject to social media checks, according to the cable. This extra screening would have \"significant implications\" for embassies and consulates' operations, making a pause on new appointments necessary, the cable said.",
      "A senior State Department official confirmed the cable's accuracy to CBS News.",
      "The memo was first reported by Politico.",
      "When asked about student visas, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday, \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.\"",
      "A State Department official said Wednesday that while the department does not comment on internal communications, the scheduling of nonimmigrant visa interview appointments is \"dynamic.\" The official said that an embassy or consulate's capacity reflects the time required for consular officers to adjudicate the cases before them in full compliance with U.S. law, including to ensure applicants do not pose a security or safety risk to the United States.",
      "\"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision,\" the State Department official said, adding that every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. \"Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home.\"",
      "International students who want to study in the U.S. are typically required to schedule interviews at an American embassy or consulate, usually in their home country, as part of the visa application process. Wait times vary widely: At most embassies, appointments for student visa interviews can be scheduled less than two months in advance, though some diplomatic posts have longer waits.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would screen some visa applicants, including people seeking student visas, for what it called \"antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals.\"",
      "The screenings are part of a wider slate of controls aimed at international students \u2014 some of which have run into pushback from the court system.",
      "Last week, DHS told Harvard University it can no longer enroll international students, escalating a monthslong battle between the administration and the Ivy League school. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration is \"holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\" but Harvard said the move was illegal. A judge quickly blocked the policy.",
      "The government has sought to deport a handful of students based on their pro-Palestinian activism \u2014 some of whom have green cards, including Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 citing a law that allows visas to be revoked if somebody poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Lawyers argue these visa revocations violate students' First Amendment rights, though the government says it has the right to do so. Some students, including Mahdawi, have been released on bail.",

    "story": [
      "Jefferson City, Mo. \u2014 Planned Parenthood halted abortions in Missouri on Tuesday after the state's top court ordered new rulings in the tumultuous legal saga over a ban that voters struck down last November.",
      "The state's top court ruled that a district judge applied the wrong standard in rulings in December and February that allowed abortions to resume in the state. Nearly all abortions were halted under a ban that took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "In Tuesday's two-page ruling, the court ordered Judge Jerri Zhang to vacate her earlier orders and reevaluate the case using the standards the court laid out. Zhang ruled that she was allowing abortions to resume largely because advocates were likely to prevail in the case eventually. The Supreme Court said it should first consider whether there would be harms from allowing abortions to resume.",
      "The state emphasized in its petition filed to the state Supreme Court in March that Planned Parenthood didn't sufficiently prove women were harmed in the absence of the temporary blocks on the broad swath of laws and regulations on abortion services and providers. On the contrary, the state said Zhang's decisions left abortion facilities \"functionally unregulated\" and women with \"no guarantee of health and safety.\"",
      "Among the regulations that had been placed on hold were ones setting cleanliness standards for abortion facilities and requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles or 15 minutes of where an abortion is provided.",
      "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in a statement that \"today's decision from the Missouri Supreme Court is a win for women and children and sends a clear message - abortion providers must comply with state law regarding basic safety and sanitation requirements.\"",
      "Planned Parenthood maintains that those restrictions were specifically targeted to make it harder to access abortion.",
      "Still, the organization - which has the state's only abortion clinics - immediately started calling patients to cancel abortion appointments at clinics in Columbia and Kansas City, according to Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.",
      "Wales said it's a familiar but disappointing position for the organization.",
      "\"We have had to call patients in Missouri previously and say you were scheduled for care, your appointment is now canceled because of political interference, new restrictions, licensure overreach by the state,\" she said. \"To be in that position again, after the people of Missouri voted to ensure abortion access, is frustrating.\"",
      "Wales said Planned Parenthood hopes to be back in court soon.",
      "Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri, said he was \"extremely excited\" by the Supreme Court order.",
      "\"This means that our pro-life laws, which include many health and safety protections for women, will remain in place,\" Lee said. \"How long they will remain we will have to see.\"",
      "Missouri is the only state where voters have used a ballot measure to overturn a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. The Republican-controlled state government pushed back in court against allowing abortions to resume - something that didn't happen until more than three months after the amendment was adopted.",
      "Earlier this month, lawmakers approved another ballot measure for an amendment that would reimpose a ban - but with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. It could be on the ballot in 2026 or sooner.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after vote, protesters erupted with chants of \"Stop the ban!\" and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Before Tuesday's ruling, 12 states were enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and four more had bans that kicked in at around six weeks - often before women know they're pregnant.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk says he is \"disappointed\" by the price tag of the domestic policy bill\u00a0passed by Republicans in the House\u00a0last week and heavily backed by President Trump. The billionaire who recently stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, made the remark during an exclusive broadcast interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk's comments appear to put him at odds with Mr. Trump, who has championed the massive spending package. The legislation \u2014 which still needs to pass the Senate \u2014 would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts, boost border security spending, impose work requirements on Medicaid and roll back clean energy tax credits.",
      "The tax provisions of the package, titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" after Mr. Trump's name for the bill, would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk told CBS News, \"but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "Musk was a near-constant presence in the early months of the Trump administration, with his DOGE staffers sweeping through virtually every government agency to make widespread cuts \u2014 drawing concern from Democrats and even some Trump allies, as well as numerous legal challenges. Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X, has said he will dial back his involvement in government.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Monday he is pardoning\u00a0Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted of making several businessmen sworn law enforcement officers in exchange for cash bribes.",
      "Former Culpeper County Sheriff Jenkins, 53, was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in March. But on Monday, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Jenkins and his family \"have been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ.\"",
      "\"This Sheriff is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn't deserve to spend a single day in jail. He is a wonderful person, who was persecuted by the Radical Left \"monsters,\" and \"left for dead,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Jenkins' attorneys for comment.",
      "Jenkins was indicted in 2023 on 16 counts. In December, a jury found Jenkins guilty of one count of conspiracy, four counts of honest services fraud and seven counts of bribery. Jenkins appealed his conviction in April.",
      "Federal prosecutors say Jenkins took $75,000 worth of bribes. He allegedly accepted cash and campaign contributions from eight people \u2014 including two undercover FBI agents \u2014 and in return, gave them badges and made them auxiliary deputy sheriffs, despite not having any training or vetting. He also allegedly pushed officials to restore one bribe-payer's right to possess a gun as a convicted felon.",
      "Jenkins took the stand in his own defense and said there was no connection between the payments he received and the badges he handed out, according to news reports. Testifying against Jenkins were the undercover FBI agents who were sworn in as deputies in 2022 and immediately thereafter gave Jenkins envelopes with $5,000 and $10,000 cash, respectively.",
      "Trump said Jenkins tried to offer evidence in his defense, but U.S. District Judge Robert Ballou, a Biden appointee, \"refused to allow it, shut him down, and then went on a tirade.\"",
      "Acting United States Attorney Zachary T. Lee said at the time that Jenkins violated his oath of office \"and this case proves that when those officials use their authority for unjust personal enrichment, the Department of Justice will hold them accountable.\"",
      "A longstanding Trump supporter, Jenkins is the latest ally of the president to receive a pardon.",
      "On Mr. Trump's first day in office, he granted pardons and commutations to more than 1,000 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines-cdc-children-pregnant-women/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 20:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Kennedy's move appears to shortcut the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, dropping COVID vaccines from the list recommended for children and pregnant women.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated for COVID-19.",
      "\"I couldn't be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule,\" Kennedy said in a video attached to his post.",
      "However, as of Tuesday morning, the CDC had so far not updated the immunization schedule to reflect the removal announced by Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's move, announced Tuesday on X, appears to effectively shortcut a process set up by the agency's outside advisers to discuss and make changes to the CDC's influential vaccination guidance, which is directly tied to what insurers are required to cover and liability protections.",
      "Those advisers had already been weighing whether and how to narrow the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and other people with an underlying condition that put them at risk of more severe illness from COVID-19.",
      "Kennedy's announcement also goes further than the advisory panel, which had been weighing including pregnant women as among those who would remain eligible for COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, given their increased risk of severe disease and the fact that it could also help provide some protection to their newborns.",
      "It is not clear why Kennedy chose to announce the decision without waiting for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to complete its deliberations. The panel had been expected to vote on the issue at the routinely scheduled June meeting hosted by the agency.",
      "\"With the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, it is time to move forward. HHS and the CDC remain committed to gold standard science and to ensuring the health and well-being of all Americans \u2014 especially our nation's children \u2014 using common sense,\" Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email.",
      "Kennedy has also stalled other overdue recommendations from the panel for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccines and meningococcal vaccines.",
      "The committee had voted on updated recommendations for those vaccines in April. Usually it is up to the CDC director to approve the recommendations. But it has been up to Kennedy to decide whether to adopt the new guidance, since the Trump administration has not appointed an acting CDC director to replace Susan Monarez, who stepped aside from that role while she goes through the nomination process for CDC director.",
      "Only one recommendation from the April meeting, an update to restrict use of a Chikungunya vaccine linked to potentially severe side effects, has been greenlighted by Kennedy.",
      "HHS has not responded to requests for comment on why the other recommendations have been delayed.",
      "Can you still get a COVID vaccination for your children or if you're pregnant?",
      "While COVID-19 vaccines still remain available for now, experts say that access to the shots for children and during pregnancy could get harder once Kennedy's changes are official.",
      "The CDC's immunization guidance is closely watched by health experts because it serves as the basis for\u00a0legal requirements for which vaccines health insurance plans are required to cover with no cost-sharing.",
      "Removing the CDC's recommendations for children and pregnant women to be routinely vaccinated could mean those patients might have to start paying out of pocket for some or all of the cost of COVID-19 shots.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations also govern access to the shots through the federal Vaccines for Children program, which provides COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured children. Guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, requiring coverage of vaccinations to children and during pregnancy, is also tied to the CDC's recommendations.",
      "According to the CDC's price lists, the private sector price tag for COVID-19 vaccines starts at $57.50 per dose in children and $136.75 in adults.",
      "Another way that removing the recommendation could narrow availability of the shots is through the liability protections that Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response issued during the COVID-19 pandemic, expanding access to the shots for children in places like pharmacies.",
      "Spokespeople for CDC, ASPR and CMS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"That would essentially close the door to pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant women at pharmacies. And as we know, throughout the pandemic and over the last few years, the pharmacy has been the primary location where many have been receiving their vaccines,\" said Richard Dang, assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.",
      "Dang represents the American Pharmacists Association on the COVID-19 work group to CDC's vaccine advisers. He previously led the city COVID-19 vaccination program in Los Angeles.",
      "While Dang said there are other pathways for states to enable pharmacists to continue giving COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant patients, he warned those were challenging to implement and unlikely to resolve issues with insurance coverage of the shots caused by the change.",
      "\"Even if a pharmacy were allowed to administer vaccine off-label through a protocol or collaborative practice agreement, the individual patient would likely have to pay cash for it,\" Dang said.",
      "Why were COVID-19 vaccines recommended during pregnancy?",
      "The move also puts Kennedy at odds with his new officials at the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration, who\u00a0recently said\u00a0pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals.",
      "\"This one preventive strategy that is cost-effective, that can be readily available when the ACIP provides a universal recommendation, limits barriers to access. It is a really important mechanism to protect our moms and babies,\" said Dr. Naima Joseph, assistant professor at Boston University.",
      "Like Dang, Joseph is also a member of the COVID-19 work group to the CDC's vaccine advisers. Joseph represents the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",
      "A statement released by the OB-GYN organization Tuesday voiced frustration with Kennedy's move, warning that COVID infections during pregnancy \"can be catastrophic\" for families and that \"the science has not changed.\"",
      "Joseph said data still shows that pregnant people have an increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized. She also said newborns have no other way to get protection from the virus, outside of the mother's vaccination.",
      "\"Infants are the second leading group of our population being hospitalized. And when we look into those risks, it's really that they're born to moms who haven't received an updated COVID-19 vaccine,\" said Joseph.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment when asked why Kennedy was excluding pregnant moms from getting COVID-19 vaccines.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 19:30:19 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says he'll decide soon whether to take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public \u2014 a move that was vocally sought by Trump ally Bill Ackman.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump\u00a0said again Tuesday he's working to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president announced last week he was considering the move, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed Tuesday he is \"working on\" taking Fannie and Freddie public, but will continue overseeing the two enterprises even if their conservatorship ends. He also said the \"U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES\" to Fannie and Freddie, referring to the decades-old belief that the government would rescue Fannie and Freddie if needed, which likely keeps their borrowing costs low by making them appear safe to investors. It's unclear what form the \"guarantee\" could take in the future.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 18:59:36 -0400",
    "summary": "A lawyer told CBS News he discussed pardoning Stewart Rhodes with Justice Department pardon attorney Ed Martin.",
    "story": [
      "New Justice Department pardon attorney Ed Martin has discussed pardon applications for some of the only remaining Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants who weren't given full clemency by President Trump, including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, a lawyer told CBS News.",
      "Peter Ticktin, an attorney working to secure full pardons for a number of Jan. 6 defendants, told CBS News he met with Martin last week to discuss pardon requests for Rhodes and 10 others. Martin was in his first full week in his new job as pardon attorney after Mr. Trump withdrew his nomination to serve as U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C.",
      "Martin posted photos of his meeting with Ticktin on X last week, saying Ticktin had \"recommendations for pardons\" and \"I listened.\" CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "Ticktin said that in addition to a potential pardon for Rhodes, pardon applications were discussed for Proud Boys Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola. Ticktin also mentioned applications for Dan Wilson and Elias Costianes, two other Jan 6 defendants who still face prison sentences due to firearm charges unrelated to the Capitol riot.",
      "Politico was first to report on Ticktin's conversation about Rhodes.",
      "Mr. Trump issued pardons to almost everybody convicted over the Jan. 6 riot on the first day of his second term, and he directed any pending charges to be dropped.",
      "However, a group of 14 current and former members of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers \u2014 including Rhodes \u2014 were only given commutations that allowed them to leave prison but left their criminal convictions in place. Many of those defendants were found guilty of more serious charges, like conspiring to use force to resist the transfer of power and seditious conspiracy.",
      "More than 1,500 people were charged as a result of their alleged conduct on Jan. 6, and at least 1,100 have had their cases adjudicated and received sentences, according to Justice Department data. More than 700 defendants completed their sentences or did not receive sentences of incarceration. More than 170 people were accused of using a deadly or dangerous weapon, such as a fire extinguisher or bear spray, against police officers, prosecutors have said.",
      "Ticktin is working with Jan. 6 defendant Trenniss Evans, who was sentenced to 36 months of probation and 20 days of prison time for his actions on Jan. 6. He pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building in 2022.",
      "Evans, who is CEO of the conservative nonprofit American Rights Alliance, told CBS News his expectation is that the 11 pardon applications submitted to Martin will go through the standard review process. He said his group had so far received no assurances from Martin or the Justice Department on whether the pardons will be granted.",
      "\"The only assurances that we have is that we have people that are in the Justice Department now and in the proper places in the administration that are going to give a realistic and fair review to these cases because of the nauseating stance that the previous administration took against individuals related to January 6,\" Evans told CBS News.",
      "The next step in the pardon process, Ticktin said, is for Martin to consult with Alice Johnson, Mr. Trump's \"pardon czar,\" who was granted clemency in Mr. Trump's first term after more than two decades of prison time for a nonviolent drug offense.",
      "\"She's got a pretty important position at this point. I mean, she's the one that has to decide these things,\" Ticktin told CBS News. \"Pardons need to be given out, but at the same time, none should be given out, you know, indiscriminately.\"",
      "Ticktin said he is working with Mark McCloskey, the man who infamously pointed a firearm at Black Lives Matter protestors back in 2020, to file civil suits against the government for their treatment of Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "\"These are good American citizens, the kind of people that most people would enjoy being with, except that they were used as pawns here and incarcerated the way they were,\" Ticktin told CBS News.",
      "How Trump has used his pardon power",
      "So far in his second term, Mr. Trump has pardoned Democratic former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted on public corruption charges related to attempts to sell former President Barack Obama's old U.S. Senate seat, and Ross Ulbricht, who was sent to life in prison for his role in creating and operating the darknet market Silk Road.",
      "On Monday, Trump said he was pardoning Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted of making several businessmen sworn law enforcement officers in exchange for cash bribes.",
      "The Constitution gives presidents virtually limitless power to pardon people for federal crimes. Many presidents have drawn controversy for how they've used this power: Mr. Trump issued pardons in his first term to his former campaign chair Paul Manafort and his son-in-law's father Charles Kushner, while Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter and Bill Clinton pardoned financier Marc Rich. But legal experts say Mr. Trump's clemency for Jan. 6 rioters \u2014 including people convicted of assaulting law enforcement officers \u2014 has been particularly broad, especially after Mr. Trump previously said he planned on offering \"case-by-case\" pardons to riot defendants.",
      "Ticktin said that he also spoke to Martin about former Arkansas State Senator Jonathan Woods, who was sentenced in 2018 to more than 18 years in prison for a bribery scheme. Woods' case was prosecuted in part by former special counsel Jack Smith when he led the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section between 2010 and 2015, before prosecuting Mr. Trump.",

    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 17:21:38 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy issued a nationwide injunction in the dispute over deportations to third countries last month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to lift a lower court order that blocked immigration authorities from removing migrants to third countries without first providing them certain due process rights while a legal battle over President Trump's deportation efforts continues.",
      "The request for emergency relief from Solicitor General D. John Sauer stems from a preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy last month in a challenge brought by four migrants who are subject to final orders of removal.",
      "The district judge's order prevented the administration from deporting any migrant detainee unless it first provides written notice of the third country \u2014 one other than their home country \u2014 to which they may be removed, and gives them a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise a fear of torture, persecution or death in that third country, among other conditions. In his ruling, Murphy found it is likely that federal immigration officials \"have applied and will continue to apply the alleged policy of removing aliens to third countries without notice and an opportunity to be heard on fear-based claims \u2014 in other words, without due process.\"",
      "\"Defendants argue that the United States may send a deportable alien to a country not of their origin, not where an immigration judge has ordered, where they may be immediately tortured and killed, without providing that person any opportunity to tell the deporting authorities that they face grave danger or death because of such a deportation,\" Murphy wrote. \"All nine sitting justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, the assistant solicitor general of the United States, Congress, common sense, basic decency, and this court all disagree.\"",
      "But in seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer accused the district court of stalling the administration's efforts to remove what he described as \"some of the worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" Sauer wrote. \"In addition to usurping the Executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "The emergency appeal is the latest in which the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to step into the slew of legal battles targeting many aspects of President Trump's second-term agenda. But the president's policies on immigration, in particular, have created escalating showdowns with the federal judiciary.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's efforts to crack down on immigration, his administration has approached countries like Libya, Rwanda and Costa Rica to accept migrants who are not their citizens, according to documents obtained by CBS News. The Trump administration has already sent more than 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they are being detained at its notorious prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "Mr. Trump began his efforts to target migrants in the U.S. illegally on his first day back in the White House, when he directed the Department of Homeland Security to take action to detain and deport those who had been ordered removed but were still in the U.S.",
      "Following that directive, the department ordered immigration officials to \"determine the viability of removal to a third country\" for those migrants, which are deportations to a country other than the ones designated on an order of removal.",
      "The four migrants who brought the case now before the Supreme Court alleged that there are \"valid reasons to fear removal to specific countries\" that were not listed in their removal orders and said that their due process rights would be violated if the government did not provide them with notice and an opportunity to be heard before they were deported to a third country.",
      "The migrants first secured a temporary restraining order in late March, followed by the injunction in mid-April. The Trump administration appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, though it declined to immediately halt the district court's order.",
      "But as proceedings continued, lawyers told the court in a filing that migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared for removal to Libya, \"a country notorious for its human rights violations.\"",
      "Then, last week, immigration lawyers again told Murphy that they had received information that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam may have been boarded on a plane bound for South Sudan, in violation of his preliminary injunction. South Sudan has been engaged in a bloody civil war for more than a decade and the State Department has warned Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.\"",
      "On May 21, the Trump administration confirmed it had placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a removal flight to South Sudan. The judge then said that the government had \"unquestionably\" violated his order blocking deportations to third countries without providing migrants the chance to contest their removal and ordered the administration to give six deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews, with the opportunity to have a lawyer of their choosing present during the interview.",
      "Reasonable fear interviews typically assess whether a migrant can stay in the U.S. because of a risk of persecution or torture.",
      "The judge said the Department of Homeland Security could provide this process to six of the migrants either within the U.S. or abroad if the government \"retains custody and control\" over them.",
      "Following the judge's order, Mr. Trump confirmed that the migrant detainees were being held at a military base in Djibouti, a small African country.",
      "In his filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer lambasted the district court's orders, writing that \"the United States has been put to the intolerable choice of holding these aliens for additional proceedings at a military facility on foreign soil \u2014 where each day of their continued confinement risks grave harm to American foreign policy \u2014 or bringing these convicted criminals back to America.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's executive order urges agencies to take steps to suspend the security clearances of WilmerHale employees, terminate contracts with the law firm and limit federal employees from engaging with WilmerHale employees, among other things. WilmerHale sued the administration, arguing the president's executive order violates the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments, as well as the Constitution's separation of powers clause.",
      "Leon had firm words for the administration, including when he addressed the firm's First Amendment concerns. \"If you take on causes disfavored by President Trump, you will be punished!\" Leon wrote. \"Other firms facing similar executive orders have capitulated to President Trump.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 NPR on Tuesday sued President Trump and administration officials over an executive order signed earlier this month that seeks to cut federal funding to the news organization and PBS.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the suit was brought by NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations. It argues that Mr. Trump's executive order violates the First Amendment and provisions of the Public Broadcasting Act, which was passed by Congress in 1967. The plaintiffs also assert that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to stop federal funding for NPR and PBS, and his order should be invalidated as unconstitutional.",
      "The order, NPR and the three stations said in their complaint, is \"textbook retaliation\" and discriminates based on viewpoint, which is a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "\"The order's objectives could not be clearer: the order aims to punish NPR for the content of news and other programming the president dislikes and chill the free exercise of First Amendment rights by NPR and individual public radio stations across the country,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, claimed in a statement that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \"is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime. Therefore, the president is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The president was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have long complained about NPR and accused it of being biased against conservatives.\u00a0Project 2025, the sweeping policy roadmap overseen by the Heritage Foundation, calls for defunding both NPR and PBS.",
      "The president's executive order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides public dollars to NPR and PBS, and other federal agencies to \"cease federal funding\" and indirect funding for the two outlets. The directive said that taxpayers \"have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage.\" The White House has claimed that the two outlets \"receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "NPR is primarily funded through sponsorships, donations, memberships and licensing fees from local radio stations, and direct funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal grants, though only roughly 1% of its budget comes directly from federal dollars, according to NPR CEO Katherine Maher. For the 2024 fiscal year, NPR received roughly $11.1 million in grants from the corporation for programming and to support the Public Radio Satellite System, which is the country's public radio interconnection system.",
      "But the president's executive order targeting NPR and PBS was just one step he has taken to target public media. Last month, the president attempted to fire three officials with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was created by Congress in 1967 as a private nonprofit entity to ensure investment in public broadcasting. The corporation says it distributes more than 70% of its funding to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations.",
      "The ousted members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's board of directors sued the Trump administration over their removal, arguing the president did not have the power to fire them.",
      "In their lawsuit, NPR, Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio and KSUT Public Radio said that Mr. Trump's executive order violates the \"express will of Congress\" and their First Amendment rights. The news outlets warned that the president's directive \"threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.\"",
      "\"The Executive Order is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press. It is an affront to the rights of NPR and NPR's 246 Member stations, which are locally owned, nonprofit, noncommercial media organizations serving all 50 states and territories,\" Maher said in a statement. \"Today, we challenge its constitutionality in the nation's independent courts.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",

      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years after that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

    "published": "Wed, 28 May 2025 10:05:03 -0400",
    "summary": "After back-to-back Starship upper stage failures, SpaceX on Tuesday again launched the world's most powerful rocket, but faced new problems.",
    "story": [
      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

      "Johann Strauss II's \"Blue Danube\" is heading into space this month to mark the 200th anniversary of the waltz king's birth.",
      "The classical piece will be beamed into the cosmos as it's performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The celestial send-off on May 31 \u2014 livestreamed with free public screenings in Vienna, Madrid and New York \u2014 also will celebrate the European Space Agency's founding 50 years ago.",
      "Although the music could be converted into radio signals in real time, according to officials, ESA will relay a pre-recorded version from the orchestra's rehearsal the day before to avoid any technical issues. The live performance will provide the accompaniment.",
      "The radio signals will hurtle away at the speed of light, or a mind-blowing 670 million mph (more than 1 billion kph).",
      "That will put the music past the moon in 1 \u00bd seconds, past Mars in 4 \u00bd minutes, past Jupiter in 37 minutes and past Neptune in four hours. Within 23 hours, the signals will be as far from Earth as NASA's Voyager 1, the world's most distant spacecraft at more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) in interstellar space.",
      "NASA also celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 by transmitting a song directly into deep space: the Beatles' \"Across the Universe.\" And last year, NASA beamed up Missy Elliott's\u00a0\"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" toward Venus.",
      "Music has even flowed from another planet to Earth \u2014 courtesy of a NASA Mars rover. Flight controllers at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent a recording of will.i.am's \"Reach for the Stars\" to Curiosity in 2012 and the rover relayed it back.",
      "These are all deep-space transmissions as opposed to the melodies streaming between NASA's Mission Control and orbiting crews since the mid-1960s.",
      "Now it's Strauss' turn, after getting passed over for the Voyager Golden Records nearly a half-century ago.",
      "Launched in 1977, NASA's twin Voyagers 1 and 2 each carry a gold-plated copper phonograph record, along with a stylus and playing instructions for anyone or anything out there.",
      "The records contain sounds and images of Earth as well as 90 minutes of music. The late astronomer Carl Sagan led the committee that chose Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Stravinsky pieces, along with modern and Indigenous selections.",
      "Among those skipped was Strauss, whose \"Blue Danube\" graced Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi opus \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"",
      "The tourist board in Vienna, where Strauss was born on Oct. 25, 1825, said it aims to correct this \"cosmic mistake\" by sending the \"the most famous of all waltzes\" to its destined home among the stars.",
      "ESA's big radio antenna in Spain, part of the space agency's deep-space network, will do the honors. The dish will be pointed in the direction of Voyager 1 so the \"Blue Danube\" heads that way.",
      "\"Music connects us all through time and space in a very particular way,\" ESA's director general Josef Aschbacher said in a statement. \"The European Space Agency is pleased to share the stage with Johann Strauss II and open the imaginations of future space scientists and explorers who may one day journey to the anthem of space.\"",

      "Divine Right",
      "Everyone else had arrived, but Elon Musk was late as usual. It was the summer of 2015, and a group of men had gathered for a private dinner at Sam Altman's invitation to discuss the future of AI and humanity.",
      "Musk had met Altman, fourteen years his junior, a while earlier and had formed a good impression. President of the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, Altman's reputation preceded him. After starting his first company at age nineteen, he had rapidly established himself within Silicon Valley as a brilliant strategist and dealmaker with grand ambitions, even for the land of big\u2011thinking founders. Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like\u2011minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. It was as if, Musk would describe in a lawsuit years later, Altman had mirrored everything Musk had ever said about the subject to win his trust.",
      "For Altman's part, he often said that Musk had been a childhood hero. After the older entrepreneur had shown him around the sprawling SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, that admiration had only deepened. \"The thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars,\" Altman wrote later of the experience. \"I left thinking 'huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like.'\"",
      "Musk had been deeply concerned about AI for some time. In 2012, he'd met Demis Hassabis, the professorial CEO of the London\u2011based AI lab DeepMind Technologies. Shortly thereafter, Hassabis had also paid Musk a visit at his SpaceX factory. As the two men sat in the canteen, surrounded by the sounds of massive rocket parts being transported and assembled, Hassabis raised the possibility that more advanced AI, of the kind that might one day exceed human intelligence, could pose a threat to humanity. What's more, Musk's fail\u2011safe of colonizing Mars to escape would not work in this scenario. Superintelligence, Hassabis said with amusement, would simply follow humans into the galaxy. Musk, decidedly less amused, invested $5 million in DeepMind to keep tabs on the company.",
      "Later, at his 2013 birthday party in the lush wine\u2011growing landscapes of Napa Valley, Musk had gotten into a heated and emotional debate with his longtime friend and Google cofounder Larry Page over whether AI surpassing human intelligence was in fact a problem. Page didn't think so, calling it the next stage of evolution. When Musk balked, Page accused him of being a \"specist,\" discriminating against nonhuman species.",
      "After that, Musk began to speak incessantly about the existential risk of AI. At an MIT symposium, he described AI as probably the \"biggest existential threat\" to humanity and its development as \"summoning the demon.\" He met with publishers in New York, gripped by the thought of writing his own book about extinction\u2011level threats, including AI. Later, at a recurring AI Salon event at Stanford, a young researcher named Timnit Gebru would come up to him after a talk and ask him why he was so obsessed with AI when the threat of climate change was more clearly existential. \"Climate change is bad, but it's not going to kill everyone,\" he said. \"AI could render humanity extinct.\"",

      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",

      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",

      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing.

    "story": [
      "U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who took charge of the department in the difficult months after the U.S. Capitol siege, is retiring from his position Friday. After the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, he helped rebuild the department's shrunken staff, beefed up recruitment efforts and bolstered the agency's intelligence operations and communications to fix weaknesses revealed by the breach of the Capitol.",
      "Manger told CBS News he faced stiff challenges when he arrived on the job in 2021.",
      "\"The department as a whole had lost confidence in the (prior) leadership as a result of what happened,\" he said. \"And there were big things that were identified as things that needed to be fixed as quickly as we could fix them: Things like the intelligence failures, the communication failures, the equipment failures, the training failures, the leadership failures \u2014 all of those things needed to be addressed immediately.\"",
      "Manger, a former local police chief in Fairfax County, Virginia, and Montgomery County, Maryland, successfully advocated for increases in funding to improve hiring, equipment and operations.",
      "The department was blasted by critics for intelligence failures that contributed to the violation of the complex on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"We now have a world class intelligence operation. We are significant players in the intelligence community in the Washington, D.C., region and, frankly, all over the country,\" Manger said. \"Whereas before, we were basically just\u2014 ... we were consumers of information. The FBI would give us intelligence, other agencies would give us intelligence. Now we are gathering our own.\"",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police Board will select a new police chief, which Manger predicts will happen soon.",
      "Manger has requested nearly $1 billion in funding for 2026, which would represent the latest in a series of recent budget boosts for the department. In testimony before a congressional committee on justifying his budget request, Manger cited an elevated number of investigations into threats against members of Congress.",
      "\"The current climate of threats has reached alarming levels,\" he told the committee in April. Capitol Police records show the number of threats launched against congressional members in 2024 exceeded 9,400.",
      "He added, \"Social media and the internet provide a breeding ground for threats that \u2014 regardless of their nature \u2014 the department must investigate.\"",
      "Manger and the Capitol Police have also bolstered the department's operations outside of Washington, responding to potential threats in the hometowns of lawmakers.",
      "The department has a unique mission among police agencies, protecting elected leaders and securing the U.S. Capitol campus, which hosts over 3 million visitors each year. The Capitol is open to the public, and lawmakers are accessible to citizens.",
      "Manger has been critical of the pardons issued by President Trump to free Capitol rioters who beat, clubbed and gassed Capitol Police and other officers during the attack on the Capitol. He told CBS News that when Mr. Trump issued 1,500 pardons to the suspected and convicted rioters when he took office, it \"was probably one of my worst days in this job.\"",
      "He also blasted conspiracy theories about Jan. 6 that continue to circulate on social media.",
      "\"My folks were here on Jan. 6. They were part of what went on. They were assaulted,\" Manger said. \"They were in fights. Many of them were injured. They know exactly what happened on Jan. 6. For somebody to make up some story that, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad,' \u2014 it is just not true.\"",
      "\"What a chilling message to law enforcement, because we've got a job to do, and we don't care what the issue is,\" Manger continued. \"We don't care what side of the coin you're on on any particular issue because we have a job to do, to maintain public order and to keep the peace.\"",
      "Rep. Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, said of Manger, \"Since taking over at the department's hour of greatest need, he professionalized a force in need of steady leadership.\"",
      "A union representative for Capitol Police officers told CBS News, \"Manpower is still an issue, as well as balancing work and family life for the rank and file officers, which continues to plague morale within the agency.\"",
      "As he prepares to leave the department, Manger was lauded by one of the former Capitol Police officers who responded to the Jan. 6 riot. Former officer Harry Dunn told CBS News, \"He showed his love for country, his love for law enforcement and his continued dedication to public service.\"",

    "summary": "It doesn't take $1 million to secure a sense of financial well-being, according to new research from Vanguard.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for an $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 28 May 2025 10:05:03 -0400",
    "summary": "After back-to-back Starship upper stage failures, SpaceX on Tuesday again launched the world's most powerful rocket, but faced new problems.",
    "story": [
      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

    "published": "Wed, 28 May 2025 08:16:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's why young workers with college degree are faring poorly in the labor market, according to a report.",
    "story": [
      "Recent college graduates are having a harder time finding work, despite their higher education degrees, which usually give job-seekers a leg up in the labor market.",
      "That's according to a new report from Oxford Economics which shows that unemployed recent college grads account for 12% of an 85% rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. That's a high number, given that this cohort only makes up 5% of the total labor force.",
      "What's more, the rate of unemployment among workers who have recently graduated from college and are between the ages of 22 and 27, is nearing 6% \u2014which is above the national unemployment rate of 4.2%.",
      "\"People who have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher have a higher unemployment rate than national average, and this is the first time this has happened in the last 45 years of data,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That's noteworthy, he said, because \"those with higher educational attainment usually have better prospects overall than their peer with less.\"",
      "So why are recent college grads are having a tougher time finding work post-college than previous graduating classes did?",
      "While the report points to a couple of factors, it finds that a slowdown in hiring in formerly hot sectors is driving the growth in unemployment among degree holders.",
      "\"The rise in the recent graduate unemployment rate is largely part of a mismatch between an oversupply of recent graduates in fields where business demand has waned,\" according to the report.",
      "That holds especially true in the tech industry, as more college students graduate with degrees in computer science and related fields than any other major.",
      "\"Prospects for employment will remain minimal for these individuals, keeping the unemployment rate elevated in the near term,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in the report.",
      "Tech sector-centric",
      "Computer science is among the fastest-growing fields of study among undergrads, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, but jobs in the sector are particularly vulnerable to replacement by automation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence also expose workers in the field to being rendered obsolete.",
      "\"There's a mismatch between business demand and the labor supply overall,\" Martin said. \"And it's very concentrated in the technology sector.\"",
      "The industry hired at a fast clip when the economy reopened post-pandemic, before pulling back. Those cuts are likely still affecting the current unemployment rate, according to Martin.",
      "\"Some of it could be a normalization after the tech sector's hiring surge at the end of the pandemic around 2021,\" he said. \"But there's also evidence that AI is starting to impact lower-level computer science gigs,\" he added.",
      "Experienced workers who graduated with computer science degrees but have racked up more than a few years of experience are faring fine, noted Martin. It's those who do the kind of lower-level, rote work that AI is already adept at, who are seeing a mismatch between the number of jobs available and the supply of workers seeking them.",
      "\"Some of it might be businesses being productive with the workers they have and not wanting to increase costs overall by hiring. It could also be higher adoption rates of AI,\" Martin said. \"At the moment, it looks to be a bit of both.\"",
      "Uncertainty slows hiring",
      "Economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's aggressive, yet ever-changing tariff agenda, is also leading a number of businesses to press pause on growth and investment. Because of this, the unemployment rate among recent college graduates could continue to inch upward, according to Martin.",
      "\"We are heading into a period where uncertainty is really high; the impact of tariffs is starting to bleed through, and businesses are facing higher input costs,\" he said.",
      "Although recent college graduates who have secured employment aren't being laid off at higher rates than the rest of the workforce, Martin doesn't expect things to get easier for young graduates on the hunt for employment, absent a surge in hiring by tech companies or mass exodus of workers from the labor force.",
      "\"There is some softening in demand overall, but a lot of it is concentrated at the moment in recent college graduates, and we are looking for the unemployment rate to rise,\" he said.",
      "The \"underemployment\" effect",
      "When qualified workers with college degrees try and fail to find work in their desired field, they tend to continue seeking work, sometimes looking for a job in another sector, as opposed to withdrawing from the labor force, the report notes. That can lead to college-educated workers finding themselves \"underemployed,\" or in roles where 50% of the workers who occupy them do not have a bachelor's degree or higher.",
      "This scenario can doom them for years to come: Underemployed workers tend to remain so for the rest of their careers, according to a report.",

    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 20:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Kennedy's move appears to shortcut the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, dropping COVID vaccines from the list recommended for children and pregnant women.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated for COVID-19.",
      "\"I couldn't be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule,\" Kennedy said in a video attached to his post.",
      "However, as of Tuesday morning, the CDC had so far not updated the immunization schedule to reflect the removal announced by Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's move, announced Tuesday on X, appears to effectively shortcut a process set up by the agency's outside advisers to discuss and make changes to the CDC's influential vaccination guidance, which is directly tied to what insurers are required to cover and liability protections.",
      "Those advisers had already been weighing whether and how to narrow the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and other people with an underlying condition that put them at risk of more severe illness from COVID-19.",
      "Kennedy's announcement also goes further than the advisory panel, which had been weighing including pregnant women as among those who would remain eligible for COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, given their increased risk of severe disease and the fact that it could also help provide some protection to their newborns.",
      "It is not clear why Kennedy chose to announce the decision without waiting for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to complete its deliberations. The panel had been expected to vote on the issue at the routinely scheduled June meeting hosted by the agency.",
      "\"With the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, it is time to move forward. HHS and the CDC remain committed to gold standard science and to ensuring the health and well-being of all Americans \u2014 especially our nation's children \u2014 using common sense,\" Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email.",
      "Kennedy has also stalled other overdue recommendations from the panel for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccines and meningococcal vaccines.",
      "The committee had voted on updated recommendations for those vaccines in April. Usually it is up to the CDC director to approve the recommendations. But it has been up to Kennedy to decide whether to adopt the new guidance, since the Trump administration has not appointed an acting CDC director to replace Susan Monarez, who stepped aside from that role while she goes through the nomination process for CDC director.",
      "Only one recommendation from the April meeting, an update to restrict use of a Chikungunya vaccine linked to potentially severe side effects, has been greenlighted by Kennedy.",
      "HHS has not responded to requests for comment on why the other recommendations have been delayed.",
      "Can you still get a COVID vaccination for your children or if you're pregnant?",
      "While COVID-19 vaccines still remain available for now, experts say that access to the shots for children and during pregnancy could get harder once Kennedy's changes are official.",
      "The CDC's immunization guidance is closely watched by health experts because it serves as the basis for\u00a0legal requirements for which vaccines health insurance plans are required to cover with no cost-sharing.",
      "Removing the CDC's recommendations for children and pregnant women to be routinely vaccinated could mean those patients might have to start paying out of pocket for some or all of the cost of COVID-19 shots.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations also govern access to the shots through the federal Vaccines for Children program, which provides COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured children. Guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, requiring coverage of vaccinations to children and during pregnancy, is also tied to the CDC's recommendations.",
      "According to the CDC's price lists, the private sector price tag for COVID-19 vaccines starts at $57.50 per dose in children and $136.75 in adults.",
      "Another way that removing the recommendation could narrow availability of the shots is through the liability protections that Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response issued during the COVID-19 pandemic, expanding access to the shots for children in places like pharmacies.",
      "Spokespeople for CDC, ASPR and CMS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"That would essentially close the door to pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant women at pharmacies. And as we know, throughout the pandemic and over the last few years, the pharmacy has been the primary location where many have been receiving their vaccines,\" said Richard Dang, assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.",
      "Dang represents the American Pharmacists Association on the COVID-19 work group to CDC's vaccine advisers. He previously led the city COVID-19 vaccination program in Los Angeles.",
      "While Dang said there are other pathways for states to enable pharmacists to continue giving COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant patients, he warned those were challenging to implement and unlikely to resolve issues with insurance coverage of the shots caused by the change.",
      "\"Even if a pharmacy were allowed to administer vaccine off-label through a protocol or collaborative practice agreement, the individual patient would likely have to pay cash for it,\" Dang said.",
      "Why were COVID-19 vaccines recommended during pregnancy?",
      "The move also puts Kennedy at odds with his new officials at the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration, who\u00a0recently said\u00a0pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals.",
      "\"This one preventive strategy that is cost-effective, that can be readily available when the ACIP provides a universal recommendation, limits barriers to access. It is a really important mechanism to protect our moms and babies,\" said Dr. Naima Joseph, assistant professor at Boston University.",
      "Like Dang, Joseph is also a member of the COVID-19 work group to the CDC's vaccine advisers. Joseph represents the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",
      "A statement released by the OB-GYN organization Tuesday voiced frustration with Kennedy's move, warning that COVID infections during pregnancy \"can be catastrophic\" for families and that \"the science has not changed.\"",
      "Joseph said data still shows that pregnant people have an increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized. She also said newborns have no other way to get protection from the virus, outside of the mother's vaccination.",
      "\"Infants are the second leading group of our population being hospitalized. And when we look into those risks, it's really that they're born to moms who haven't received an updated COVID-19 vaccine,\" said Joseph.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment when asked why Kennedy was excluding pregnant moms from getting COVID-19 vaccines.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy issued a nationwide injunction in the dispute over deportations to third countries last month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to lift a lower court order that blocked immigration authorities from removing migrants to third countries without first providing them certain due process rights while a legal battle over President Trump's deportation efforts continues.",
      "The request for emergency relief from Solicitor General D. John Sauer stems from a preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy last month in a challenge brought by four migrants who are subject to final orders of removal.",
      "The district judge's order prevented the administration from deporting any migrant detainee unless it first provides written notice of the third country \u2014 one other than their home country \u2014 to which they may be removed, and gives them a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise a fear of torture, persecution or death in that third country, among other conditions. In his ruling, Murphy found it is likely that federal immigration officials \"have applied and will continue to apply the alleged policy of removing aliens to third countries without notice and an opportunity to be heard on fear-based claims \u2014 in other words, without due process.\"",
      "\"Defendants argue that the United States may send a deportable alien to a country not of their origin, not where an immigration judge has ordered, where they may be immediately tortured and killed, without providing that person any opportunity to tell the deporting authorities that they face grave danger or death because of such a deportation,\" Murphy wrote. \"All nine sitting justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, the assistant solicitor general of the United States, Congress, common sense, basic decency, and this court all disagree.\"",
      "But in seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer accused the district court of stalling the administration's efforts to remove what he described as \"some of the worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" Sauer wrote. \"In addition to usurping the Executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "The emergency appeal is the latest in which the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to step into the slew of legal battles targeting many aspects of President Trump's second-term agenda. But the president's policies on immigration, in particular, have created escalating showdowns with the federal judiciary.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's efforts to crack down on immigration, his administration has approached countries like Libya, Rwanda and Costa Rica to accept migrants who are not their citizens, according to documents obtained by CBS News. The Trump administration has already sent more than 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they are being detained at its notorious prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "Mr. Trump began his efforts to target migrants in the U.S. illegally on his first day back in the White House, when he directed the Department of Homeland Security to take action to detain and deport those who had been ordered removed but were still in the U.S.",
      "Following that directive, the department ordered immigration officials to \"determine the viability of removal to a third country\" for those migrants, which are deportations to a country other than the ones designated on an order of removal.",
      "The four migrants who brought the case now before the Supreme Court alleged that there are \"valid reasons to fear removal to specific countries\" that were not listed in their removal orders and said that their due process rights would be violated if the government did not provide them with notice and an opportunity to be heard before they were deported to a third country.",
      "The migrants first secured a temporary restraining order in late March, followed by the injunction in mid-April. The Trump administration appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, though it declined to immediately halt the district court's order.",
      "But as proceedings continued, lawyers told the court in a filing that migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared for removal to Libya, \"a country notorious for its human rights violations.\"",
      "Then, last week, immigration lawyers again told Murphy that they had received information that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam may have been boarded on a plane bound for South Sudan, in violation of his preliminary injunction. South Sudan has been engaged in a bloody civil war for more than a decade and the State Department has warned Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.\"",
      "On May 21, the Trump administration confirmed it had placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a removal flight to South Sudan. The judge then said that the government had \"unquestionably\" violated his order blocking deportations to third countries without providing migrants the chance to contest their removal and ordered the administration to give six deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews, with the opportunity to have a lawyer of their choosing present during the interview.",
      "Reasonable fear interviews typically assess whether a migrant can stay in the U.S. because of a risk of persecution or torture.",
      "The judge said the Department of Homeland Security could provide this process to six of the migrants either within the U.S. or abroad if the government \"retains custody and control\" over them.",
      "Following the judge's order, Mr. Trump confirmed that the migrant detainees were being held at a military base in Djibouti, a small African country.",
      "In his filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer lambasted the district court's orders, writing that \"the United States has been put to the intolerable choice of holding these aliens for additional proceedings at a military facility on foreign soil \u2014 where each day of their continued confinement risks grave harm to American foreign policy \u2014 or bringing these convicted criminals back to America.\"",

The upswing follows month of decline in the index, triggered by fears of inflation and tariff-induced economic uncertainty. Analysts, however, warned the positive turnaround may be short-lived.",

She posted a $1,500 personal recognizance bond on May 17, the same day she was taken into custody, according to the West Virginia Magistrate Court in the county where it happened.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order in early May that seeks to end federal funds for NPR and PBS.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 NPR on Tuesday sued President Trump and administration officials over an executive order signed earlier this month that seeks to cut federal funding to the news organization and PBS.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the suit was brought by NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations. It argues that Mr. Trump's executive order violates the First Amendment and provisions of the Public Broadcasting Act, which was passed by Congress in 1967. The plaintiffs also assert that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to stop federal funding for NPR and PBS, and his order should be invalidated as unconstitutional.",
      "The order, NPR and the three stations said in their complaint, is \"textbook retaliation\" and discriminates based on viewpoint, which is a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "\"The order's objectives could not be clearer: the order aims to punish NPR for the content of news and other programming the president dislikes and chill the free exercise of First Amendment rights by NPR and individual public radio stations across the country,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, claimed in a statement that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \"is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime. Therefore, the president is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The president was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have long complained about NPR and accused it of being biased against conservatives.\u00a0Project 2025, the sweeping policy roadmap overseen by the Heritage Foundation, calls for defunding both NPR and PBS.",
      "The president's executive order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides public dollars to NPR and PBS, and other federal agencies to \"cease federal funding\" and indirect funding for the two outlets. The directive said that taxpayers \"have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage.\" The White House has claimed that the two outlets \"receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "NPR is primarily funded through sponsorships, donations, memberships and licensing fees from local radio stations, and direct funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal grants, though only roughly 1% of its budget comes directly from federal dollars, according to NPR CEO Katherine Maher. For the 2024 fiscal year, NPR received roughly $11.1 million in grants from the corporation for programming and to support the Public Radio Satellite System, which is the country's public radio interconnection system.",
      "But the president's executive order targeting NPR and PBS was just one step he has taken to target public media. Last month, the president attempted to fire three officials with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was created by Congress in 1967 as a private nonprofit entity to ensure investment in public broadcasting. The corporation says it distributes more than 70% of its funding to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations.",
      "The ousted members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's board of directors sued the Trump administration over their removal, arguing the president did not have the power to fire them.",
      "In their lawsuit, NPR, Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio and KSUT Public Radio said that Mr. Trump's executive order violates the \"express will of Congress\" and their First Amendment rights. The news outlets warned that the president's directive \"threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.\"",
      "\"The Executive Order is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press. It is an affront to the rights of NPR and NPR's 246 Member stations, which are locally owned, nonprofit, noncommercial media organizations serving all 50 states and territories,\" Maher said in a statement. \"Today, we challenge its constitutionality in the nation's independent courts.\"",

    "summary": "As the Trump administration moves to limit COVID booster vaccines for some, here's what to know about the latest variant NB.1.8.1 and its symptoms.",
    "story": [
      "Cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a large surge in China, have\u00a0been detected in multiple locations across the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The earliest cases in the U.S. date back to late March and early April, and were detected through a screening program at airports for arriving international travelers.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement last week.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "But hospitalizations abroad have raised questions about the new variant, its symptoms and more. Here's what to know, according to experts.",
      "New COVID variant's symptoms",
      "NB.1.8.1 is associated with symptoms that are \"broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains of the virus,\" Subhash Verma, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "Commonly reported symptoms include respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic effects like fever and fatigue, he said.",
      "How dangerous is the new COVID variant?",
      "\"Data indicates that NB.1.8.1 does not lead to more severe illness compared to previous variants, although it appears to have a growth advantage, suggesting it may spread more easily,\" Verma said. \"In other words, it is more transmissible.\"",
      "Authorities in Hong Kong\u00a0say\u00a0there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe than previous strains.",
      "Dr. Amy Edwards, assistant professor of pediatrics at the School of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University who specializes in infectious diseases, also told CBS News there is some evidence in the lab that this variant binds more tightly to human cells, which means it is easier to transmit. But, that doesn't mean it leads to more severe infection.",
      "\"What they're seeing in China, Hong Kong and some other areas where this variant has really surged, is an increase in hospitalization, but that seems to be more to do with just a standard summer surge that we've been seeing,\" Edwards explained, adding the available data is still preliminary, but that the variant \"doesn't seem to be more severe.\"",
      "2025 COVID booster shot",
      "Despite the latest variant displaying high transmissibility, the Trump administration is planning to limit booster vaccine access to some groups.",
      "Last week, the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration\u00a0said it will continue approving\u00a0COVID-19 vaccine\u00a0updates for seniors and those with an\u00a0underlying medical condition, including pregnancy or diabetes, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "Verma said these restrictions could have several significant public health impacts.",
      "\"Although over 100 million Americans are still expected to qualify under these criteria, the administration's decision introduces new barriers for the broader population,\" he said. \"One immediate concern is that the FDA's requirement for updated clinical trials could delay access to boosters for lower-risk groups, discouraging some individuals from seeking vaccination. The new policy may also create confusion and reduce vaccination rates if people are uncertain about their eligibility or worried about insurance coverage, particularly with high-cost manufacturers planning to charge.\"",
      "Edwards said the recommendation updates remain unclear.",
      "\"Some of the language around pre-existing conditions is pretty loose,\" she explained. \"The other thing is, it's not clear what variants are going to be in this year's vaccine, especially with some question around what kind of vaccine trials are going to be allowed.\"",
      "The new COVID-19 vaccination framework was laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has publicly raised doubts about vaccines.",
      "\"We had heard Secretary Kennedy say, we're not going to take away your vaccines, we're going to be super transparent. And in fact, what is happening is people are going to lose access to vaccines,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\" following the FDA's announcement about vaccine approvals.",
      "Are there other ways to prevent infection?",
      "With questions about vaccine access up in the air, Edwards said there are still strategies for prevention.",
      "\"Good cough and sneezing hygiene, good hand washing, staying home if you're not feeling well to keep other people from catching what you've got,\" Edwards advised. \"If you're a little under the weather, but well enough to be out and about, wearing a mask.\"",
      "Despite some controversy around mask wearing, Edwards said they can prevent spread by keeping your germs to yourself.",
      "\"One of the places where masks have long been known to be the most effective is in preventing someone who's ill from passing that infection to other people,\" she said. \"So if I've got a slight sore throat, little bit of sniffles, obviously, that might not be enough to keep me home, but if I put a mask on, I can reduce the risk that I would transmit whatever I'm carrying to other people. And that's not just for COVID. That's any respiratory virus.\"",

The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",

      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",

      "In a cable dated Tuesday and obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts not to add any more appointments for student and foreign exchange visas in preparation for the expanded vetting, and to take any unfilled appointments off their calendars. If students have already scheduled their visa interviews, those can still go forward.",
      "The pause will last \"until further guidance is issued\" in the next few days.",
      "The State Department is preparing for an \"expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" and all student visa applicants could be subject to social media checks, according to the cable. This extra screening would have \"significant implications\" for embassies and consulates' operations, making a pause on new appointments necessary, the cable said.",
      "A senior State Department official confirmed the cable's accuracy to CBS News.",

      "When asked about student visas, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday, \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.\"",
      "A State Department official said Wednesday that while the department does not comment on internal communications, the scheduling of nonimmigrant visa interview appointments is \"dynamic.\" The official said that an embassy or consulate's capacity reflects the time required for consular officers to adjudicate the cases before them in full compliance with U.S. law, including to ensure applicants do not pose a security or safety risk to the United States.",
      "\"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision,\" the State Department official said, adding that every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. \"Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home.\"",
      "International students who want to study in the U.S. are typically required to schedule interviews at an American embassy or consulate, usually in their home country, as part of the visa application process. Wait times vary widely: At most embassies, appointments for student visa interviews can be scheduled less than two months in advance, though some diplomatic posts have longer waits.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would screen some visa applicants, including people seeking student visas, for what it called \"antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals.\"",

      "\"It was taken into account that the acts committed are of particular gravity due to the number of victims, their young age and the compulsive nature\" of the crimes, said the verdict.",
      "But the court rejected a rare demand from prosecutors that he should be held in a center for treatment and supervision even after any release, citing his \"desire to make amends\" for what he had done.",
      "The prosecutor has said last week that in the United States \u2014 where the opposite is the case \u2014 Le Scouarnec could have been jailed for \"2,000 years.\"",
      "In this trial, which began in February in Vannes in the western region of Brittany, Le Scouarnec has admitted sexually assaulting or raping 299 patients \u2014 256 of them under 15 \u2014 in hospitals between 1989 and 2014, many while they were under anesthesia or waking up after operations.",
      "He was charged with 111 rapes and 189 sexual assaults.",
      "In March, during the trial, Le Scouarnec admitted without any solicitation that he had sexually abused his own granddaughter, too, though she was not among the alleged victims in the case.",
      "The former surgeon stood up and addressed the court just after his eldest son, whose name has not been used in the trial, gave evidence.",
      "\"This is possibly, almost certainly, the last time I will see my son, because I heard his anger and his distress,\" Le Scouarnec told the court that day. \"I respect that anger, it is well-founded. Yes, I admit to having abused my granddaughter, his daughter.\"",
      "He then turned to his son and said, \"forgive me.\"",
      "Survivors of the surgeon's abuse staged a protest outside the court in Vannes, holding signs such as \"Never again\" and \"I accuse you.\"",
      "They also held signs representing 355 victims of Le Scouarnec.",
      "That number included \"forgotten victims and those whose cases have been dismissed,\" said Manon Lemoine, one of the victims.",
      "\"We want to be together,\" she said.",
      "Another victim, Celine Mahuteau, on Wednesday sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron saying that France has not implemented a national policy \"to prevent pedophilia.\"",
      "\"I am not asking the court for leniency,\" Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement on Monday.",
      "\"Simply grant me the right to become a better person,\" he said.",
      "One of the lawyers, Maxime Tessier, had asked the court to take into account the \"exceptional\" nature of Le Scouarnec's confession when he admitted all the charges against him.",
      "The retired surgeon also said he considered himself \"responsible\" for the death of two of his victims \u2014 Mathis Vinet, who died after an overdose in 2021 in what his family says was suicide, and another man who was found dead in 2020.",
      "Le Scouarnec documented his crimes, noting his victims' names, ages, addresses and the nature of the abuse.",
      "In his notes, the doctor described himself as a \"major pervert\" and a \"pedophile.\"",
      "\"And I am very happy about it,\" he recorded.",
      "Victims and child rights advocates say the case highlights systemic failures that allowed Le Scouarnec to repeatedly commit sexual crimes.",
      "In 2005, he received a four-month suspended prison sentence after investigators linked his credit card to the online purchase of child sexual abuse material.",
      "But Le Scouarnec was neither required to undergo treatment nor barred from practicing medicine.",
      "While Le Scouarnec has asked his victims for forgiveness, many of them have questioned the sincerity of his apologies, which he repeated almost mechanically over the weeks of the trial.",
      "\"You are the worst mass pedophile who ever lived,\" said one of the lawyers representing the victims, Thomas Delaby, describing Le Scouarnec as an \"atomic bomb of pedophilia.\"",
      "There has been frustration among some that the trial has not had the impact in France they hoped for.",
      "The case has not won the attention given to the case of Dominique Pelicot, who was jailed last year for recruiting dozens of strangers to rape his now ex-wife Gisele.",
      "But Health Minister Yannick Neuder said on Wednesday he would work with Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin to ensure that \"never again will we find ourselves in a situation where patients and vulnerable children\" are exposed to predators.",

      "Onosato, whose real name is Daiki Nakamura, is only 24 and was promoted Wednesday to sumo's top rank by the Japan Sumo Association. Onosato was promoted by winning last week's Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, which came after he won another prestigious tournament in March.",
      "Onosato is from Ishikawa prefecture, which was hit on Jan. 1, 2024, by a devastating earthquake and tsunami that killed about 600 people in the prefecture and caused widespread damage. Much of the destruction was centered on an area known as the Noto Peninsula.",

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",

Joseph Harris-Birtill, born on November 23, 2021, was admitted to the organization at the age of just two years and 182 days.",
      "\"It soon became clear that he was an exceptional little being,\" Harris-Birtill's mother Rose told Guinness World Records. \"He first rolled over at five weeks, said his first word at seven months, and read his first book out loud from cover to cover at one-and-three-quarter years.\"",
      "\"He's learning morse code, knows the Greek alphabet, and has recently gotten interested in the periodic table,\" his mother said. \"His interests are vast and varied, and he is always keen to learn more and loves a challenge.\"",
      "Harris-Birtill's parents \u2014 who both work at Scotland's prestigious University of St. Andrews \u2014 told Guinness World Records they first decided to reach out to Mensa to find more support for Joseph after seeing how early he'd started reading.",
      "\"I searched online for any further support available, and saw that Mensa offers resources and membership for highly able children,\" Rose said. \"We hope that this accomplishment can give him a sense of pride when he is older \u2013 it's a very unusual accolade and the credit is all his!\"",
      "Harris-Birtill is 13 days younger than the youngest female member of Mensa was, American\u00a0Isla McNabb, when she was admitted to the club in 2022. He also has, by default, taken the title of Britain's youngest Mensa member, topping Teddy Hobbs who achieved that rank at the age of four in 2023.",

      "\"It is a common misconception that everything is super easy for gifted children. But everyone needs appropriate stimulation and understanding throughout their lives, and highly able learners can sadly have their unique talents dimmed by the pressure to fit into environments that simply haven't been properly designed for them,\" she told Guinness World Records. \"Joseph is fortunate enough to attend a brilliant nursery and has an excellent music teacher, and in Mensa we hope to provide him with a community of peers as a source of further support as his formidable intellect continues to grow and develop.\"",

      "A controversial new U.S. and Israel-backed aid group says it began operating in the war-torn Gaza Strip on Monday, despite objections from the United Nations, other humanitarian groups, and the recent, sudden resignation of its American executive director, who said it couldn't operate independently. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it opened its first aid distribution hubs in the enclave on Monday and that truckloads of food had been delivered.",
      "The GHF said in a statement that about 8,000 food boxes had been distributed by Tuesday afternoon, each one containing enough to feed \"5.5 people for 3.5 days, totaling 462,000 meals.\"",
      "\"More trucks with aid will be delivered tomorrow, with the flow of aid increasing each day,\" GHF said in a statement.",
      "There were unconfirmed reports by Israeli and Palestinian media outlets that one of the aid hubs was abandoned by the security personnel in charge of securing the operation after thousands of people clambering for food overran the location. The Israel Hayom newspaper said the security forces withdrew to helicopters amid gunfire.",
      "In a statement, the GHF said there was a \"moment in the late afternoon\" at one of its Secure Distribution Sites when the number of people seeking aid \"was such that the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely and dissipate. This was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties. Normal operations have resumed.\"",
      "The group said some Palestinians endured \"several hour delays in accessing the site due to blockades imposed by Hamas.\"",
      "In a separate statement, the Israeli military said troops had \"fired warning shots in the area outside the compound. Control over the situation was established, food distribution operations are expected to continue as planned, and the safety of IDF troops was not compromised.\"",
      "The GHF \u2014 the leadership and funding of which have remained unclear \u2014 was created as Israel and its closest ally, the U.S., faced a growing outcry over Palestinians in Gaza starving amid Israel's nearly three-month blockade of the territory. Under intense pressure from the international community, Israel began letting some food into Gaza last week, but aid organizations have called it a \"drop in the bucket\" given the level of need.",
      "\"As part of the gradual opening of the distribution centers, two of the centers, located in Tel al-Sultan and the Morag Corridor in the Rafah area, began operating today (Tuesday) and are distributing food packages to thousands of families in the Gaza Strip,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. \"The establishment of the distribution centers took place over the last few months, facilitated by the Israeli political echelon and in coordination with the US government. This process coincided with an ongoing dialogue and cooperation with the IDF.\"",
      "The IDF said the new aid system was \"operated by International Aid Organizations, and Secured by an American Civilian Security Company,\" but neither the military nor the GHF itself has named any global non-profit organizations involved in the effort, and it was unclear what security firm from the U.S. was helping secure the hubs.",
      "U.N. calls new aid operation a \"distraction\"",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the United Nations humanitarian office called the work of GHF a \"distraction from what is actually needed,\" which the spokesperson said was the reopening of crossings into Gaza and the end of Israeli restrictions on the kind of aid entering the territory.",
      "The GHF has been tasked by Israel with taking over the handling of aid in Gaza despite objections from the U.N., which, along with other aid groups, has pushed back against the new system. They assert that Israel is trying to use food as a weapon and say a new system won't be effective.",
      "Israel has pushed for an alternative aid delivery plan because it says it must stop Hamas from seizing aid. The U.N. has denied that Hamas has diverted large amounts of aid. Hamas, long designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, also denies the allegations.",
      "The GHF began operations just a day after its executive director, American Jake Wood, announced his resignation and said it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. GHF said it had appointed an interim leader, John Acree, to replace Wood.",
      "The organization, said to be made up of former humanitarian, government and military officials, has said its distribution points will provide aid for a million Palestinians \u2014 around half of Gaza's population \u2014 by the end of the week.",
      "Under pressure from allies, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid into Gaza last week after blocking all food, medicine, fuel or other goods from entering since early March. Aid groups had issued multiple warnings of a looming famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas tells Palestinians not to use new aid system",
      "Hamas warned Palestinians on Monday not to cooperate with the new aid system, saying it is part of Israel's plans to transfer much of Gaza's population to other countries or to force people out of the north into the southern part of Gaza.",
      "Israel says it plans to facilitate what it describes as the voluntary migration of much of Gaza's population of 2 million, a plan rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community.",
      "Israel's military campaign has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and internally displaced some 90% of its population, many people multiple times.",
      "Deadly Israeli strikes in Gaza continue",
      "The desperately needed supplies started flowing into Gaza, according to the GHF, on Monday as Israeli strikes kill at least 52 people in the Palestinian territory.",
      "The airstrikes killed at least 36 people in a school-turned-shelter that was hit as people slept, setting their belongings ablaze, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. The Israeli military   said it targeted militants operating from the school, but CBS News met a young girl who said her mother and all of her sisters were killed in the strike as they slept in the building in the dead of the night.",

    "summary": "King Charles III addressed Canada's Parliament on Tuesday in a rare gesture that comes as Canada grapples with President Trump's tariffs and annexation threats.",
    "story": [
      "King Charles III spoke of a \"critical moment\" for Canada Tuesday as he addressed the Canadian Parliament in a rare gesture that comes as Canada grapples with tariffs and annexation threats by President Trump.",
      "\"The True North is indeed strong and free,\" Charles said, nodding to the Canadian national anthem.",
      "The British monarch, who formally serves as Canada's head of state, arrived in the capital of Ottawa on Monday, part of a two-day visit that's widely viewed as a form of pushback against Mr. Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Why did King Charles speak to Canada's parliament?",
      "The king delivered a \"Speech from the Throne,\" which marked the start of a new session of Parliament after the center-left Liberal Party won last month's federal election. The speech \u2014 written by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's office, not the king \u2014 outlined the new government's agenda and priorities, while acknowledging the political and economic dynamics on the world stage affecting the country.",
      "Marking the start of Parliament with a speech is a longstanding tradition in Canada and other former parts of the British Empire \u2014 but it's highly unusual for the king to deliver the speech himself. Instead, the king's representative in Canada, the governor-general, normally speaks on his behalf. The last time the monarch personally gave the speech was in 1977, when Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0traveled to Canada's capital for the event.",
      "In his address, the king cited his mother's visit to Canada to open its parliament in 1957, saying that the visit came as \"the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory,\" as the Cold War intensified, and \"freedom and democracy were under threat.\" Canada was \"emerging as a growing economic power and a force for peace in the world,\" he added, comparing the moment to the challenges of the present.",
      "\"Today, Canada faces another critical moment,\" Charles said, adding that \"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect.\"",
      "Is King Charles' visit to Ottawa related to Trump?",
      "Some watchers of Canadian politics said so ahead of the visit, especially as Mr. Trump has repeatedly mused about the United States annexing Canada, stirring strong backlash.",
      "Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta, says the royal visit could be \"an indication that the king takes Canada's sovereignty seriously.\"",
      "\"The explicit threats to Canada's sovereignty probably got the attention of the king and his advisers,\" Wesley told CBS News.",
      "The visit could also play to domestic politics, Wesley says. Mr. Trump's comments have \"stirred up patriotism in some odd corners of Canada,\" and the country's status as a constitutional monarchy where the king is still technically the head of state is one major difference between Canada and its neighbor to the south. And even though most Canadians are fairly indifferent toward the monarchy, visits by royals always draw interest.",
      "\"It's seen as a point of pride and distinction between Canada and the U.S.,\" said Wesley, who previously served in several roles for Alberta's provincial government.",
      "University of Toronto political science professor Elizabeth McCallion said the visit is likely intended as a \"reminder that we are an independent country\" and a \"rallying together of Canadians.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Carney told Sky News the invitation to Charles was \"not coincidental.\" In a statement welcoming Charles on Monday, the prime minister didn't mention Mr. Trump, but did hint at Canada's \"distinct identity\" and \"historic ties that crises only fortify.\"",
      "Charles also has a longstanding relationship with Canada, visiting the country over a dozen times before ascending to the throne. Amid a rocky relationship with the United States, many Canadians have looked for signs of support from Charles, taking note of symbolic gestures like the crown's decision to plant a maple tree at Buckingham Palace earlier this year, McCallion said.",
      "McCallion says some Canadians also believe Mr. Trump's longstanding fascination with the British royal family could play to the country's benefit.",
      "\"There's hope that when he's visiting, Trump will take notice and respect the fact that Canada has connections to the British monarchy,\" McCallion told CBS News.",
      "Charles is the head of state for both Canada and the U.K., putting him in an unusual position as the U.K. seeks a stronger trade relationship with the Trump administration. Earlier this month, Carney criticized the U.K. government for inviting Mr. Trump to a state visit earlier this year, presenting Mr. Trump with an invitation from the king. The Canadian leader told Sky News most Canadians \"weren't impressed by that gesture.\"",
      "What did King Charles say in the speech about the U.S. and Trump?",
      "The king alluded to the relationship between Canada and the U.S. throughout his speech, as he addressed changes to the global trade systems. Charles said open global trade, while \"not perfect,\" has \"helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades.\"",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about a drastically changing world around them,\" Charles said. \"Yet this moment is also an incredible opportunity \u2014 an opportunity for renewal. An opportunity to think big and to act bigger. An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War.\"",
      "The king emphasized that a \"confident Canada\" can \"seize this opportunity by recognizing that all Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away.\" He added that by staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians.",
      "The king made only a passing reference to Mr. Trump, saying Canada's prime minister and the U.S. president \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship\" that he said was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "What has Trump said about Canada \u2014 and how has Carney responded?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated annexing Canada in recent months, rattling Canadian politics.",
      "The 51st-state jabs sometimes appear tongue-in-cheek: Mr. Trump referred to Carney's predecessor \u2014 who stepped down as prime minister ahead of new elections this year \u2014 as \"Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada.\" In other cases, Mr. Trump has cast absorbing Canada as a tidy way of resolving the U.S.'s trade deficit with its northern neighbor.",
      "But Trudeau has reportedly called Mr. Trump's talk of absorbing Canada \"a real thing,\" telling business and labor leaders in a private meeting that he sees taking over Canada as a way of getting access to the country's mineral wealth, according to the public broadcaster CBC. Many Canadian voters hold the same view, according to McCallion.",
      "\"I think maybe the first or second time, people were offended but thought he was kidding. And at this point, certainly no Canadians think he's kidding,\" McCallion said. \"Most Canadians are taking it as a serious threat.\"",
      "When asked whether he would use military force to take over Canada, Mr. Trump said earlier this month, \"I don't see it.\" But in a White House meeting with Carney days later, the U.S. leader still called the idea of annexing Canada a \"wonderful marriage\" that would deliver \"tremendous\" benefits to Canada, and referred to the border between the two countries as \"artificial.\"",
      "Carney said in the meeting Canada \"won't be for sale, ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on many Canadian goods, leading Canada to hit the U.S. with retaliatory levies.",
      "Last month's Canadian elections were dominated by Mr. Trump's tariffs and annexation comments, and the race was widely seen as a referendum on who Canadians trusted more to deal with the Trump administration.",
      "Carney's Liberal Party \u2014 which has held power for almost a decade \u2014 previously trailed the Conservatives in polling, but its fortunes rebounded after Mr. Trump's jabs at Canada. In a victory speech, Carney said the country's \"old relationship with the United States \u2026 is over,\" and argued Mr. Trump is \"trying to break us so that America can own us.\"",
      "\"Our national identity is at times muddied because it's made up of so many different cultures that have come together,\" McCallion told CBS News. \"Often, Canadians primarily express their national identity as not being American.\"",

    "summary": "Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh was taken captive after his F-16 fighter jet crashed in northern Syria.",
    "story": [
      "A Swedish man was indicted Tuesday in connection with ISIS' killing of a Jordanian pilot whose plane went down in Syria on Christmas Eve 2014, prosecutors said.",
      "The 26-year-old Jordanian, 1st Lt. Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, was taken captive after his F-16 fighter jet crashed near the extremists' de facto capital of Raqqa in northern Syria. He was forced into a cage that was set on fire, killing him on camera in early 2015.",
      "The suspect was identified by Swedish prosecutors as Osama Krayem, 32, who is alleged to have traveled to Syria in September 2014 to fight for ISIS.",
      "The airman became the first known foreign military pilot to fall into the militants' hands after the U.S.-led international coalition began its aerial campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq in 2014. Jordan, a close U.S. ally, was a member of the coalition and the pilot's killing appeared aimed at pressuring the government of Jordan to leave the alliance.",
      "Krayem was charged with \"participating in the brutal execution of a pilot\" near Raqqa, prosecutor Reena Devgun told a press conference.",
      "Krayem is set to go on trial June 4 in Stockholm. He was previously convicted in France and Brussels for fatal ISIS attacks in those countries.",
      "Video of the killing",
      "In a 20-minute video released in 2015, purportedly showing al-Kaseasbeh's killing, he displayed signs of having been beaten, including a black eye.",
      "In the video, the victim is seen walking past several masked ISIS fighters, including Krayem, according to prosecutors.",
      "The pilot is then locked in a cage that is set on fire, leading to his death, Henrik Olin, the other prosecutor in charge of the case, told reporters.",
      "\"This bestial murder, in which a prisoner was burned alive in a cage, was staged in a carefully produced video that was broadcast around the world. Its publication marked an unprecedented escalation in the Islamic State group's violent propaganda,\" Olin said.",
      "Prosecutors have been unable to determine the exact day of the murder, but the investigation has identified the location where it took place.",
      "The footage was widely released as part of the militant group's propaganda.",
      "The killing sparked outrage and anti-ISIS demonstrations in Jordan, and King Abdullah II ordered two al Qaeda prisoners to be executed in response.",
      "In 2022, Krayem was among 20 men convicted by a special terrorism court in Paris for involvement in a wave of ISIS attacks in the French capital in 2015, targeting the Bataclan theater, Paris caf\u00e9s and the national stadium. The assaults killed 130 people and injured hundreds, some permanently maimed.",
      "Krayem was sentenced to 30 years in prison, for charges including complicity to terrorist murder. French media reported that France agreed in March to turn Krayem over to Sweden for nine months, to assist with the Swedish probe and his expected trial.",
      "Sweden is then to return him to France so he can serve out his sentence, French media reported.",
      "In 2023, a Belgian court sentenced Krayem, among others, to life in prison on charges of terrorist murder in connection with 2016 suicide bombings that killed 32 people and wounded hundreds at Brussels' airport and a busy subway station, the country's deadliest peacetime attack.",
      "Krayem was aboard the commuter train that was hit, but did not detonate the explosives he was carrying.",
      "Both the Paris and Brussels attacks were linked to the same ISIS network.",
      "\"It is painful for my parents to be confronted with this event again, but we are grateful that the Swedish authorities want to give us justice,\" Jawdat al-Kasasbeh, the pilot's brother, told broadcaster Sveriges Radio.",
      "Life in Sweden",
      "Krayem grew up in Rosengard, a district notorious in Sweden for high crime and unemployment rates where more than 80% of the residents are first- or second-generation immigrants.",
      "\"He was well-known to the local police for multiple criminal activities like thefts, for instance,\" Muhammad Khorshid, who ran a program in Rosengard to help immigrants integrate into Swedish society, told The Associated Press in 2016.",
      "He said Krayem \"was the perfect target for radicalization \u2014 no job, no future, no money.\"",
      "Krayem had posted photos on social media from Syria, including one where he posed with an assault rifle in front of the black flag of ISIS.",
      "Lost territory",
      "At its peak, ISIS ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom in Iraq and Syria and was notorious for its brutality \u2014 much of it directed against fellow Sunni Muslims as well as against those the group deemed to be heretics. It beheaded civilians, slaughtered 1,700 captured Iraqi soldiers in a short period, and enslaved and raped thousands of women from the Yazidi community, one of Iraq's oldest religious minorities.",
      "In March 2019, the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the the last sliver of land the extremists controlled in the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz. While ISIS has lost its hold on all of the territory it once controlled, sleeper cells still stage occasional attacks in Iraq and Syria and abroad.",
      "Arrest in Germany",
      "Also on Tuesday, the German federal prosecutor separately announced the arrest of an alleged member of the Syrian secret intelligence services under former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The suspect, who was only named as Fahad A. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested on suspicion of acts of killing, torture and deprivation of liberty as crimes against humanity.",
      "He allegedly took part in more than 100 interrogations between late April 2011 and mid-April 2012. At least 70 prisoners died from the torture and prison conditions, the federal prosecutor's office said.",

    "summary": "Human and animal bones were found inside the 1,500-year-old Bromeswell bucket. A double-sided comb was also discovered.",
    "story": [
      "A 1,500-year-old bucket discovered in England has been identified as an ancient cremation burial vessel, experts said.",
      "The 6th-century bucket was found at Sutton Hoo, an archaeological site near Suffolk, England, that is home to two ancient cemeteries. Fragments of the bucket, named the Bromeswell bucket, were first found in 1986. Researchers found more pieces of the relic last year during an excavation by Time Team, a British TV show where archaeologists conduct excavations on-camera.",
      "An analysis of the newly-discovered pieces determined that Time Team had found the entire base of the bucket, and that it contained human bone fragments, the National Trust, a U.K.-based conservation organization, said in a news release. The bones included part of an ankle bone and fragments of a skull, which the National Trust said was proof of an \"early Anglo-Saxon cremation burial.\"",
      "Angus Wainwright, a National Trust archaeologist, said in the news release that the burial appeared to be \"very special,\" and that researchers will conduct further analysis.",
      "There were also animal bones inside the bucket, which is made of copper alloy and is decorated with a hunting scene. The National Trust said the bones were larger than those of a pig, and noted that horses were often included on funeral pyres as a symbol of status during this time. The bones will undergo radiocarbon dating, the National Trust said.",
      "\"We knew that this bucket would have been a rare and prized possession back in Anglo-Saxon times, but it's always been a mystery why it was buried,\" Wainwright said. \"Now we know it was used to contain the remains of an important person in the Sutton Hoo community.\"",
      "The bucket was made in the Byzantine Empire and may have been a diplomatic gift or acquired by a mercenary Saxon soldier, the National Trust said. The vessel is decorated with a scene of men armed with swords and shields. The scene also includes lions and dogs. The newest fragments help complete the picture, showing feet, paws, the base of shields and the face of one hunting man.",
      "Also inside the bucket was a double-sided comb that the National Trust said was likely made from antler. The agency said its researchers hope ancient DNA can be recovered from the object. The item was not burned in the cremation process, the National Trust noted. The inclusion of such combs in other burial sites suggest that \"personal appearance and grooming was important to the Anglo-Saxons.\" The comb could also have been used to control lice, the trust said.",
      "Plant remains were found during the excavation of the bucket pieces. Analysis of those pieces could \"reveal more about the climate and seasonality around the time the bucket was buried,\" the National Trust said.",
      "Time Team aired a documentary about the discovery and year-long analysis project earlier in May. The group will conduct more research at Sutton Hoo through mid-June.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A 19-year-old New Zealand man has died after taking part in a new tackling game that's trending on social media  in which competitors run at each other and collide while wearing no protective equipment. Police confirmed Ryan Satterthwaite suffered a head injury on Sunday while playing a backyard game with friends in the North Island city of Palmerston North. He died on Monday as a result of his injuries.",
      "Area police commander Inspector Ross Grantham described Satterthwaite's death as \"a huge tragedy\" and urged others to \"consider the significant safety and injury risks\" of the game that is known as RUNIT or RUNIT Straight.",
      "\"A young man lost his life as a result of participating in what I understand to be a social media frenzy,\" Grantham said. \"While this is not a criminal matter, police will continue to undertake inquiries on behalf of the coroner.\"",
      "Grantham said \"the tackle game played by the group of friends was based on a social media-driven trend where participants compete in full-contact collisions without protective gear.",
      "\"While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity.\"",
      "RUNIT is based loosely on the contact elements of rugby union, rugby league or the NFL and involves two competitors, a runner and a tackler, running at each other and colliding on a 65 foot by 13 foot area known as a battlefield.",
      "The game has grown in social media popularity through the Australian RUNIT Championship League, which offers cash prizes to competitors. Organizers promote the event as \"the world's fiercest new collision sport.\"",
      "Two trial events in Auckland in recent weeks saw eight men compete for 20,000 New Zealand dollars ($12,000) in front of more than 1,000 spectators. Winners were expected to go into a championship event next month with prize money of up to 250,000 New Zealand dollars ($150,000).",
      "Two other events in Auckland were canceled when organizers were unable to obtain permits.",
      "The RUNIT Championship League released a statement to the New Zealand news website Stuff on Tuesday, saying it \"does not encourage any copying of the sport as it should only be done under the strict conditions.\"",
      "\"This is tragic news and our hearts go out to the family and friends of Ryan. Any contact sport like boxing, martial arts or combat-style activities should only be held in highly controlled environments which include professional medical supervision and support.\"",
      "RUNIT has been strongly condemned by experts in head injuries who say competitors run a high risk of a serious brain injury.",
      "It is by no means the first social media-fueled trend to draw safety warnings after a tragedy. Medical experts have been forced to warn people, and young people in particular, about the risks of everything from inhaling solvents to abusing over-the-counter medications and even snorting condoms.",

I learned so much and thank you again. I\u2019m really happy it worked out the way it did to. Have a great rest of the shoot and yes talk soon!\"",

      "Following his diagnosis of a brain condition, singer Billy Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts.",
      "The five-time Grammy winner, 76, announced on Friday that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which occurs when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up inside or around the brain.",
      "\"This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,\" the announcement on Joel\u2019s website said.",

      "\"Under his doctor\u2019s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.\"",

      "Billy Joel performs at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 19, 2023, in New York City. Following his diagnosis of a brain condition, Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts. (Getty Images)",
      "\"The fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid, is constantly produced in fluid-filled spaces in the center of the brain called ventricles,\" Matthew Potts, M.D., a Northwestern Medicine neurosurgeon, told Fox News Digital. (He is not involved in Joel's care.)",
      "\"It flows through the ventricles and then around the surface of the brain and spinal cord, where it is then reabsorbed.\"",
      "Hydrocephalus can happen for a variety of reasons, including infection, trauma to the brain or bleeding within the brain, the doctor said.",
      "\"This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"",
      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a version of the condition that is typically seen in older people, where the cerebrospinal fluid builds up without increasing the pressure in the brain.",
      "Despite the fact that pressure remains normal, NPH can impact brain function, particularly the areas of thinking, memory, movement and focus, according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Symptoms of NPH",
      "The three main effects of NPH are gait issues, urinary incontinence and cognitive difficulties. Collectively, these symptoms are known as \"Hakim\u2019s triad.\"",
      "The cognitive problems can include memory loss, slow thinking and difficulty, according to Mia Kazanjian, M.D., a board-certified radiologist in private practice based in Connecticut.",
      "The five-time Grammy winner, 76, announced on Friday that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside or around the brain. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images)",
      "\"This can negatively impact someone\u2019s career and personal life, limiting the ability to do activities of daily living like eating, bathing and dressing,\" Kazanjian told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\"This can also lead to emotional changes, like depression.\"",
      "Urinary incontinence means loss of bladder control, which can cause discomfort, anxiety and embarrassment, according to the doctor.",
      "\"This can predispose someone to bladder infection and skin irritation,\" she cautioned.",
      "MINI-STROKES MAY CAUSE SURPRISING LONG-TERM HEALTH ISSUE, EXPERTS WARN",
      "\"If someone has to get up in the middle of the night due to this, he or she is more likely to fall. Furthermore, it can lead someone to isolate socially, which can lead to feelings of loneliness.\"",
      "Gait impairment means the person\u2019s steps are unsteady, there is loss of balance, and the feet can stick to the ground, shuffle or freeze, Kazanjian said.",
      "\"The danger is that someone can fall and sustain trauma with a significant injury,\" she said.",

      "Other factors, such as race, gender or ethnicity, do not appear to impact the chances of the condition occurring.",
      "Approximately 0.2% of people between 70 and 80 will develop NPH, and it affects around 5.9% of those over 80, the above source stated.",
      "The condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans). (iStock)",
      "Only some 0.003% of people under 65 will get the condition.",

      "Diagnosis and treatment",
      "The condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans).",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"One end is placed into a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid, usually in the ventricle in the brain or a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid in the lumbar spine below the spinal cord,\" Potts told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The other end goes somewhere else in the body that can reabsorb the fluid, usually in the abdomen.\"",
      "The only known risk factor for NPH is age, with the average age of onset around 70.",
      "\"Shunts are more complex than just a tube \u2014 there is often a valve that regulates how much fluid can flow through it.\"",
      "Some newer shunts can be programmed to change the rate of fluid flow from outside the body, Potts added.",

      "Symptoms typically improve within hours or days of the shunt being implanted. The surgery itself usually entails days or weeks of recovery.",

Among them, a large staff that comes with the job, and Air Force Two, which he has repeatedly used to make stops across the U.S. and the globe since the start of the second Trump administration.",
      "And Vance is now finance chair of the Republican National Committee, the first sitting vice president to hold such a position with a national party committee. The posting puts Vance in frequent contact with the GOP's top donors.",
      "But while Trump has hinted that Vance could be his successor and called him \"a fantastic, brilliant guy\" in the \"Meet the Press\" interview, he has avoided anointing his vice president as the party's next nominee.",
      "Vance has taken no steps toward a 2028 presidential run and isn't seriously thinking about it at this time, a source in the vice president's political orbit told Fox News.",
      "\"I really am just not focused on politics,\" Vance said in early April in a \"Fox and Friends\" interview. \"I'm not focused on the midterm elections in 2026, much less the presidential election in 2028.

      "However, the term-limited 46-year-old governor, who has a year and a half left in office steering Florida, proved in the past few years his fundraising prowess and retains plenty of supporters across the country.",
      "DeSantis was also able, to a degree, to repair relations with Trump, helped raise money for the GOP ticket during the general election and earned a prime-time speaking slot at the 2024 Republican convention. And in December 2024, the governor was seen as a possible replacement when now-Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's nomination briefly faltered.",
      "While DeSantis is certain to still harbor national ambitions, his feud this year with the Republican-dominated Florida legislature and the controversy over a charity tied to Florida first lady Casey DeSantis are seen as potential hurdles.",

      "Thanks to his 2021 gubernatorial victory, the first by a Republican in Virginia in a dozen years, Gov. Glenn Youngkin instantly became a GOP rising star.",
      "In Virginia, governors are limited to one four-year term, which means Youngkin has seven months left in office.",
      "The 58-year-old governor, who hails from the Republican Party's business wing but has been able to thrive in a MAGA-dominated party, likely harbors national ambitions.",
      "And Youngkin's trip to Iowa, the state that for a half century has kicked off the GOP's presidential nominating calendar, in July to headline a state party fundraising gala is sparking 2028 speculation.",
      "Asked in late 2024 in a Fox News Digital interview about a White House run, Youngkin pointed to his job as governor, saying, \"I need to finish strong so Virginia can really continue to soar. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to spend my time on.\"",

      "Kemp was heavily recruited by national Republicans to run in 2026 to try and flip a Democrat-controlled Senate seat. And the announcement earlier in May by the 61-year-old governor that he would pass on a 2026 Senate run, fueled buzz that Kemp may instead be mulling a 2028 White House run.",

      "Since the start of Trump's second administration, Cruz has reaffirmed his conservative credentials by voicing opposition to the president's controversial tariffs.",
      "Honorable mentions",
      "Among the others to keep an eye on is Nikki Haley.",
      "The former two-term South Carolina governor, who served as U.N. ambassador in Trump's first term, was the first GOP challenger to jump into the race against the former president in the 2024 nomination race.",
      "Haley outlasted the rest of the field, becoming the final challenger to Trump before ending her White House bid in March 2024.",
      "While the 53-year-old Haley ended up backing Trump in the general election, her earlier clashes with the president during the primaries left their mark. Even though she addressed the GOP faithful at the 2024 convention, her political future in a party dominated by Trump is uncertain.",

      "DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON'T: HERE'S WHY YOU NEED BOTH",
      "Data removal services are real-time and energy savers when it comes to protecting your personal information online. The way these services work is simple. They send hundreds of data removal requests on your behalf to people-search sites you might not even know exist but are still exposing your data. And with some services, the process goes even further than that.",
      "People-search sites aren\u2019t the only places exposing your personal information without your knowledge. In fact, they\u2019re just a small part of the larger\u00a0data broker industry.",
      "There are marketing, health, financial, risk and many other types of data brokers trading your information. Your data is a commodity they use to make a profit, often without you even realizing it.",
      "Data removal services have taken on the challenge of fighting this threat to your privacy. They continuously scour the web, looking for your profiles. This way, you can just sign up and let them handle the work in the background. And here\u2019s the best part: They take about 10 minutes to set up, roughly the same time it takes to opt out of a single people-search site.",

      "Provide the minimal information needed for them to effectively locate your profiles on people-search sites",
      "And that\u2019s it. The removal process is entirely automated and requires little to no effort on your part. With this small initial effort, you may save yourself from privacy-related risks, including scams and even\u00a0identity theft. But what if your data is exposed on a people-search site not covered by any data removal service?",
      "Every removal service out there has limitations on the number of data brokers it supports. It\u2019s not about a lack of effort; it\u2019s mostly because brokers are generally unwilling to cooperate, to put it mildly. But there\u2019s a way to address this issue without going back to manual opt-outs. The top names in the data removal industry now offer custom removals. In simple terms, this means you can ask them to remove your personal information from websites not currently covered by their standard plans.",
      "The catch is that you\u2019ll need to do the research yourself and point out which sites are exposing your data. It\u2019s not as convenient as having everything done automatically, but it\u2019s a relatively minor inconvenience for the sake of your online privacy.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Being mindful of the information you provide to AI tools is the first and most crucial step in protecting your privacy. Don't share sensitive details such as your full name, home address, financial information, passwords or any other personal data that could be used to identify or harm you or others.",
      "Protecting your AI accounts from unauthorized access helps keep your interactions and data safe.

      "Adjusting your social media privacy settings can greatly reduce the amount of personal information available to data brokers.

      "Kurt Knutsson reports World ID's iris scanning tech launches in six U.S. cities to verify identity, fight AI bots.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",
      "While Altman says this technology keeps humans central as AI advances, it also raises serious concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive biometric data, with critics and regulators questioning how this information will be used and protected.",

      "A woman looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",
      "A man looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "10 SIGNS YOUR IDENTITY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED",
      "Aggressive US rollout targets 180M users",
      "World ID is currently available in Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Tennessee, Miami and San Francisco, with plans to expand further. The company aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, targeting 180 million users. While the technology promises enhanced security, the debate over its privacy implications continues to grow.",

      "Privacy concerns halt World ID from being widely adopted",
      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "World ID helps prove that people online are real humans and not AI bots, something that is on the rise. In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms.

They urgently ask for sensitive information, except it's not really them. It's a deepfake, powered by AI, and you're the target of a sophisticated scam. These kinds of attacks are happening right now, and they're getting more convincing every day.",
      "That's the warning sounded by the 2025 AI Security Report, unveiled at the RSA Conference (RSAC), one of the world's biggest gatherings for cybersecurity experts, companies, and law enforcement. The report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.",

      "Illustration of cybersecurity risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI tools are leaking sensitive data",
      "One of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that\u00a01 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks.",
      "This data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later.",
      "Deepfake scams are now real-time and multilingual",
      "AI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds.",
      "Real-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders.",
      "Illustration of a person video conferencing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI is running phishing and scam operations at scale",
      "Social engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim\u2019s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages.",
      "Tools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors.",
      "Another tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim\u2019s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen.",
      "AI is also powering large-scale\u00a0sextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection.",
      "By removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort.",
      "Stolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web",
      "With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.",

      "Phrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenarios",
      "Asking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",
      "Some AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways.",
      "AI-generated malware is entering the mainstream",
      "AI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group called\u00a0FunkSac was identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..",
      "Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called\u00a0Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.",
      "Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware.",

      "A large-scale example came from a Russian propaganda group called Pravda, which published more than 3.6 million fake articles online. These articles were designed to trick AI chatbots into repeating their messages. In tests, researchers found that major AI systems echoed these false claims about 33% of the time.",

      "1) Avoid entering sensitive data into public AI tools:\u00a0Never share passwords, personal details, or confidential business information in any AI chat, even if it seems private. These inputs can sometimes be logged or misused.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software: AI-generated phishing emails and malware can slip past outdated security tools. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords.",
      "4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages: If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.",
      "8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure\u00a0password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "9) Keep your software updated: AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches.\u00a0Regular updates close security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are now using AI to power some of the most convincing and scalable attacks we\u2019ve ever seen. From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it\u2019s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.",

      "Have you ever wished your daily commute could be as easy and comfortable as driving a car, but as fun and eco-friendly as riding a bike? You are not alone. That is exactly the kind of thinking that inspired the Acticycle. This four-wheeled electric vehicle is shaking up city transportation by blending the best parts of both worlds. With the Acticycle, you get the comfort, weather protection, and storage you would expect from a car, but with the agility, efficiency, and low cost of a bike.",

      "Acticycle specs: What you need to know",
      "Let's start with the numbers, since they really set the\u00a0Acticycle apart. The vehicle measures about 93 inches long, 36 inches wide, and 60 inches tall, making it compact enough for bike lanes and city streets, but roomy enough for two adults or one adult and two small children. It weighs just 220 pounds, about one-fifth the weight of a typical electric car, and can carry up to 660 pounds of passengers and cargo.",
      "The Acticycle rides on four 20-inch reinforced wheels with puncture-resistant tires, and it uses hydraulic disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Depending on the model, you can choose from a 250-watt, 750-watt, or dual 2000-watt motor setup. Top speeds range from 16 miles per hour with the 250-watt motor to 28 miles per hour with the more powerful versions. The removable lithium-ion batteries provide a range of up to 62 miles per charge, and you can double that by adding a second battery. The Acticycle also features a total of 6 cubic feet of cargo space, divided between a secure hard trunk and a flexible soft compartment, so you can haul groceries, gear, or whatever your day demands.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "TURN ANY BIKE INTO AN E-BIKE IN SECONDS WITH THIS NIFTY GADGET",
      "A new kind of urban mobility",
      "The Acticycle is not just about impressive specs, though. It is about reimagining how we move through our cities. Unlike most bikes, the Acticycle is built for companionship and comfort. The two ergonomic seats are designed to make even long rides enjoyable, so you and a friend can chat and relax on your way to work or out on the town. The seating is plush and supportive, which means you can say goodbye to the aches and pains that come with traditional cycling.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "READY TO UNLEASH YOUR INNER MAVERICK WITH THE THRILLING AIRWOLF HOVERBIKE",
      "Designed for all-weather comfort",
      "One of the most frustrating things about biking in the city is dealing with the weather. The Acticycle takes care of that with a full canopy, roof, and windshield that keep you dry and protected from rain and splashes. Mudguards help keep the mess off your clothes, so you can show up at your destination looking as fresh as when you left home. This weather protection means you do not have to worry about rain gear or last-minute wardrobe changes, making the Acticycle a true year-round solution.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "A PEDAL-ELECTRIC HYBRID THAT'S HALF BIKE, HALF CAR",
      "Agility without compromise",
      "Despite its four wheels, the Acticycle is surprisingly agile. Its tight steering angle and low center of gravity let you weave through traffic, navigate narrow bike lanes, and handle sharp corners with ease. Even when you are carrying a full load of passengers or cargo, the Acticycle maintains stable and responsive handling, so you always feel in control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Power and range",
      "Range anxiety is a thing of the past with the Acticycle. The removable batteries can be charged at home with a standard outlet, and swapping them out is quick and simple. With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat. This kind of performance is usually reserved for much heavier and more expensive electric vehicles, but the Acticycle brings it to a whole new category.",

      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "How much storage does this thing have",
      "City living often means making tough choices about what you can carry with you. The Acticycle makes that a non-issue. With about 6 cubic feet of storage, split between a lockable hard trunk and a roomy soft compartment, you can carry everything from groceries and work supplies to picnic gear and gym bags. The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Eco-friendly and budget-smart",
      "The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet. Its lightweight frame and efficient battery system mean it uses far less energy than a car, and its maintenance needs are similar to a cargo bike rather than a car. You will save money on fuel, parking, insurance, and repairs, all while reducing your environmental impact. It is a win-win for anyone looking to make smarter choices in the city.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "What does the Acticycle cost?",
      "When it comes to price, the Acticycle is designed to be a smart investment for urban commuters who want all the benefits of a car and a bike, but without the hefty price tag. While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",

      "We stay on top of updates for our phones and laptops. Some of us even make sure our smartwatches and security cameras are running the latest firmware. But routers often get overlooked. If it's working, we assume it's fine, but that mindset can be risky.",
      "Now, the FBI has issued a warning that cybercriminals are actively exploiting old, unpatched and outdated routers. The alert, released in May 2025, explains how aging network devices with known flaws are being hijacked by malware and used to power anonymous cybercrime operations. A forgotten device in your home can silently become a tool for attackers.",

      "Devices manufactured around 2010 or earlier are especially vulnerable, as vendors have long ceased providing firmware updates for them. According to the FBI, such end-of-life routers have been breached by cyber actors using a variant of the \"TheMoon\" malware, allowing attackers to install proxy services on the devices and conduct illicit activities anonymously.",
      "In essence, home and small-office routers are being quietly conscripted into proxy networks that mask the perpetrators' identities online. The alert notes that through networks like \"Anyproxy,\" criminals have been selling access to the infected routers as proxy nodes. In these schemes, paying customers can route their internet traffic through unwitting victims' routers, obscuring their own location while the victim's device (and IP address) bears the blame.",

      "WHAT EXACTLY IS A DATA BREACH? WHY SHOULD I CARE?",
      "How hackers exploit these routers",
      "Many recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers.",
      "One prominent threat is\u00a0TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground.",
      "For users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address. For businesses, the risk is even higher: Outdated routers can be exploited for deeper network intrusions, data theft and ransomware attacks. In critical sectors, the consequences can be severe, affecting safety and compliance.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from router hackers",
      "Given the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay.",
      "1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported:\u00a0If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand.",
      "If you're not sure which router to get, check out my list of\u00a0top routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility with\u00a0VPN services.",
      "2) Keep your router's firmware updated:\u00a0Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier.",
      "3) Turn off remote access:\u00a0Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is\u00a0disabled, then save the changes and restart your router.",
      "4) Use a strong password for your router settings:\u00a0Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like\u00a0T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly:\u00a0If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help.",
      "6) Reporting to authorities:\u00a0The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to the\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This isn't just about asking everyone to upgrade their old gear. It's about the bigger issue of who's actually responsible when outdated devices turn into security risks. Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets. The real challenge isn't just technical. It's about how manufacturers, service providers and users all handle the long tail of aging tech that still lives on in the real world.",

      "What really sets LEVA apart is its ability to load and unload cargo boxes without any human help. It spots a standard cargo box, moves right over it, lowers itself by bending its legs and then locks onto the box using powered hooks underneath its body. After securing the box, LEVA lifts itself back up and carries the load to its destination. It can handle boxes weighing up to 187 pounds, which is pretty impressive for a robot of its size.",

      "A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch.",
      "Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they\u2019ve become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well).",
      "Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it\u2019s still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us:",
      "\"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?\"",
      "I get what you\u2019re saying, Frank. You\u2019d think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn\u2019t be bypassed. But you\u2019d be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they\u2019re not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.",

      "A smartphone on a table\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 ways bad actors can bypass fingerprint scanners",
      "There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods.",
      "Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at\u00a0NYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.",
      "Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you\u2019ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,\u00a0researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.",
      "On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn\u2019t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn\u2019t work on them.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",
      "Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone\u2019s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work.",
      "PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.",
      "Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.",

      "So, can you trust fingerprint scanners?",
      "Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don\u2019t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.",
      "Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.",

      "Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures.",
      "1. Choose trusted phone brands:\u00a0If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "2. Keep your phone updated:\u00a0Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage.\u00a0Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "4. Don\u2019t rely only on your fingerprint:\u00a0Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.",
      "5. Be careful about who handles your phone:\u00a0If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.",
      "6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:\u00a0Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It\u2019s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it\u2019s better to skip it and use your password instead.",
      "7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they\u2019re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don\u2019t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn\u2019t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.",

    "summary": "Massive password leak reveals cybersecurity flaws. Learn how to protect your accounts with strong passwords, two-factor authentication and data removal services.",
    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Passwords are outdated, and it's time for both tech companies and users to move on. There, I said it. Like it or not, the weakest link in cybersecurity is anything that relies on human input. While organizations continue to invest in firewalls and endpoint security, the most persistent vulnerability remains the human password.",
      "The internet has long struggled with poor password practices, but a recent discovery highlights just how serious the problem is.",
      "Security researchers have uncovered more than 19 billion newly leaked passwords, collected from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025. An astonishing 94% of these passwords were either reused, predictable or both.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Between April 2024 and April 2025, data from nearly 200 separate cybersecurity incidents became publicly available, as discovered by\u00a0Cybernews. These were not isolated events. They involved massive leak repositories including combolists, stealer logs and compromised databases. In total, over 3 terabytes of raw leaked data were analyzed, comprising more than 19 billion passwords. Only 6 percent of these, just over 1.1 billion, were unique.",
      "Among the most used passwords, \"123456\" appeared in over 338 million instances. Words like \"Password\" and \"admin\" followed close behind, despite years of public warnings. Such defaults often originate from devices like routers or enterprise tools, where they are rarely changed and frequently reused elsewhere.",
      "1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK",
      "Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities.",
      "Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "The bigger problem",
      "According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely on\u00a0two-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all.",
      "Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms.",

      "A password manager is the solution",
      "Reused or weak passwords pose a massive threat, not just to individuals but to organizations. A single compromised password can trigger a domino effect, exposing multiple accounts across services. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.

      "Four ways to stay safe from password-stealing scammers",
      "Protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are four effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your password is stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:\u00a0Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "4. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "When it comes down to it, passwords just aren't cutting it anymore. The sheer number of leaked passwords and the fact that so few are unique show how vulnerable we really are. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster, but we don't have to make it easy for them. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping our software updated and considering extra privacy tools, we can take back some control over this situation. It might take a little effort to change old habits, but the peace of mind you get is worth it.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the \"Decoding Broken Hearts\" initiative on \"Special Report.\"",
      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How AI surveillance will work in the New York City Subway",
      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system. While details about the AI providers and full deployment timelines have not been shared, the MTA emphasizes that facial recognition technology will not be part of this system. This is intended to protect rider privacy.",

To bolster safety, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed 1,000 National Guard members to support transit police efforts.

      "Is AI being used in public transit elsewhere?",

We do not yet know exactly which behaviors the system will flag or how effective it will be in practice. Perhaps more importantly, privacy advocates and civil liberties groups warn about potential biases in AI systems and the risk of false positives that could unfairly target certain groups.",
      "The MTA's decision to exclude facial recognition is a positive step, but ongoing transparency and oversight will be crucial. Michael Kemper's extensive experience leading the NYPD's Transit Bureau, where he helped reduce subway crime, adds credibility to the initiative. Still, as this technology rolls out, balancing safety with privacy and fairness will be key to earning public trust.",

      "1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

      "\"First of all, that jail had been deemed a train wreck in terms of just basic jail operations,\" Cameron Lindsay told Fox News Digital.",
      "Lindsay worked for 20 years in the federal prison system, seven of them as a warden. He was once the warden of the infamous Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He also served as a warden at two private prisons. Now, he is a consultant and expert witness.",
      "\"It would appear that basic security inspections were not taking place at the jail. Inmates should never be able to tear a toilet off of a wall and just be able to go right to the perimeter fence,\" he said. \"I mean, I just can't believe that.\"",

      "DEMOCRAT LAWMAKERS DEMAND LOUISIANA SHERIFF RESIGN AFTER 10 INMATES ESCAPE JAIL",
      "In 2013, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office (OPSO), which runs the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility, entered into a consent decree with the Department of Justice to keep the jail operational. The decree stemmed from civil rights abuses, and OPSO agreed to federal government oversight and biannual compliance checks.",
      "The latest of those compliance check reports shows that the jail was fully compliant with 42% of the decree's measures and completely noncompliant with at least 5% of them. It is partially compliant with about 53% of the measures.",
      "The report, released in October 2024, paints a picture of completely inadequate inmate supervision, leading to violence and the use of illicit drugs, shakedown and extortion schemes, and inmates having limitless time to fashion weapons out of everyday jail items.",
      "Sheriff Susan Hutson speaks at City Hall in New Orleans on May 20, 2025. (Sophia Germer/Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP)",

      "\"The inmates appear to be emboldened in their refusal to follow the rules and obey the orders of the security staff,\" the report said. \"Very concerning is that both staff and inmates continue to relay to the Monitors that there are inmates who are acting as \u2018tank bosses\u2019 and are extorting other inmates and requiring payment for protection.\"",
      "Law enforcement searches for a fugitive in New Orleans on May 21, 2025. (Chris Granger/Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP)",
      "There was also no jail monitoring system to verify that security checks were taking place and being reported at regular intervals.",
      "Those failures have come into focus since the early morning hours of May 17, when 10 inmates broke out of the jail and ran amok in the New Orleans area.",
      "As of Friday afternoon, five of them remained at large.",

      "One of the 10 escapees was Antoine Massey, who was being held in the jail on charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation, theft of a motor vehicle and a parole violation. He was also wanted for rape and kidnapping in St. Tammany Parish, according to Fox 8.",
      "Massey had escaped from custody three times since 2007 and was no longer eligible to be released with an electronic ankle monitor because he kept cutting them off.",

      "\"He would be housed in the most secure location within the jail,\" he said. \"All staff would be apprised of this individual, and given his incredibly high risk for escape, I would require documented frequent checks at least once every 30 minutes on an irregular schedule.\"",

      "\"And I tell you what, here's another thing that speaks to me about the ineffectiveness of this facility,\" he said. \"I would tell you that they don't know the first thing about emergency preparedness, because when you have an escape, there should be an immediate response. There should be no delay whatsoever. That information should go out to law enforcement and through the community.\"",

      "JOHANNESBURG \u2013 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa hit back Tuesday against President Donald Trump's demand\u00a0that opposition politician Julius Malema should be arrested, for repeatedly chanting \"kill the farmer.\"",
      "Also on Tuesday, a senior politician within South Africa\u2019s government told Fox News Digital the chant \"inflamed hatred\" and called for \"legal consequences.\"",
      "In the White House Oval Office last week, President Trump had a video showing Malema making the chant shown to the then-visiting Ramaphosa. Trump told the South African leader that Malema should be arrested.",
      "On Sunday, Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) political party, which drew just under 10% of the vote in last May\u2019s South African election and is not part of the government of national unity, told a crowd of thousands at a rally in South Africa\u2019s Free State, \"I\u00a0will never be intimidated by Donald Trump.\"",

      "Just four days after the president\u2019s call that he should be arrested, Malema launched into the chant again, shouting to cheers \"Shoot to kill. Kill the Boer (Afrikaans farmer), the farmer.\" The Afrikaners are descendants of mostly Dutch settlers who first arrived in South Africa in 1652.",
      "Appearing to want to emphasize defiance, Malema then chanted \"I repeat, kill the Boer, the farmer.\"",
      "Reacting to President Trump calling for Malema\u2019s arrest, President Ramaphosa on Tuesday told reporters there are no plans to detain the EFF leader.\u00a0\"It's not a matter where we need to be instructed by anyone (to) go and arrest this one. (Malema) We are a very proud sovereign country that has its own laws, that has its own processes.\"",
      "Ramaphosa continued that South Africa\u2019s equivalent of the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, had decided in 2022 the slogan \"kill the Boer, kill the farmer\" was only a decades-old \"liberation chant and slogan, and it's not meant to be a message that elicits or calls upon anyone to go and be killed, and that is what our court decided.\" Critics point out that Malema sits on South Africa\u2019s Judicial Services Commission \u2013 the body that appoints judges here.",

      "All of this is against the background of President Trump accusing South Africa of genocide against farmers and inviting so far 49 Whites to fly to the U.S. as refugees.",
      "\"That chant has no place in a democratic South Africa,\" the Democratic Alliance (DA) party\u2019s Ian Cameron told Fox News Digital. The DA is South Africa\u2019s main opposition party. They are members of the government of national unity, with Cameron serving as chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police.",
      "Cameron said that Malema singing the chant again this past weekend was \"continuing to divide society and inflame hatred and mistrust. (It) plays a specific role in why farm attacks in South Africa are so unique: while brutal attacks continue in rural areas, he sings that song with pride, and many of his supporters openly celebrate the violence on social media.\"",

      "\"I do believe that Julius Malema\u2019s repeated incitement\u2014especially through songs like \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019, crosses a dangerous and unacceptable line,\" Cameron continued. \"Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of democracy, but it cannot be used as a shield for promoting violence. At the very least, there should be legal consequences for incitement of violence, and our justice system must act without fear or favor.\"",
      "Ramaphosa said\u00a0he was not going to have people arrested \"willy nilly,\"\u00a0adding on Tuesday,\u00a0\"we are a country where freedom of expression is the bedrock of our constitutional arrangement.\"",

I\u2019ve walked into scenes that resembled abattoirs. I remember one farm where the victim\u2019s fingernail marks were still embedded in the carpet from where he was dragged and tortured. These are not ordinary crimes and often include disproportionate violence.\"",

      "According to local media outlets, the ministry on Tuesday said it was a \"typical product of \u2018America first\u2019, the height of self-righteousness, arrogance, high-handed and arbitrary practice.\"",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Levy said that it is crucial that Hamas not remain in power \u2014 and that it is also vital to save the hostages languishing in tunnels under Gaza.",
      "\"If this war ends with the Hamas regime that perpetrated October 7th still in power, it won't end, it will just pause, and the next war will be a matter of time,\" Levy said. \"Israelis don\u2019t want war.

      "Israel has faced international criticism over its handling of the war in Gaza, with the U.K., France and Canada releasing a joint statement earlier this month demanding that Jerusalem end its military operations in the Gaza Strip. The U.K. also suspended trade talks with Israel because of London\u2019s objections to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of being \"on the wrong side of humanity.\"",
      "\"I think anyone criticizing Israel needs to come up with a better plan for how you remove Hamas from power, because otherwise they're just giving it political power and trying to save [it] from the war that it started,\" Levy told Fox News Digital.",
      "The international community has been pressuring Israel regarding hostage swaps. Jerusalem has been pressured to free Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of hostages taken on Oct. 7. Levy acknowledged that while Israel cannot leave the hostages behind, there are valid concerns about these releases.",

      "\"Here's the absurdity of international pressure on Israel to pay a ransom. Most countries don't pay ransoms to terrorist hostage takers because they understand it only incentivizes more hostage taking, it rewards it, it encourages more of it,\" Levy told Fox News Digital. \"Israel has paid a ransom to get hostages out in two cease-fires because we say we know the dangers, we know it's risky, but we've got to get out these poor people who are being starved and tortured and even executed in the dungeons.\"",
      "Levy believes Israel \"found itself stymied along the way\" as countries that initially backed efforts to defeat Hamas \"got cold feet very quickly\" as they understood what removing the terror group from power would entail.",
      "Looking at the broader picture, Levy wonders if Israel had taken on a different strategy from day one, whether the war would have ended sooner, though he admits it would have meant \"defying international pressure.\"",

      "\"I do wonder if that had been the strategy from the beginning\u2014defying international pressure\u2014then it's possible the war might have ended sooner,\" Levy said. \"But again, Israel is caught in this impossible bind because there are still hostages who are trapped in Gaza, whom Hamas is threatening to execute if the Israeli army gets anywhere near them to try to rescue them.\"",
      "This is not a new or empty threat. Several former hostages reported being threatened and said they were told that their captors would execute them if Israeli forces got close. Six other former hostages, including American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, met this fate when they were fatally shot just before the IDF could reach them.",

While the Biden administration put more pressure on Netanyahu, Trump appears to support Israel doing what it must to end the war.",
      "Levy told Fox News Digital that \"Israelis definitely got the impression that the Trump administration has Israel's back and is willing to endorse any military strategy that it wants to implement, but there are also signs the Trump administration, you know, may want to wrap this up very quickly.\"",

But if your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with,\" Vance added.",

      "Trump also emphasized that the new Syrian government needs to suppress the rise of Islamic extremist groups, which Ben Taleblu pointed out is going to be one of the nation\u2019s chief vulnerabilities as it looks to completely re-establish itself in the world order as trade, business and diplomacy have been reopened to Damascus.",

      "A federal judge has denied a legal attempt, for now, to prevent the U.S. government from transferring death row inmates whose sentences were commuted by then-President Joe Biden to the \"Supermax\" in Colorado, the highest-security federal prison in the country.",
      "U.S. District\u00a0Judge Timothy Kelly in Washington, D.C., ruled Tuesday against issuing a preliminary injunction requested in a lawsuit brought by 21 of the 37 former death row inmates, all of whom saw their sentences changed to life without parole in December.",
      "\"The Court cannot grant that relief \u2014 at least not now,\" Kelly wrote in his opinion, saying that the plaintiffs must first exhaust their administrative appeals within the federal Bureau of Prison's transfer process.",
      "The decision comes as the BOP has said it would not transfer any of the plaintiffs to the \"Supermax,\" also known as the Administrative Maximum Facility, or ADX, until at least the end of May.",
      "\"The Bureau of Prisons offers an administrative process for challenging final designations to ADX, and Plaintiffs have not completed \u2014 or, to the Court's knowledge, even started \u2014 that process,\" Kelly wrote. \"Because the Court lacks discretion to append exceptions to Congress's exhaustion requirement, it will deny Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\"",
      "Nearly all of the former federal death row prisoners remain at the penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana, home to the U.S. government's death chamber. The Biden administration halted federal executions, a departure from President Donald Trump's first term, when 13 federal inmates were put to death in a spree of executions not seen since President Grover Cleveland\u00a0in the late 1800s.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about the judge's ruling.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which is among the legal teams representing the plaintiffs, said it still believes that the inmates \"can be safely housed elsewhere in the federal system,\" and that the BOP agreed with that before the Trump administration's Justice Department stepped in.",
      "\"While the court ruled that it could not order the Bureau of Prisons to leave the plaintiffs in place while they appealed their designations to ADX, the fight is far from over,\" Brian Stull, deputy director of the ACLU's Capital Punishment Project, said in a statement.",
      "Trump was critical of Biden's commutation effort, and on his first day back in office in January, he signed an executive order calling for the U.S. attorney general\u00a0to ensure the commuted death row inmates \"are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.\" He also restored the federal death penalty.",
      "The \"Supermax,\" which sits in a mile-high desert south of Colorado Springs, is also known as \"the Alcatraz of the Rockies\" for its isolated conditions and housing some of the most high-profile prisoners deemed safety risks. They currently include drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n and domestic terrorists Eric Rudolph, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber, whose federal death sentence was not commuted by Biden.",
      "The former death row inmates challenging the government's plan to transfer them to the \"Supermax\" said in their complaint, filed in April in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, that doing so would be unconstitutional.",
      "Their legal teams said the condemned inmates were given interviews in early April to assess whether they should be moved to the \"Supermax.\" But the complaint alleges the hearings were a \"sham\" because the BOP had already designated some of them under a \"security threat\" classification that assumes they are promoting violence or terrorist activity in gangs, and can't be safely housed in the general population.",
      "The plaintiffs attempted to show proof that they are not threats, including how despite being on death row they had successful programming and clean disciplinary records, were getting their health care needs met and would be harmed if they were \"subjected to extreme isolation at ADX,\" according to the complaint.",
      "\"Unsurprisingly, following each Plaintiff's hearing, and in some cases within minutes or hours, the Hearing Administrator recommended that ADX placement was 'warranted' for every one of them,\" the complaint says.",
      "\"By categorically condemning Plaintiffs to indefinite incarceration in harsh conditions in response to their receipt of clemency from the previous President, it exceeds the statutory authority granted to the Attorney General and her deputy, and is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion,\" the suit adds.",
      "The federal government said in its response to the complaint that the BOP has the statutory authority to designate where inmates can be held, the inmates went through a multilayered hearing process and have had the right to appeal, and \"Supermax\" inmates are not entirely isolated.",
      "According to the Justice Department attorneys, the prison participates in a federal law known as the First Step Act, which \"provides quarterly incentives to reward inmates for completing certain programming,\" and may be offered \"Starbucks coffee, pizza, and candy that is not available at Commissary.\"",
      "And unlike at the special confinement unit in Terre Haute, \"inmates in the ADX may have the opportunity to 'step down' through a progression of housing with fewer restrictions and additional freedoms to the point where they may be transferred out of the ADX entirely to a high-security institution,\" the government's response said.",
      "Kelly concluded in his ruling that the BOP would, in this case, continue to follow what it has done historically by not transferring inmates to the \"Supermax\" until remedies for appeal are worn out.",
      "\"Of course, if Defendants do transfer any Plaintiffs to ADX before those appeals conclude, or truncate those appeals in an unusual way, such a departure from the BOP's ordinary practice would support Plaintiffs' argument that the designation process at issue here is hardly business as usual for the Bureau,\" Kelly said. \"And it would raise serious questions about who is calling the shots: BOP or someone outside that agency.\""

The New York City-based legacy retailer is more than a year into a three-year effort to become a smaller, but healthier business. It\u2019s shuttering weaker stores and investing in stronger parts of the company, including luxury department store Bloomingdale\u2019s and beauty chain Bluemercury. It has also tried to improve the customer experience, including by speeding up online deliveries and adding staff to stores.",
      "Spring told analysts on the earnings call that the tariff impact on Macy\u2019s outlook includes the additional costs of inventory previously imported under the 145% China tariffs, which have since dropped to 30%. He said the outlook does not include a potential increase in tariffs on the European Union or any other U.S. trading partner.",
      "Trump recently threatened to implement, and then delayed, a 50% tariff on the EU.",

It has expanded that initiative to 75 additional stores, bringing the total to 125 locations that have gotten increased attention. That\u2019s a little over a third of the 350 namesake locations that Macy\u2019s plans to keep open.",
      "Those 125 locations performed better than the overall Macy\u2019s brand. Comparable sales among those revamped stores owned and licensed by Macy\u2019s were down 0.8% compared with the year-ago period.",
      "On Macy\u2019s earnings call in March \u2014 before Trump made several sudden tariff moves that baffled companies and investors \u2014 Spring said the company\u2019s guidance \u201cassumes a certain level of uncertainty\u201d about the economic outlook.

    "story": [
      "PLANO, Texas \u2014 Twenty-five years after introducing many Americans to hybrid vehicles with the Prius, Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs.",
      "Such vehicles can function as an all-electric vehicle for a certain number of miles before they need a traditional gas-powered engine. Unlike traditional hybrids like the Prius that use a small amount of battery technologies, PHEVs also need to be charged with a plug, like an EV, to use the electric range.",
      "PHEVs aren\u2019t new. Toyota first introduced the Prius as a PHEV in the U.S. in 2016, but such plug-ins are experiencing a renaissance as automakers try to meet federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations. They\u2019ve also acted as potential steppingstones to all-electric vehicles for consumers who might be hesitant to go fully electric.",
      "\u201cWe are going to grow our PHEV volume through the lineup over the next few years,\u201d David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, told CNBC during a visit to the company\u2019s North American headquarters. \u201cWe love the PHEV powertrain. We\u2019re working to increase, perpetually increase, the amount of miles you can drive on EV-only range.\u201d",
      "Company sources said Toyota plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. However, they said that could change based on regulations, customer acceptance of electrified technologies and affordability, among other factors.",
      "That percentage of sales would match the amount of PHEV mix allowed under the California Air Resources Board\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero emissions vehicles in the state by 2035. President Donald Trump is expected to eliminate that rule.",
      "Toyota\u2019s planned PHEV expansion comes amid the regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, which the company also continues to invest billions of dollars in annually. The performance of PHEVs also continues to improve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at plug-ins across the lineup, and it\u2019s more a function of where can we build them, and what is the product strength versus the competition,\u201d Christ said.",
      "The EV-only range of PHEVs has increased from a few dozen miles in ideal conditions to 50 miles for vehicles such as the automaker\u2019s redesigned RAV4 that was introduced last week.",
      "Sales estimates and forecasts for PHEVs vary, as their sales are limited and not all companies break out such models when reporting results. Several automotive data and forecasting companies expect modest PHEV growth, to between 4% and 5% of U.S. industry sales by 2030.",
      "\u201cThe growth is likely limited due to the expensive dual powertrain cost structure. For those already invested, it may make sense to continue along the path,\u201d said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \u201cHowever, for those who haven\u2019t already made significant investments, it is a large incremental cost that must be balanced.\u201d",
      "S&P has PHEV sales in the U.S. growing from about 2% last year to 5% by the end of the decade. AutoPacific expects PHEVs to grow to about 4.2% by 2030, while AutoForecast Solutions expects such sales to be relatively stable around 3.3% over the coming years.",
      "PHEV sales for Toyota, including its luxury Lexus brand, increased roughly 39% last year, according to company data. That included a 30% increase for the Toyota brand\u2019s Prius and RAV4 PHEVs, as well as an 88.6% jump for Lexus\u2019 three PHEVs, including a new \u201cTX\u201d model.",
      "That compares to the automaker\u2019s more than 20 hybrid models that experienced a combined sales increase of 53% last year, including a 56% increase for the Toyota brand amid several new introductions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking across the lineup and saying, \u2018How many power trains can we offer on what products?\u2019\u201d Christ said. \u201cWe are going to increase the percentage of hybrids and PHEVs.\u201d",
      "Christ said the Toyota brand expects hybrids, including PHEVs, to account for more than 50% of U.S. sales this year, increasing from roughly 46% in 2024 and nearly 30% in 2023.",
      "Cooper Ericksen, Toyota North America senior vice president of product and battery electric vehicles, or BEVs, compared the automaker\u2019s \u201celectrified\u201d vehicle approach to having the bases loaded in a baseball game with different players.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got ICE. We\u2019ve got hybrid. We got plug-in hybrid. We got EV,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, our chances of being successful in scoring runs is just a lot better than if you\u2019re really overly committed to any one of those power trains.\u201d",
      "Ericksen, citing Toyota research and studies, said once people understand how PHEVs work and their benefits, there\u2019s a massive swing in customer interest from traditional vehicles, hybrids and even some EVs.",
      "\u201cOnce we educate people, by far the biggest swing from all the powertrains is PHEV. It goes up exponentially,\u201d he told CNBC during a separate interview. \u201cPHEV is really important for us. There are people that will consider a PHEV that will not consider a BEV.\u201d",
      "Consumer understanding of PHEVs has been a challenge in the past. It was partially to blame for the slow sales and discontinuation of General Motors\u2019 Chevrolet Volt, which the automaker produced from 2010 to early 2019.",
      "Many consumers also have voiced concern about having to plug the vehicle in. (But the vehicles can still operate as a traditional gas-powered vehicle without ever being plugged in, which has drawn criticism from some EV supporters.)",
      "PHEVs are also costly due to the need for both EV technologies and an engine. Toyota\u2019s PHEVs currently cost thousands of dollars more than traditional or hybrid vehicles.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of negatives in the production side of it, and buyers, unless they\u2019re forced to, don\u2019t really opt for the PHEV models,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, AutoForecast Solutions vice president of global vehicle forecasting.",
      "Toyota\u2019s 2025 RAV4 PHEV carries a roughly $15,000 price premium over the base model and $12,000 over the hybrid version.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like getting two cars in one,\u201d Ericksen said. \u201cAnd if it serves a compliance benefit, maybe we sweeten the pot a little bit on the price to get more people to consider it.\u201d",

      "The California Interscholastic Federation said it was extending access for more \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes to participate in the championship meet. The group announced the change Tuesday after President Donald Trump posted on his social media site about the participation of a trans athlete in the competition.",
      "\u201cUnder this pilot entry process, any biological female student-athlete who would have earned the next qualifying mark for one of their Section\u2019s automatic qualifying entries in the CIF State meet, and did not achieve the CIF State at-large mark in the finals at their Section meet, was extended an opportunity to participate in the 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships,\u201d the federation said in a statement. \u201cThe CIF believes this pilot entry process achieves the participation opportunities we seek to afford our student-athletes.\u201d",
      "The move comes amid a nationwide battle over the rights of transgender youth in which states have limited transgender girls from participating on girls sports teams, barred gender-affirming surgeries for minors and required parents to be notified if a child changes their pronouns at school.

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Elon Musk broke with President Donald Trump on the House-passed domestic policy bill, saying in an interview that he was \"disappointed\" that it would increase the federal deficit.",
      "\"I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" in an interview that will air in full this Sunday.",
      "Musk's public break comes as the Republicans' bill heads to the Senate, where several senators have also criticized the legislation for increasing the deficit. The legislative package encompasses many of Trump's priorities, and the president has urged Congress to send the bill to his desk for a signature \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "The tech mogul's remarks in the interview also come as he has suggested he would be backing away from his administration role to return his attention to the private sector. Musk said in a post on  X last week that he had to be \"super focused\" on his companies and was \"back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms.\"",
      "Musk, a Trump ally and top White House figure, has also  distanced himself from the president on his tariff policies. Musk, whose automaker Tesla has parts made in North America, China and Europe, has called for a \u201czero-tariff situation\u201d between Europe and the U.S., and positioned himself as an advocate of \u201cfree trade and lower tariffs.\u201d",
      "In the \"Sunday Morning\" interview, Musk threw cold water on the title of the bill, which is officially called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, after Trump's description of it.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, I don't know if it can be both,\" Musk said, laughing. \"My personal opinion.\"",
      "A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., shared the clip of Musk's comments on X, saying that Musk \"is right.\" He pointed to the bill's impact on increasing the deficit, adding, \"there's nothing beautiful about that.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., referred to DOGE's efforts in a post to X, praising Musk and DOGE as having done \"INCREDIBLE work exposing waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal government.\"",
      "\"The House made sure to build on DOGE\u2019s success within the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" Johnson said in the post.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency initiative, spearheaded by Musk, has slashed the size of the federal workforce, cut government programs and nixed contracts with the expressed goal of saving federal money. But DOGE efforts have led to a flurry of lawsuits, and critics argue the cuts and layoffs have hurt vital programs and instigated chaos.",
      "At the same time, the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the tax cuts and spending in the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years, which is a sticking point for conservative fiscal hawks.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Sunday likened outsize spending to \"mortgaging our children's future,\" saying in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that he believed there were \"enough\" Republicans to \"stop the process\" in order to make changes to the bill.",
      "Paul said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he would have voted for the bill even if the spending cuts were \"wimpy and anemic\" except for the fact that the legislation would \"explode the debt.\"",
      "GOP senators will also have to contend with a faction of their caucus that has expressed concerns over certain cuts to programs like Medicaid. The House-passed bill is expected to rescind health care for about 8.6 million people, according to the Congressional Budget Office, though the House speaker has argued that the cuts were \"working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., urged his colleagues in an op-ed in The New York Times this month to avoid Medicaid cuts.",
      "\"If Republicans want to be a working-class party \u2014 if we want to be a majority party \u2014 we must ignore calls to cut Medicaid and start delivering on America\u2019s promise for America\u2019s working people,\" Hawley wrote in the op-ed, which was published before the House passed the bill.",
      "Any changes made to the bill in the Senate would also have to be passed by the House. The bill passed the House on a razor-thin margin of 215-214 votes, largely along party lines."

    "summary": "A federal judge has denied a legal attempt, for now, to prevent the U.S. government from transferring former death row inmates to the \"Supermax\" in Colorado.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has denied a legal attempt, for now, to prevent the U.S. government from transferring death row inmates whose sentences were commuted by then-President Joe Biden to the \"Supermax\" in Colorado, the highest-security federal prison in the country.",
      "U.S. District\u00a0Judge Timothy Kelly in Washington, D.C., ruled Tuesday against issuing a preliminary injunction requested in a lawsuit brought by 21 of the 37 former death row inmates, all of whom saw their sentences changed to life without parole in December.",
      "\"The Court cannot grant that relief \u2014 at least not now,\" Kelly wrote in his opinion, saying that the plaintiffs must first exhaust their administrative appeals within the federal Bureau of Prison's transfer process.",
      "The decision comes as the BOP has said it would not transfer any of the plaintiffs to the \"Supermax,\" also known as the Administrative Maximum Facility, or ADX, until at least the end of May.",
      "\"The Bureau of Prisons offers an administrative process for challenging final designations to ADX, and Plaintiffs have not completed \u2014 or, to the Court's knowledge, even started \u2014 that process,\" Kelly wrote. \"Because the Court lacks discretion to append exceptions to Congress's exhaustion requirement, it will deny Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\"",
      "Nearly all of the former federal death row prisoners remain at the penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana, home to the U.S. government's death chamber. The Biden administration halted federal executions, a departure from President Donald Trump's first term, when 13 federal inmates were put to death in a spree of executions not seen since President Grover Cleveland\u00a0in the late 1800s.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about the judge's ruling.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which is among the legal teams representing the plaintiffs, said it still believes that the inmates \"can be safely housed elsewhere in the federal system,\" and that the BOP agreed with that before the Trump administration's Justice Department stepped in.",
      "\"While the court ruled that it could not order the Bureau of Prisons to leave the plaintiffs in place while they appealed their designations to ADX, the fight is far from over,\" Brian Stull, deputy director of the ACLU's Capital Punishment Project, said in a statement.",
      "Trump was critical of Biden's commutation effort, and on his first day back in office in January, he signed an executive order calling for the U.S. attorney general\u00a0to ensure the commuted death row inmates \"are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.\" He also restored the federal death penalty.",
      "The \"Supermax,\" which sits in a mile-high desert south of Colorado Springs, is also known as \"the Alcatraz of the Rockies\" for its isolated conditions and housing some of the most high-profile prisoners deemed safety risks. They currently include drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n and domestic terrorists Eric Rudolph, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber, whose federal death sentence was not commuted by Biden.",
      "The former death row inmates challenging the government's plan to transfer them to the \"Supermax\" said in their complaint, filed in April in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, that doing so would be unconstitutional.",
      "Their legal teams said the condemned inmates were given interviews in early April to assess whether they should be moved to the \"Supermax.\" But the complaint alleges the hearings were a \"sham\" because the BOP had already designated some of them under a \"security threat\" classification that assumes they are promoting violence or terrorist activity in gangs, and can't be safely housed in the general population.",
      "The plaintiffs attempted to show proof that they are not threats, including how despite being on death row they had successful programming and clean disciplinary records, were getting their health care needs met and would be harmed if they were \"subjected to extreme isolation at ADX,\" according to the complaint.",
      "\"Unsurprisingly, following each Plaintiff's hearing, and in some cases within minutes or hours, the Hearing Administrator recommended that ADX placement was 'warranted' for every one of them,\" the complaint says.",
      "\"By categorically condemning Plaintiffs to indefinite incarceration in harsh conditions in response to their receipt of clemency from the previous President, it exceeds the statutory authority granted to the Attorney General and her deputy, and is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion,\" the suit adds.",
      "The federal government said in its response to the complaint that the BOP has the statutory authority to designate where inmates can be held, the inmates went through a multilayered hearing process and have had the right to appeal, and \"Supermax\" inmates are not entirely isolated.",
      "According to the Justice Department attorneys, the prison participates in a federal law known as the First Step Act, which \"provides quarterly incentives to reward inmates for completing certain programming,\" and may be offered \"Starbucks coffee, pizza, and candy that is not available at Commissary.\"",
      "And unlike at the special confinement unit in Terre Haute, \"inmates in the ADX may have the opportunity to 'step down' through a progression of housing with fewer restrictions and additional freedoms to the point where they may be transferred out of the ADX entirely to a high-security institution,\" the government's response said.",
      "Kelly concluded in his ruling that the BOP would, in this case, continue to follow what it has done historically by not transferring inmates to the \"Supermax\" until remedies for appeal are worn out.",
      "\"Of course, if Defendants do transfer any Plaintiffs to ADX before those appeals conclude, or truncate those appeals in an unusual way, such a departure from the BOP's ordinary practice would support Plaintiffs' argument that the designation process at issue here is hardly business as usual for the Bureau,\" Kelly said. \"And it would raise serious questions about who is calling the shots: BOP or someone outside that agency.\""

      "NEW YORK \u2014 Krista Vasquez had her heart set on getting married in a body-hugging, halter-style gown from Spain. In April, the Atlanta paramedic learned her dream dress would cost nearly $300 more because of new U.S. tariffs on imported goods.",
      "With little wiggle room in her timing, the bride-to-be quickly checked around for similar styles. The story was the same: any dresses from Europe would come with tariff-driven price increases ranging from $150 to $400. And that was before President Donald Trump said he would increase the tariff on goods produced in the European Union from 10% to 50%.",
      "Vasquez, 33, went with her first choice, fearing shipping delays or additional costs like a rush fee before her October wedding if she placed an order elsewhere.",

Not many goods used in the wedding industry remain untouched by the tariffs Trump has imposed since returning to office. How much of the import taxes get passed down to consumers is up to florists, photographers, caterers and myriad other vendors and intermediaries, such as wholesalers.",
      "Olivia Sever, a 28-year-old online content creator in San Diego, has a lot of wedding shopping ahead of her. Much of what she wants may cost more because of tariffs. An immediate concern is some of her paper goods. Her wedding planner has already flagged a 10% price increase for the menus, place cards and signage she wanted for her September celebration in Hawaii.",
      "Sever said shifting to American goods isn\u2019t always cost-effective. For instance, flowers grown in Hawaii are in high demand, with increased prices to match, in response to 10% tariffs imposed on a large number of imports around the world. That includes flowers from Ecuador, Colombia and other countries that grow the bulk of the flowers the U.S. imports.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just so many unknowns, but we have our budget and we\u2019re trying to work within our budget,\u201d Sever said. \u201cIf that means we can\u2019t get these, you know, specific shell cups I want, then we just won\u2019t get them and we\u2019ll get something else.\u201d",

      "Not all of Christianson\u2019s cost woes are tariff-driven. The chocolate industry was already struggling because of a cocoa bean shortage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a small business with just myself as my employee. I\u2019ve seen at minimum a 20% increase in just the chocolate I use. It\u2019s a type of chocolate that I\u2019ve built into my recipes. Changing brands isn\u2019t acceptable,\u201d Christianson said.",
      "The imported white chocolate in her white chocolate mud cake, a popular flavor, shot up from $75 or $100 per cake to $150. She used nearly 10 pounds of it in a recent order, a cake that had five tiers.",
      "Christianson may have to come up with new recipes based on less expensive ingredients. In the meantime, she said, she\u2019s eating the cost of tariffs for clients already on her books.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have it in my contract where I can raise prices for unexpected events like this,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s something I have to add to new contracts for my future couples.\u201d",

      "Almost all bridal gowns are made in China or other parts of Asia \u2014 and so are many of the fabrics, buttons, zippers and other materials used, according to the National Bridal Retailers Association. Manufacturing in those countries, where labor generally costs less, has put the price of high-quality bridal gowns within reach for many American families.",
      "Retailers and manufacturers say the U.S. lacks enough skilled labor and production of specialized materials to fully serve the market. Skilled seamstresses are hard to find and often come from older generations.",
      "\u201cThe materials that we sell in a bridal shop include lace, beadwork, boning for the corsetry. We don\u2019t really make stuff like that in this country. There just aren\u2019t very many designers who create and put their whole looks together in this nation,\u201d said Christine Greenberg, founder and co-owner of the Urban Set Bride boutique in Richmond, Virginia.",
      "\u201cThe designs done here are normally very simple designs. You don\u2019t see a lot of American-made gowns that have a lot of detail, a lot of embroidered lace, and that\u2019s a really popular wedding gown style,\u201d she said.",
      "Many designers with gowns labeled made in the U.S. still are using imported materials, Greenberg noted.",
      "If Trump\u2019s highest tariffs on China are reinstated after a current pause, Greenberg said her small business will pay between $85,000 and $100,000 extra in import taxes this year.",
      "\u201cFor a small, family-owned business that only hosts one bride at a time, this will absolutely lead us and many others to close for good,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy American when the products don\u2019t exist.\u201d",

      "Wyndrum, who works directly with wholesalers and growers, said the U.S. flower industry isn\u2019t capable at the moment of absorbing all the production from elsewhere. She does a lot of business with U.S. suppliers, though, and sees a huge opportunity for growth stateside.",

      "Researchers in Spain say they have found evidence that Neanderthals were capable of creating art \u2014 challenging the idea that art began with the modern humans who succeeded them.",
      "The canvas was a quartz-rich granite pebble that was excavated from a rock shelter in central Spain in 2022, in a layer dating back between 42,000 and 43,000 years. Measuring more than 8 inches long, the pebble has curves and indentations that make it resemble a human face.",
      "In the middle of its surface is a single red dot, right where a nose would be, researchers said in a study published Saturday in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, adding that it appeared to be a non-utilitarian object rather than a tool.",
      "\u201cFrom the outset we could tell it was peculiar,\u201d said David \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, lead author of the paper.",
      "Analysis showed that the red dot consisted of ochre, a natural earth pigment. The next step was to determine how it got there.",
      "While not visible to the naked eye, the red dot was confirmed by Spanish forensic police to be a fingerprint, leaving \u201cno doubt\u201d that it was applied to the stone intentionally by a finger dipped in ochre, \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, an archaeologist at Complutense University in Madrid, said in an email on Tuesday.",
      "The researchers postulate that the Neanderthal, who based on the fingerprint was possibly an adult male, perceived the pebble as resembling a face \u2014 a psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia \u2014 and was inspired to complete the depiction, creating \u201cone of the oldest known abstractions of a human face in the prehistoric record.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be a clear act of symbolization \u2014 apparently very simple, yet meaningful,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "The discovery is \u201cdoubly exceptional\u201d since it\u2019s the \u201cmost complete\u201d Neanderthal fingerprint identified to date, apart from a partial one previously found in Germany, the researchers said.",
      "Neanderthals, a distinct species that went extinct around 40,000 years ago, lived alongside early modern humans in Europe, Asia and the Middle East for at least part of their existence. Characterized by a large nose and relatively short and stocky bodies, the species is very closely related to humans, or Homo sapiens.",
      "The remains of Neanderthals do not show clear evidence of lower intelligence than modern humans, some scientists have argued.",
      "The stone is \u201cone of a small but growing number of discoveries that point to the existence of symbolic behavior among Neanderthals,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "However, it\u2019s \u201cclearly an isolated object, with no known parallels\u201d that can be used for comparison, he added.",
      "\u201cWe should not try to draw direct analogies between the Neanderthal and sapiens worlds,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said, as Neanderthals did not create a visual symbolic system as complex and diverse as the one developed by Homo sapiens.",
      "\u201cThis pebble doesn\u2019t solve the mystery, but it offers one more clue suggesting the presence of a complex mind \u2014 one capable of producing symbols,\u201d he said."

      "A handful of Trump\u2019s recent pardons show a shift in Justice Department priorities. British authorities garner praise for swift reaction to incident involving a vehicle in Liverpool. And a woman is in a coma after a break-in at the home of Beanie Babies billionaire Ty Warner.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know today.",
      "Trump's pardons highlight Justice Department's pullback from public corruption cases",
      "When President Donald Trump announced this week that he would pardon Scott Jenkins, the former sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, it furthered a shifting mission within the Justice Department: to de-emphasize public corruption cases.",
      "Jenkins\u2019 name and his case are likely not widely recognized by the general public. In March, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of accepting over $75,000 in exchange for giving law enforcement authority to local businessmen, as well as two undercover FBI special agents. All of Jenkins\u2019 co-defendants pleaded guilty.",
      "This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.",
      "Still, Trump sees him as a \u201cvictim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice\u201d who \u201cdoesn\u2019t deserve to spend a single day in jail.\u201d It\u2019s part of a broader pattern, in which he has pardoned at least four supportive former public officials who were convicted of financial improprieties.",
      "That includes: Rod Blagojevich, the Democratic former governor of Illinois, over corruption charges related to bribery; Republican former Tennessee state Sen. Brian Kelsey over a campaign finance-related fraud conviction; and Republican former Las Vegas City Council member Michele Fiore, who was convicted on conspiracy and wire fraud charges and had been set to be sentenced this month. Also notably, the Trump administration moved to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams earlier this year.",
      "And yesterday, the president said he plans to pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley, the pair known for their roles on the reality TV show \u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d who are serving time for bilking banks out of tens of millions of dollars.",
      "Trump, who faced two separate federal criminal cases that were dropped after his re-election, has long argued that he was a victim of the weaponization of the DOJ and FBI, and he has been sympathetic to those who make similar claims. Since Trump took office, the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity Section has shrunk both in size and influence, while the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office is shutting down a public corruption squad that was focused on federal corruption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this administration doesn\u2019t believe that tamping down on public corruption is a priority,\u201d said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department official.",

      "A rush to release details after the Liverpool parade incident",
      "Authorities in England announced the arrest of a suspect on suspicion of attempted murder after a vehicle drove through a crowd of soccer fans in Liverpool\u2019s city center, leaving dozens injured. Eleven people remained hospitalized as of yesterday.",
      "When the incident initially made national newscasts on Monday, it didn\u2019t take long for notorious right-wing voices on social media to label it a \u201csuspect terrorist attack\u201d and for others to speculate that the driver had been motivated by Islamic extremism. But authorities shut down those rumors within a couple of hours. First, police described the suspect as a 53-year-old white British male from the Liverpool area. A few hours later, police said the incident was not being investigated as terrorism-related.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never known a case like this before where they\u2019ve given the ethnicity and the race of the individual who was involved in it,\u201d Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent, told BBC Radio 5 Live. But the remarkably swift release of details in Monday\u2019s incident, which authorities and civilians praised, was a sign of lessons learned after a deadly stabbing attack last year sparked violent riots in the town of Southport.

      "Violent break-in at Beanie Babies billionaire\u2019s mansion",
      "A woman is in a coma and a suspect has been arrested after a break-in at the California home of Beanie Babies billionaire Ty Warner, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney\u2019s office said in a criminal complaint. The incident happened last week when the suspect, identified as 42-year-old Russell Maxwell Phay, allegedly broke into the home, \u201cviolently\u201d beat a woman and then barricaded himself in an upstairs bathroom, according to the Santa Barbara County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Office. Phay was apprehended after he \u201cattempted to flee by climbing out of\u201d the bathroom window.",
      "The victim was identified through public records and social media as Linda Malek-Aslanian, whose LinkedIn profile identifies her as a financial services professional from New York. Warner, who is known for being reclusive, was at home at the time of the attack but not harmed.",

      "Onosato, whose real name is Daiki Nakamura, is only 24 and was promoted Wednesday to sumo\u2019s top rank by the Japan Sumo Association. Onosato was promoted by winning last week\u2019s Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, which came after he won another prestigious tournament in March.",
      "Onosato is from Ishikawa prefecture, which was hit on Jan. 1, 2024, by a devastating earthquake and tsunami that killed about 600 people and caused widespread damage. Much of the destruction was centered on an area known as the Noto Peninsula.",

      "The Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 superstar, a two-way player who pitches and bats as a designated hitter, has not thrown to batters off a mound in 641 days after elbow surgery in September 2023. But in a simulated game before the Dodgers\u2019 matchup with the New York Mets at Citi Field on Sunday, Ohtani threw 22 pitches to five batters.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, pitching coach Mark Prior and teammates looked on from a few feet away. It was the first sign that Ohtani \u2014 a three-time MVP \u2014 could be pitching in a real game soon.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t thrown in a while, so it was nice to be able to feel like I was a pitcher,\u201d Ohtani said through interpreter Will Ireton after the Dodgers\u2019 3-1 loss to the Mets. \u201cI just kind of remembered those days when I used to have a lot of good memories as a pitcher.\u201d",
      "Ohtani reportedly threw mostly fastballs, cutters and sinkers with two sweepers and a sinker. His fastball ranged from 94 to 97 mph.",
      "After he began his MLB career with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani pitched five seasons in Anaheim. When he signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December 2023, the expectation was that that would continue. But two operations on his elbow paused that dream, and so far he has only hit with the Dodgers.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve gotten so used to seeing him as a hitter,\u201d Roberts said after Ohtani threw. \u201cSo to see him on the mound just solely as a pitcher, it was different. And certainly exciting for all of us.\u201d",
      "Prior said he was impressed with what he saw after such a long layoff.",
      "\u201cHe looks good. He looked healthy,\u201d Prior said. \u201cThat\u2019s always the main thing with facing hitters \u2014 that he feels confident, his endurance is good, he maintained his stuff. From that standpoint, it was good. Pitch movement-wise, it looked good, too.\u201d",

      "Caro and renowned Mexican star Cecilia Su\u00e1rez have a creative partnership that spans almost two decades. The longtime friends and collaborators have worked on more than six projects together, including Caro\u2019s first short film \u201cGente Bien... Atascada\u201d (2007), his debut feature film \u201cNo S\u00e9 Si Cortarme Las Venas O Dej\u00e1rmelas Largas\u201d (2013), the Netflix series \u201cCasa de las Flores\u201d (2018) and their latest series, \u201cSerpientes y Escaleras,\u201d which translates to \u201cSnakes and Ladders.\u201d",

      "Their latest comedy, \u201cSerpientes y Escaleras,\u201d follows Su\u00e1rez as Dora, the rigid yet determined prefect of a prestigious school. At first glance, she\u2019s a seemingly insignificant employee. But when she gets caught up in a family quarrel between two 8-year-old students and their pompous parents, it jeopardizes her lifelong dream of becoming school principal.",
      "\u201cI have the liberty of casting who I want to because I write the stories,\u201d Caro candidly says. \u201cAnd I have the privilege and am fortunate to have lifelong friends who I think are excellent performers.\u201d",

      "The risk they take with \u201cSerpientes y Escaleras\u201d is asking people about their relationship and views on power, ambition and \u201cto what extent we are willing to go outside our ethical and moral frameworks.\u201d The title refers to people having the ability to be snakes climbing the ladder.",
      "\u201cEach person has different concepts of morality,\u201d Caro says, not just in life but on the show. \u201cPut that concept on the table, it starts a conversation \u2014 and that\u2019s what entertainment is about.\u201d",
      "When it comes to Su\u00e1rez's character, Dora, she is faced with having to keep the secrets of very powerful and very important figures. Using their actions and lies against them would put her life at risk \u2014 but it would also help her get her dream job.",

      "\u201cWhen she makes that decision,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says, \u201cIt brings a slew of changes in her personal and professional life and her family. It affects everything in her path and evidently changes and transforms her life and surroundings.\u201d",
      "While the show may deal with heavy topics about ethics and morals, the entertaining and choreographed title sequence is a great example of Caro\u2019s signature comical and creative touch. Su\u00e1rez\u2019s involvement is the cherry on top.",
      "\u201cIt sets the tone for the series,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you see the sequence in the first minutes of the show, one thinks, \u2018Well, now anything can happen.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve done that for years. When I used to travel on my bus, I would start cooking a few days before so I would have good food that I was going to be craving when I\u2019m out on the road, when you don\u2019t always find what you want,\u201d Parton recalls. \u201cI would always have things like that in my freezer on my bus.\u201d",
      "The \u201c9 to 5\u201d singer is offering her Southern favorites \u2014 beef pot roast, chicken and dumplings and country fried steak \u2014 all for under $5.",
      "The line of frozen meals also features a peach cobbler, which sits at a retail price of $9.99. Parton adds the dessert \u201cserves lot of people \u2014 and even the single serves are big, big portions.\u201d",
      "This isn't the first time Parton has partnered with Conagra to bring her go-to recipes to her fans. Since 2022, the singer has worked with Duncan Hines, which is owned by Conagra, to create custom cake mixes, frosting, brownies, biscuits, pancakes and muffins, among other Southern-style classics.",
      "In September, Parton released a cookbook, \u201cGood Lookin\u2019 Cookin\u2019,\u201d with her sister, Rachel Parton George. The siblings shared \u201ca year of meals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cThese are just rich and hearty, and just got all the seasoning in the world. We just wanted to have things that would be easy to freeze, easy to serve and really stay tasty.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hate bland frozen foods. So this is not bland,\u201d Parton continues, explaining that she was involved in the tasting process, instructing the kitchen to add \u201ca little more butter or a little more salt or a little more pepper\u201d where needed.",
      "Unlike other frozen meal options that are \u201cnot something you want to eat every day,\u201d her dishes are \u201cthe kind of stuff you crave.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever you grew up with \u2014 if you had a family of love and you loved grandmas and you loved mama and your aunts that made all that good food, you\u2019re going to want to eat that,\u201d Parton says. \u201cThat was another thing that inspired the idea of having just good, tasty, hearty Southern food be frozen.\u201d"

      "The book on Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is now closed. After 66 episodes strung out over eight years, following the adventures of titular Handmaid Offred/June (Elisabeth Moss), the series ended Tuesday night with some happy endings, some shocking tragedies \u2014 and some hope for the future. June has faced all three.",
      "But how to wrap up this story? Over the seasons we went from June\u2019s ordeal as the forced Handmaid to an infertile couple in a theocratic society called Gilead (made up of much of the former United States), to her rebellion, escape and vengeance, all while never vowing to abandon her daughter Hannah, who had been taken from her.",
      "It\u2019s a lot to conclude on, given that it would be hard to imagine a satisfying ending that didn\u2019t end with the complete overthrow of Gilead. But the series, whose final episode was called \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d stuck the landing with a shocking penultimate episode last week (\"Execution\") and a finale (\"The Handmaid's Tale\") that tied up some loose ends \u2014 while also laying the groundwork for the sequel series, \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d set to air in the near future.",
      "So let\u2019s go back and see just how \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d concluded its tale \u2014 and as ever, blessed is the fruit.",
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead!",
      "Why was 'Execution' such a big deal?",
      "The series\u2019 final episode was important, but a lot of it served as epilogue and a place to get some closure for our favorite performers.",
      "Last week\u2019s episode, \u201cExecution,\u201d was arguably the true climax of the series \u2014 in which multiple characters, including June, Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) and Joseph (Bradley Whitford) conspired to put a bomb on a plane carrying key Commanders.",
      "Not only did it take out many of the most important of Gilead\u2019s leaders, Joseph (who carried the explosive) and Nick (Max Minghella) were also on the plane. Instantly, Gilead\u2019s threat was dealt a mortal blow, if not entirely neutralized.",
      "What happened to June in the final episode?",
      "June\u2019s role in this epilogue-esque episode was more to report on what came after the plane exploded: United States jets invaded Gilead, bombing Boston and liberating the state \u2014 then spreading to other states, though not eliminating the theocracy entirely.",
      "June also underwent a lot of catharsis \u2014 burning her Handmaid\u2019s robe in a street bonfire; meeting up with her mother Holly (Cherry Jones); who journeyed from Alaska with baby Nichole; and trying to figure out her future. She wasn\u2019t abandoning locating Hannah, primarily, and we saw both flashbacks and dream sequences involving the little girl she had with Luke (O-T Fagbenle). But more than one character suggested she should write her experiences in a book for future generations, and to honor those who supported her along the way.",
      "Will Luke and June stay together?",
      "They clearly love one another, but they now have different ideas of how to fight the remnants of Gilead. June tells Nichole that she will have to leave her with her grandmother again, to help free all the girls in danger in Gilead \u2014 though we also know that this means tracking down Hannah. Luke, on the other hand, wants to be more involved with guerilla fighting. They share a warm, caring moment together that is also not physical before agreeing that they will meet again somewhere, sometime.",
      "As June told her mother, \u201cFighting may not get us everything, but we don\u2019t have a choice because not fighting is what got us Gilead in the first place. And Gilead doesn\u2019t need to be beaten \u2014 it needs to be broken.\u201d",
      "What about other key characters?",
      "Emily (Alexis Bledel): The former professor and June\u2019s original shopping partner became allies, and after escape Emily started a family in Canada. But she fell off the radar \u2014 until turning up in Boston, outside a former ice cream parlor, startling June. She and June took a stroll along the Charles, past where Handmaids used to be strung up and now features hanged Guardians, and they reflected on the changes in their lives. \u201cRage is a gift from God; it\u2019s meant to be shared with the most deserving,\u201d Emily told June.",
      "Serena: Now a stateless refuge, Serena is last seen in a shelter with her newborn Noah, telling him he\u2019s all she needs. It\u2019s a kind of happily-ever-after, but she\u2019s been stripped of all status and societal respect at this stage.",
      "Janine (Madeline Brewer): A longtime Handmaid compatriot of June's, Janine underwent some of the worst torments of the series, including losing her eye. Her baby ended up with Naomi (Ever Carradine) and Joseph\u2019s family, but in a surprise revelation, both Janine and her child were handed off\u00a0by Naomi and Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) to conquering U.S. representatives \u2014 and June, who was brought along as a \u201cfamiliar face.\u201d",
      "Moira (Samira Wiley): Alas, while Moira is seen here and there in the episode, there's no warm farewell or wrap-up to June's most loyal best friend.",
      "What happens next for June \u2014 and the world of \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019?",
      "June is certainly going to keep fighting. But she might have a project in mind, first: a memoir. After both Luke and Holly urge her to write about her experiences, the last scenes of the show featured June returning to the Waterford house, which is standing empty and partially burned. She went upstairs to her old garret and stood in front of the window where we first saw her in the Handmaid\u2019s outfit.",
      "She pulled out a recording device and started speaking, outlining the furniture in the room and the window, noting it\u2019s not a means of escape. Where would a Handmaid go, after all? But in a nice touch, those are the same words she spoke in the very first episode (they\u2019re also very similar to some of the first words in the original book by Margaret Atwood). Only now, as we saw June triumphant over not just her circumstances but the entirety of Gilead, the words had a lot more meaning. She was taking control of her story \u2014 and she was far from being done writing it at the same time.",
      "How does the finale set up 'The Testaments'?",
      "As for \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d the next series in the \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d world, it will be based on Atwood\u2019s 2019 novel, set 15 years in the future from the end of \u201cTale.\u201d Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) will be the new narrator of the story and focus on a woman named Agnes in Gilead and Daisy, a woman in Canada. Atwood\u2019s book has specific secrets to be revealed about both women, but it\u2019s not known if the series will also head in that direction."

    "story": [
      "Alexis Roderick Joel, the wife of Billy Joel, is speaking out for the first time about her husband following the 76-year-old singer-songwriter's diagnosis with a rare brain disorder.",
      "Last week, the \"Piano Man\" revealed that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus, a form of reversible dementia, and would be canceling his upcoming U.S. tour dates.",
      "On May 26, Billy Joel's wife took to social media to thank fans for their support.",
      "\u201cThank you for the outpouring of love and support. We are so grateful for the wonderful care and swift diagnosis we received. Bill is beloved by so many, and to us, he is a father and husband who is at the center of our world,\" Alexis Roderick Joel wrote in the caption of an Instagram post on his account.",
      "\"We are hopeful for his recovery. We look forward to seeing you all in the future,\" she continued.",
      "Along with the update, Alexis Roderick Joel shared a photo of herself with Billy Joel and their daughters, Della Rose and Remy.",
      "Billy Joel initially postponed tour dates in March \u201cdue to a medical condition,\" according to his website, which prompted questions about the singer's health.",
      "On May 23, Billy Joel announced in a statement on social media that he was recently diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus and would be canceling all of his scheduled concert dates.",
      "According to the statement, the singer's condition has been worsened by recent performances, leading to problems with his hearing, vision and balance. As directed by his doctor, Billy Joel is doing physical therapy and refraining from performing while he recovers.",
      "Alexis Roderick Joel said the family is \"hopeful\" for his recovery from the disorder.",
      "In addition to his wife, Billy Joel also has the support of his ex Christie Brinkley and their daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, who posted heartfelt tributes to him on social media over the weekend.",
      "Brinkley, who was married to Billy Joel for nine years, wrote on Instagram that the Brinkley family was sending \u201cgood wishes for a full and speedy recovery.\u201d",

      "What is normal pressure hydrocephalus?",
      "NPH is a rare, but reversible, type of dementia. It occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside the skull and puts pressure on the brain, per the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The increase in pressure can affect brain functioning and cause problems with thinking, short-term memory, communication and movement. Symptoms include unsteady gait, trouble walking, balance issues, urinary incontinence, confusion, forgetfulness and moodiness, TODAY.com previously reported.",
      "These can mimic the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Parkinson's disease, and NPH is often misdiagnosed. NPH is most common in people over the age of 65.",
      "Unlike most other forms of dementia, which are progressive and irreversible, NPH may be controlled or reversed with proper treatment. Doctors may perform a spinal tap to temporarily remove excess fluid, or surgery to implant a shunt in the brain, which allows fluid to drain into the stomach, TODAY.com previously reported. This resolves symptoms for many NPH patients.",
      "As of May 26, Billy Joel has not released any further details about specific treatments.",
      "Billy Joel's latest diagnosis isn't the only health hurdle the singer has faced during his long career.",
      "In recent years, Billy Joel battled a viral infection that forced him to take vocal rest and had a back surgery, which led him to lose 50 pounds. Previously, the singer has suffered from mental health issues and sought treatment for alcohol abuse."

      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev raised the specter of a World War III on Tuesday, as the rhetoric between the White House and the Kremlin ramped up over the war in Ukraine.",
      "Medvedev, now a top security official, was responding to President Donald Trump's post on Truth Social berating his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, as Moscow continued to rain strikes down on its neighbor.",
      "\u201cWhat Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t realize is that if it weren\u2019t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD,\u201d wrote Trump, who appears to be losing patience over the lack of a ceasefire deal, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s playing with fire!\u201d",
      "Around three hours later, Medvedev took to X, writing, \u201cI only know of one REALLY BAD thing \u2014 WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!\u201d",
      "This in turn drew an almost immediate rebuke from Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who called Medvedev\u2019s remarks \u201creckless\u201d in a post on X. Cautioning that Russia was stoking fears of another world war, Kellogg wrote that it was \u201cunfitting of a world power.\u201d",
      "Trump, he added, has been working toward brokering a truce in the war that entered its fourth year in February and has claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov appeared to play down the tension during a press briefing Wednesday, during which he thanked Trump \u201cpersonally\u201d for his efforts. But, he said, \u201cat the same time there are a lot of nuances based on the national interests, which cannot be sacrificed and which neither side will sacrifice.\u201d",
      "While Putin has never raised the specter of a world war, he has broached the use of nuclear weapons on several occasions since he launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "In a speech in Moscow\u2019s Red Square last May, the Russian leader vowed to stand firm against attempts by Ukraine's Western allies to contain Russia. \u201cWe will not let anyone threaten us,\u201d he said. \u201cOur strategic forces are always at combat readiness,\u201d he added referring to Russia\u2019s arsenal of nuclear weapons, the world\u2019s largest.",
      "Trump, who promised on multiple occasions to end the war within 24 hours of taking office, has found the reality much different since beginning his second term, while offering mixed messages about Putin.",
      "Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader with whom he can do business and the pair had a friendly, if fruitless, phone call last week. Shortly afterward, Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine would \u201cimmediately start negotiations towards a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "But as Putin has stalled on the peace talks, Trump's frustration appears to have grown with the Russian leader, whom he called \u201ccrazy\u201d in a post on Truth Social on Sunday after Moscow launched widespread strikes on Ukraine. The Kremlin dismissed his comments as \u201cemotional overload.\u201d",
      "Russia previously said it was working on a memorandum of understanding outlining Moscow\u2019s demands as part of the negotiations with Kyiv. But Tuesday, Kellogg said the United States was still awaiting \u201creceipt of RU Memorandum (Term Sheet) that you promised a week ago.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in a statement that the Kremlin was continuing to draft that memorandum and that it would include a timeline for a peace agreement and potential ceasefire scenarios.",
      "She added that this would be sent to Ukraine, which has previously rejected Russian demands that it never join NATO, accept permanent \u201cneutrality\u201d between Moscow and the West, and cede its demand for four territories in the east of the country that Russia illegally annexed months after the war began.",
      "Inside Ukraine, Russian forces continue their slow grind forward on the battlefield. Ukrainian officials said one person was killed and more than two dozen injured by ballistic missile strikes across the country overnight.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet with new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Wednesday, his office said in a statement.",
      "The two leaders are expected to discuss Kyiv\u2019s readiness to respond to Russian strikes and threats, including increasing the production of drones and missiles, Zelenskyy said in his overnight address Wednesday.",
      "It comes after Merz said Tuesday that his government would lift all range restrictions on weapons it sends to Ukraine, allowing Kyiv to defend itself by attacking military positions deep in Russia.",
      "Peskov called Merz\u2019s decision  \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d adding, \u201call this in a big way goes against the peace efforts, against the peace process that is beginning and is still in a very fragile state.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, the former surgeon at the center of France\u2019s largest-ever child sexual abuse case, was handed a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison Wednesday as his three-month-long trial reached its end.",
      "French courts convicted Le Scouarnec, 74, of sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades, most of them girls and boys whose average age was 11. Many were assaulted while they were under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors said.",
      "Himself a father of three, Le Scouarnec confessed to committing \u201chideous acts\u201d during the trial in the northwestern town of Vannes in the region of Brittany, where he admitted to all of his charges.",
      "\u201cI am not asking the court for leniency,\u201d Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement, adding, \u201csimply grant me the right to become a better person.\u201d",
      "His sentence will run concurrently with the 15 years he is serving after he was found guilty in 2020 of raping a young neighbor and three others when they were children.",
      "The court said Le Scouarnec's sentence cannot be adjusted until he has served two-thirds of it, in order to prevent recidivism, according to French news outlet, Le Monde. The judges also followed the public prosecutor\u2019s recommendations on the sentence.",
      "After lawyers for some of the victims complained that he could be released by 2030 if his pretrial detention and parole eligibility were taken into account, the prosecution made a rare request that he be held in a treatment center under supervision even after his release. It was not clear if the court granted this request.",
      "Hundreds of witnesses testified at the trial, including Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend. Now in their 40s, both said he assaulted them in the early 1980s. However, French law did not allow him to be prosecuted for their alleged abuse because it happened too long ago.",
      "Many victims have said they don\u2019t remember being assaulted, but police were able to build a case against Le Scouarnec because he meticulously cataloged his abuse in digital diaries.",
      "In France it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged.",
      "The case has put a spotlight on the French medical system, which allowed Le Scouarnec to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse.",
      "Lawyers for some of the victims said the once-respected local doctor should have been stripped of his medical privileges after that case. Instead, Le Scouarnec worked across nine public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates also hope the case will prompt a hard look at what they call a lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d Francesca Satta, a lawyer who represented 10 victims and families said previously, adding, \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "During the trial, many victims watched the proceedings through a video link in a 450-seat auditorium, a short walk from the courthouse, which was too small to cope with the number of people who wanted to watch the case unfold. Two other transmission rooms in a former law school broadcasted the trial to the media and spectators."

      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the linchpin of a new aid system that would wrest distribution away from aid groups led by the U.N., which have carried out a massive operation moving food, medicine, fuel, tents and other supplies across Gaza since the war began in October 2023.",
      "The new mechanism limits food distribution to a small number of hubs under guard of armed contractors, where people must go to pick it up. Currently four hubs have been set up, all close to Israeli military positions.",
      "Israel has demanded an alternative plan because it accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid. The United Nations and aid groups deny there is significant diversion. They reject the new mechanism, saying it allows Israel to use food as a weapon, violates humanitarian principles and won't be effective.",
      "Israel blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for nearly three months, pushing the territory toward famine. Last week, it allowed in a trickle of supplies, saying it would let the U.N. distribute it only until GHF was running.",
      "The Hamas-run Interior Ministry on Monday warned Palestinians in Gaza against dealing with GHF.",
      "So, how will this plan work, who's behind it and why are aid groups pushing back?",
      "GHF said it moved trucks of food to its hubs on Monday and began distribution, without giving details on how much aid was distributed. It said the flow of supplies would be \u201cincreasing each day.\u201d It has said it plans to reach more than 1 million Palestinians by the end of the week. Gaza has a population of around 2.3 million.",
      "The Israeli military said two of the four hubs started distributing food, both in the Rafah area in the southernmost end of Gaza, where few Palestinians are located. On Tuesday, thousands of Palestinians walked from tent camps outside the city of Khan Younis, crossing Israeli military lines, to reach the distribution points.",
      "At one point on Tuesday, chaos erupted as Palestinians overwhelmed a hub outside Rafah, breaking through fences. Nearby Israeli troops fired warning shots, sending people fleeing in panic. The military later said the situation was brought under control but at least three injured Palestinians were seen being brought from the scene.",
      "GHF publicly launched early this year and is run by a group of American security contractors, ex-military officers and humanitarian aid officials. It has the support of Israel and the United States.",
      "Until resigning, Jake Wood was the face of the foundation. Wood is a U.S. military veteran and co-founder of a disaster relief group called Team Rubicon. He said Sunday night he was resigning because it was clear the organization would not be allowed to operate independently.",
      "It's unclear who will now run GHF.",
      "A proposal circulated by the group earlier this month and obtained by the AP included several names, including the former director of the U.N. World Food Program, David Beasley. Neither Beasley nor GHF have confirmed his involvement.",
      "It's also unclear who is funding GHF. It claims to have more than $100 million in commitments from a European Union government but has not named the donor. The U.S. and Israel have said they are not funding it.",
      "The GHF's plan to centralize distribution through hubs is similar to ones designed by Israel.",
      "It says each of its initial four hubs would serve meals for roughly 300,000 people. It has said it will eventually be able to meet the needs of 2 million people. It said it will create more hubs within 30 days, including in the north, but did not specify their exact locations.",
      "Aid will be delivered with the help of private subcontractors transporting supplies in armored vehicles from the Gaza border to the hubs, where they will also provide security. It said the aim is to deter criminal gangs or militants from redirecting aid.",
      "One of the hubs is in central Gaza, close to the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land held by Israeli troops, according to a map issued by the Israeli military. The three others are in the area of Rafah, south of the Morag Corridor, another military-held strip.",
      "Almost the entire population is currently in northern Gaza \u2014 where no hub is currently located \u2014 or in central Gaza. They would have to cross through Israeli military lines to reach the hubs near Rafah.",
      "Just before his resignation, Wood spoke of some adjustments, but it is not clear if Israel agreed to them.",
      "In a letter to Israeli officials obtained by the AP, Wood said that until at least eight hubs are operating, the existing U.N.-led system will continue providing food in parallel to GHF. He also said the U.N.-led system would continue in the future to distribute all non-food humanitarian aid \u2014 everything from medical supplies to hygiene items and shelter materials. GHF was not capable of handling those supplies, Wood acknowledged.",
      "In the letter, sent to Israel's military body in charge of aid coordination in Gaza, COGAT, Wood said GHF and Israel had agreed on those terms. There was no confirmation from COGAT, however.",
      "The U.N. and aid groups say that the plan would \u201cweaponize aid\u201d for Israel\u2019s military and political purposes.",
      "They say Israel would have power to determine who receives aid and to force the population to move to where it is being distributed, emptying large parts of the territory. That would potentially violate international laws against forced displacement.",
      "\u201cWe cannot take part in a system that violates humanitarian principles and risks implicating us in serious breaches of international law,\u201d said Shaina Low, communication adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a leading aid group operating in Gaza.",
      "Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that under the aid mechanism, Gaza\u2019s population would eventually be moved to a \u201csterile zone\u201d in Gaza's far south. He said it was for their protection while Israeli forces fight Hamas elsewhere. He also said once the Palestinians enter the area, \u201cthey don\u2019t necessarily go back.\u201d",
      "Israel also says that after Hamas is defeated, it will implement a plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to relocate the territory's population outside Gaza, though it portrays migration as \"voluntary.\" The Palestinians, along with nearly all of the international community, have rejected the idea.",
      "GHF said in a statement it is independent and apolitical and will not be part of any mass displacement. It said its system is fully consistent with humanitarian principles including impartiality and independence.",
      "Israel had previously told aid groups it intends to vet aid recipients and use facial recognition technology. GHF has said food will be given according to need, without eligibility requirements. However, aid groups say recipients will have to pass close to or through Israeli military positions to reach the hubs, exposing them to vetting.",
      "The U.N and aid groups also say the GHF plan cannot possibly meet the needs of Gaza's large and desperate population.",
      "Plans for distributing non-food aid remain uncertain. Also, GHF has said each meal it distributes would have 1,750 calories. That is below the 2,100-calorie per day standard for meals in emergency situations used by the U.N.'s World Health Organization, UNICEF and World Food Program.",
      "Aid workers say the change is simply not necessary.",
      "The U.N. and other aid groups \u201chave shown absolutely that they can meet the needs of that population, when allowed to,\u201d UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said. \u201cWe need to just keep reverting back to what works.\u201d"

      "LIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Images of a car plowing into a large crowd of soccer fans celebrating their team's English Premier League title win had barely made it to national newscasts when notorious right-wing voices started to call the incident a \"suspected terrorist attack\" on social media.",
      "The X account of Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster who is well known as the leader of the English far right, retweeted video of the vehicle knocking down people dressed in Liverpool Football Club\u2019s ketchup-red strip, writing that it looked \"very intentional.\" (The posts were labeled \"admin,\" a probable reference to the fact that Robinson did not write them himself since he was in prison at the time.)",
      "Others swiftly followed suit, opining that the driver had been motivated by Islamic extremism.",
      "Within a couple of hours, Merseyside Police released details on a suspect detained at the scene, describing him as a 53-year-old white British male from the Liverpool area. Officials also urged the public \u201cnot to speculate on the circumstances\u201d surrounding the incident. Within five hours, police had described the incident as \u201cisolated\u201d and not being investigated as terrorism-related.",
      "The release of these details by the British police, most notably the suspect\u2019s race, was remarkably fast.",
      "For many, it was a sign of lessons learned after the 2024 Southport stabbing attack, in which the same police force was pilloried for not sharing enough information soon enough and allowing rumors to run rampant. In this vacuum, speculation turned into calls for action, which soon bloomed into racist riots that rocked Britain in the aftermath of the deadly assault that killed three young girls, with more injured.",
      "In Southport, violent riots erupted last summer after false information shared on social media claimed the suspect in the stabbings was a radical Islamist migrant. Police were accused of failing to share accurate information on the suspect quickly enough, allowing rumors to circulate unchallenged.",
      "On Tuesday, Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram praised Merseyside Police for having \u201chandled the situation fantastically\u201d in an interview with Sky News.",
      "Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent, described the force\u2019s swift release of information, including details on the race of the man arrested in the incident, as \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never known a case like this before where they\u2019ve given the ethnicity and the race of the individual who was involved in it,\u201d Babu told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI think that was to dampen down some of the speculation from the far-right that sort of continues on X even as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that it appeared to be a lesson learned as a direct result of what happened after the Southport attack.",
      "In that case, he noted rumors swelled of the suspect being \u201can asylum seeker who arrived on a boat and it was a Muslim extremist \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said the suspect had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs.",
      "Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims separately said police believed the man arrested had been able to follow an ambulance responding to reports of a member of the public having a heart attack, after a road block was temporarily lifted.",
      "More than 50 people were initially taken to or showed up at hospitals for treatment, with children among those hurt. Eleven people remained in the hospital for ongoing treatment, but all appeared to be in \u201cstable condition\u201d and \u201crecovering well,\u201d police said.",
      "Lessons learned",
      "Darrin Hooper, who traveled with his wife from Maidstone, Kent, just over 30 miles southeast of London, to celebrate Liverpool's win, praised the police\u2019s quick response on the scene as well as on social media.",
      "\u201cIt was a good thing that they announced it straight away,\u201d he said  Tuesday as he stood among a crowd gathered on the edges of scene of Monday's incident, which had been cordoned off.",

      "Sneha Venket, who traveled to the city with her husband, a major Liverpool F.C. fan, all the way from Cologne, Germany, to join in the parade, described the events that unfolded Monday as a \u201cvery bitter end to a very, very happy day.\u201d",
      "Recalling the grim events of last year in the eastern German city of Magdeburg, in which a 9-year-old child and four adults were killed after a car was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market,  Venket, 39, said she wasn\u2019t surprised to see speculation swirl in the aftermath of Monday\u2019s incident. In that case too, Europe\u2019s far right was quick to tap into fears around the deadly attack.",
      "Venket, who is studying screenwriting, said it was important to allow police to investigate before jumping to conclusions, but, she said, \u201cnowadays, it looks like society is more polarized than ever, every society.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Britain\u2019s King Charles III outlined new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s government priorities at the country's Parliament on Tuesday in what is being seen as a show of support in the face of President Donald Trump's threats to annex America's neighbor.",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling,\" he said in the speech, switching between English and French.",
      "The country faces another \"critical moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values that Canadians hold dear and one which the government is determined to protect,\" Charles said. \"The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada\u2019s relationships with partners is also changing.\"",
      "Charles said Carney and Trump \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship,\u201d adding that it was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "Charles, still undergoing cancer treatment, is the nonpartisan head of state in Canada \u2014 a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies \u2014 but he did not write the speech. Instead, he read what was presented to him by Canada\u2019s government in the country\u2019s capital, Ottawa.",
      "Among them was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wore green and orange sneakers with his suit.",
      "\"Every time I come to Canada, a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart,\" Charles said. \"I\u2019ve always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.\"",
      "Concluding his speech, Charles praised Canada as a \"force for good\" in the world.",
      "\"As the anthem reminds us: The true north is indeed strong and free,\" he said, earning a round of applause from lawmakers.",
      "Before the speech, Charles was taken to the Senate of Canada Building in a horse-drawn carriage with Queen Camilla. There, he received the Royal Salute from the 100-person guard of honor from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment before he entered the chamber.",
      "Charles also met Monday with Carney and Mary Simon, Canada's first Indigenous governor general, who is the king\u2019s representative to the country.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the royal family, and it is rare for the monarch to deliver what is known as the Speech from the Throne. The last time was in 1977, when Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, read it for only the second time in her 70-year reign.",
      "But Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said in a statement Monday that Charles\u2019 visit spoke \u201cto the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify.\u201d",
      "It was a change in tone from earlier this month, when he criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against Trump\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since he took office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left the U.K. trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Charles has also made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Even so, Carney this month told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, that Canadians \u201cweren\u2019t impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s invitation to the palace.",
      "\u201cIt was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles will return to the U.K. later Tuesday, after the speech and a visit to Canada\u2019s National War Memorial."

      "On Oct. 5, 2023, as bullets ripped into his apartment and rockets exploded nearby, he said he hid under his bed. When he emerged, he said eight or nine RSF members had surrounded him and asked if he was a member of the military.",
      "Refusing to believe he was a civilian, Ali said they started \u201cbeating me like crazy.\u201d Accusing him of being in the military, he said they \u201cwere just pointing guns at my face, shooting it next to my ears, next to my feet\u201d and threatening to kill him.",

The beatings only stopped at night after other RSF fighters complained about the screaming because they were trying to sleep, Ali added.",
      "After 10 days, Ali said he was allowed to contact his family who provided evidence that he was a civilian. This, he said, led to a complete change in attitude from his captors, who took him somewhere for a shower and gave him new clothes. Over a large meal, he said an RSF member apologized for his mistreatment.",

      "Then he fled Sudan for Egypt, where he is waiting to be resettled by the U.N. Asked whether he accepted the RSF\u2019s apology, he said, \u201cAbsolutely not. They ruined my country.\u201d",

      "Just across the River Nile in the city of Omdurman, Natasha, a British mother of four, said the \u201cbombing became so bad\u201d they had to leave her home where the army had set up positions on the roof. NBC News agreed not to use her last name because she fears for her safety.",
      "With her husband back in the U.K., she said she moved in with her mother-in-law, Asmaa, 70, and over the course of 18 months watched as law and order broke down and armed gangs roamed the neighborhood \u201cstealing from houses and people were getting killed.\u201d",
      "A 12-year-old friend of her son \u201cwas shot by a sniper,\u201d Natasha, 47, tearfully recalled, adding that the bullet \u201cwent through him and it went through his sister.\u201d",
      "His death was the catalyst in her decision to leave her home, she said, adding that electricity and water had begun to cut out and food had become scarce.",
      "With kidnapping common in Sudan, she said she knew her status as a foreigner with white skin made things \u201cvery, very dangerous\u201d for her, so she donned sunglasses and wrapped herself from head to toe before they made their escape in a rickshaw in September.",
      "\u201cI thought: \u2018OK, I might die on my way out. You know, if I don\u2019t do this I\u2019m going to die. I can\u2019t just sit here like this. One of us is going to get shot.\u2019 So it was just a numb feeling,\u201d Natasha said.",
      "She said that her driver cleared RSF checkpoints without stopping, before dropping her off near a military checkpoint.",
      "As they neared, Natasha said soldiers fired above their heads and she quickly waved a piece of white clothing. The shooting stopped and they were allowed across the checkpoint.",
      "\u201cI just remember when my husband\u2019s mum said to me, \u2018That\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. You can take off your shades,\u2019\u201d Natasha said, starting to cry.",
      "After the military regained control of Omdurman, she said she was planning to move to a nicer part of the city and open another kindergarten.",
      "War crimes and hunger",
      "Sudan\u2019s military said Tuesday it had taken full control of the Greater Khartoum region, but the RSF still controls most of the western region of Darfur and some other areas where battles continue to rage.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. In March the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund reported that armed men have raped hundreds of children, including some as young as 1.",
      "On Thursday, the United States said it would impose sanctions on\u00a0Sudan's government after it determined that Sudan used chemical weapons last year. They will include limits on U.S. exports and government lines of credit, and they will take effect around June 6, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Sudan rejected the move and described the allegations as false in a statement.",
      "Nonetheless, 24.6 million people, or around half the population, face acute hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 an organization that sets a scale the United Nations and governments use to assess hunger.",
      "\u201cI did my very best not to leave Sudan, but yeah, the situation just wasn\u2019t really helping,\u201d Ali, the photographer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting better. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d"

      "Researchers in Spain say they have found evidence that Neanderthals were capable of creating art \u2014 challenging the idea that art began with the modern humans who succeeded them.",
      "The canvas was a quartz-rich granite pebble that was excavated from a rock shelter in central Spain in 2022, in a layer dating back between 42,000 and 43,000 years. Measuring more than 8 inches long, the pebble has curves and indentations that make it resemble a human face.",
      "In the middle of its surface is a single red dot, right where a nose would be, researchers said in a study published Saturday in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, adding that it appeared to be a non-utilitarian object rather than a tool.",
      "\u201cFrom the outset we could tell it was peculiar,\u201d said David \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, lead author of the paper.",
      "Analysis showed that the red dot consisted of ochre, a natural earth pigment. The next step was to determine how it got there.",
      "While not visible to the naked eye, the red dot was confirmed by Spanish forensic police to be a fingerprint, leaving \u201cno doubt\u201d that it was applied to the stone intentionally by a finger dipped in ochre, \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, an archaeologist at Complutense University in Madrid, said in an email on Tuesday.",
      "The researchers postulate that the Neanderthal, who based on the fingerprint was possibly an adult male, perceived the pebble as resembling a face \u2014 a psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia \u2014 and was inspired to complete the depiction, creating \u201cone of the oldest known abstractions of a human face in the prehistoric record.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be a clear act of symbolization \u2014 apparently very simple, yet meaningful,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "The discovery is \u201cdoubly exceptional\u201d since it\u2019s the \u201cmost complete\u201d Neanderthal fingerprint identified to date, apart from a partial one previously found in Germany, the researchers said.",
      "Neanderthals, a distinct species that went extinct around 40,000 years ago, lived alongside early modern humans in Europe, Asia and the Middle East for at least part of their existence. Characterized by a large nose and relatively short and stocky bodies, the species is very closely related to humans, or Homo sapiens.",
      "The remains of Neanderthals do not show clear evidence of lower intelligence than modern humans, some scientists have argued.",
      "The stone is \u201cone of a small but growing number of discoveries that point to the existence of symbolic behavior among Neanderthals,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "However, it\u2019s \u201cclearly an isolated object, with no known parallels\u201d that can be used for comparison, he added.",
      "\u201cWe should not try to draw direct analogies between the Neanderthal and sapiens worlds,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said, as Neanderthals did not create a visual symbolic system as complex and diverse as the one developed by Homo sapiens.",
      "\u201cThis pebble doesn\u2019t solve the mystery, but it offers one more clue suggesting the presence of a complex mind \u2014 one capable of producing symbols,\u201d he said."

      "She had the lowest vote count of the six newly elected senators for the state. The Australian Electoral Commission officially declared the poll Tuesday.",
      "The new job will be a \u201cbig adjustment,\u201d said Walker, who starts her six-year term July 1. A federal lawmaker\u2019s base salary is more than 205,000 Australian dollars ($133,000) annually.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few feelings. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d Walker told Australian Broadcasting Corp. after the results were announced late Monday.",
      "\u201cI want to do a good job for South Australians, but I also want to show young people, particularly young women, that this is achievable and this is something that they can do also.

      "Australian National University political historian Frank Bongiorno said unexpected swings can put female candidates into Parliament after seeking apparently unwinnable seats.",

      "\u201cThe fact that we now have not 50%, but 57% is partly a function of obviously just the size of the swing, but it is also, I think, very deliberate changes that have occurred within the Labor Party over about 30 years from what was a very male-dominated culture and environment,\u201d Bongiorno said.",

      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it.

      "McCann told 7News Sydney that from the moment her son started high school, he was subjected to bullying. Even after her son's death, she said, no students were disciplined.",
      "\"None of them were suspended, none of them were expelled. I feel completely let down,\" she told the Australian outlet.",

      "As of Tuesday afternoon, over $7,300 Australian had been raised.",
      "McCann had shared an Instagram post over the weekend, announcing her son\u2019s death.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, have agreed to an exchange of prisoners, Russia's foreign minister said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is a man who wants results,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in Turkey, claiming that Trump's efforts were being \u201csabotaged\u201d by some European countries as he referred to ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "Lavrov did not provide further details on the exchange and the State Department did not immediately respond to NBC News' requests for comment.",
      "Russia has maintained that it wants to end the war in Ukraine, which began when Putin launched an invasion in 2022, but has not backed away from its maximalist demands that Ukraine essentially disarm and hand over vast swaths of territory.",
      "If the deal is confirmed by the State Department and comes to fruition, it will be the first exchange since last month, when a Russian-American woman, former-ballerina Ksenia Karelina, was freed after being imprisoned for treason by Russia. She was released in exchange for Russian national Arthur Petrov, the State Department said at the time.",
      "That followed the return of American teacher Marc Fogel in February, after he spent 3\u00bd years in prison for a minor medical cannabis infraction. Going the other way in that exchange was convicted money launderer Alexander Vinnik.",
      "And that swap came after the massive deal in which four U.S. residents wrongly imprisoned in Russia \u2014 including journalist Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan \u2014 were released last August as part of a multinational prisoner exchange the likes of which had not been seen since the Cold War.",
      "The large and complex deal, cut among seven nations, involved 24 people, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens held in Russia, and eight Russians imprisoned in the U.S., Germany, Slovenia, Norway and Poland.",
      "The deal would mark the latest twist in the complicated relationship between Trump and Putin.",
      "The two have long shared an obvious rapport, meeting on multiple occasions and exchanging warm words during Trump's first term. But tensions have been mounting, with Trump seeking to end the war in Ukraine \u2014 something he promised to accomplish within the first 24 hours of his second term \u2014 and Russia resisting those efforts.",
      "With relations between the White House and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warming recently \u2014 a large critical minerals deal and praise for Trump from the Ukrainian leader helped smooth things over after the two leaders' extraordinary Oval Office showdown this year \u2014 Putin's star may have fallen in Washington.",
      "Trump on Sunday wrote on Truth Social that Putin \u201chas gone absolutely CRAZY!\u201d and is \u201cneedlessly killing a lot of people\u201d after Russia unleashed a massive aerial assault on Ukraine on Saturday with drones and missiles targeting more than 30 cities and villages.",
      "The attacks came even as Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange of hundreds of soldiers and civilians, in the largest such swap in the three-year war so far. The deal was agreed upon during talks in Istanbul earlier this month, but those talks failed to reach a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Trump, who has shifted U.S. policy direction from outright supporting Ukraine to considering Russia\u2019s account of the war, had warned he would tighten sanctions on Russia if a peace deal isn\u2019t reached. But he appeared to back off his warning last week when he declined to impose additional sanctions on Moscow for not agreeing to an immediate pause in fighting.",
      "The two are last known to have spoken last week, when they exchanged a call that didn\u2019t appear to bring Russia any closer to a ceasefire.",
      "European countries, however, aren\u2019t waiting around for U.S. direction or guarantees when it comes to the war.",
      "The European Union and Britain last week announced a new round of sanctions against Russia, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying on X that it was \u201ctime to intensify the pressure on Russia to bring about the ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Germany last week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II before he announced Tuesday that it will become Ukraine's last major Western ally to lift all range restrictions on weapons it sends to Kyiv for use inside Russia."
