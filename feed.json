    "story": [
      "Oscar contender \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d has been named the best French film of the year at the C\u00e9sars awards \u2014 France\u2019s equivalent of the Oscars",
      "PARIS -- Oscar contender \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" was named the best French film of the year at the C\u00e9sars awards \u2014 France's equivalent of the Oscars \u2014 and under-fire Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n, the star of Jacques Audiard\u2019s Mexico-set melodrama, made a rare public appearance.",
      "The musical is one of the most celebrated films of the year but has also been criticized for its depiction of Mexican culture and engulfed in controversy because of Gasc\u00f3n's previous social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.",
      "Although Gasc\u00f3n, who was nominated in the best actress category along with her co-star Zoe Salda\u00f1a, did not win a C\u00e9sar, the night in Paris was triumphal for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which swept seven trophies.",
      "Audiard, who previously condemned Gasc\u00f3n's comments, thanked his \u201cmarvelous team\u201d and his female actors.",
      "\u201cWhen I say my team it\u2019s not in the sense of ownership, but a declaration of love,\u201d he said. \"The same goes for the actresses. My darling Zoe, my darling Karla, Adriana (Paz) who is not here, Selena (Gomez) who is not here. I loved working with you, I love you.\u201d",
      "Old posts from Gascon\u2018s X account resurfaced in January, some going as far back as 2016, that took aim at Muslims\u2019 dress, language and culture in her native Spain. She also suggested that Islam be banned. And less than a month after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020, Gasc\u00f3n offered her assessment of Floyd \u2014 whose death prompted widespread reckoning with police brutality and racism \u2014 as a drug addict who \u201cvery few people ever cared\u201d for.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations. Audiard has condemned her comments.",
      "If it manages to steer through the backlash and go home the big winner at the Oscars on Sunday, it would hand Netflix its first best picture win. Gasc\u00f3n is the first openly trans actor nominated for best actress and a win would be even more historic, although her chances of taking the award home now appear very slim.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who has issued an apology for her old posts, attended the 50th anniversary of the C\u00e9sars ceremony presided over by Catherine Deneuve at the Olympia theater in Paris. She wore a black dress and posed for photographers but did not speak to reporters.",
      "Salda\u00f1a also made the dash to Paris before she takes to the Oscars carpet as the favorite to take the best supporting actress Oscar.",
      "In Paris, Gasc\u00f3n and Salda\u00f1a were nominated for the C\u00e9sar for best actress, but it was handed to French actor Hafsia Herzi for her performance in \u201cBorgo.\u201d Best actor went to Karim Leklou for his performance in \u201cLe Roman de Jim\u201d (Jim's Story).",
      "Julia Roberts was also in Paris on Friday to receive an honorary C\u00e9sar for her career achievements. She was called onto the stage by Clive Owen, with whom she starred in \u201cCloser\u201d and \u201cDuplicity,\u201d and was treated to a standing ovation."

      "An artist in Denmark is seeking to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that includes three piglets starving to death",
      "An artist in Denmark aims to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that opened Friday that includes three piglets who will be denied food and water and will starve to death.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that happens to thousands each day in the industry doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d she said. But she also praised the artist for asking \u201cthe large questions about who we are as human beings or want to be, and what we are doing to fellow creatures in the name of enormous amounts of mass-produced cheap meat.\u201d",
      "Damm explained that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, and leading to the starvation of many. She said some 25,000 piglets die every day from starvation or the result of the conditions in which they are held in Denmark.",
      "It's not Evaristti's first controversial project.",
      "One of his projects included goldfish in blenders, tempting viewers to press the button and create goldfish soup.",
      "In 2006 he used some of his own body fat removed via liposuction to prepare meatballs, and then ate some of them.",
      "He described that project called \u201cPolpette Al Grasso Di Marco\u201d as a critique on people overconsuming and then buying their way to slimness with liposuction, and at the same time an attempt to transcend the taboo of cannibalism.",

      "A depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children\u2019s television program",
      "BERLIN -- Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze: a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults.",
      "A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, \"Mist!\" (Think \u201ccrap!\u201d in English.)",
      "Played and voiced by puppeteer J\u00f6rg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can\u2019t wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper.",
      "This year, his friends \u2014 a sheep and a flower bush \u2014 are urging him to become a bread influencer.",
      "Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, creator Tommy Krappweis drew Bernd's infamous grimace after co-creator Norman C\u00f6ster's face when they were asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children\u2019s public television channel.",
      "Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf \u2014 white bread typically sliced for sandwiches \u2014 with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining and dry sense of humor and irony.",
      "Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more-optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush.",
      "Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time.",
      "The move brought an adult audience \u2014 often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying \u2014 into Bernd's world, cementing his popularity as a German cult classic.",
      "In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize \u2014 the German television equivalent of an Emmy \u2014 because the jury said he represents \u201cthe right to be in a bad mood.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t feel well sometimes. That\u2019s completely fine,\u201d Krappweis, Bernd's creator, said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary.",
      "Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort).",
      "But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart.",
      "\u201cA long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,\u201d Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. \u201cBut unfortunately it was in vain.",
      "\u201cShe only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.\u201d",
      "Despite Bernd\u2019s best efforts \u2014 one of his catchphrases is \u201cI would like to leave this show\u201d \u2014 the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he\u2019s been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like \u201cGive Us Our Daily Bernd.\u201d",
      "He was even kidnapped! In 2009, his 2-meter-tall (6.56 feet) statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based.",
      "A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd\u2019s kidnapping and the video was removed from the internet.",
      "Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks.",
      "KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary \u2014 despite his complaints \u2014 with new episodes, an update to his hit song and online activities for kids and adults alike. The celebrations begin now, as Bernd\u2019s birthday is Feb. 29.",
      "The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel \u201cBetter with Bernd\" in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer.",
      "The trio will present inventions to make school, and life, easier for viewers but naturally their concoctions backfire. Bernd instead becomes a defluencer \u2014 and an involuntary trendsetter.",

      "Marcelo Rubens Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d became a box-office success",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian author Marcelo Rubens Paiva happily swung his wheelchair from side to side, dancing with thousands of Carnival revelers there to celebrate him and his work. Seconds later, an unidentified man showed Paiva his middle finger, then threw a beer can and a backpack that hit him in the head.",
      "Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d became a box-office success. The film, a rare blockbuster in the South American nation, garnered three Oscar nominations ahead of the awards ceremony Sunday.",
      "While millions of Brazilians love the story for its long-overdue truth-telling about the country\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, others see it as left-wing propaganda. Paiva has been dismayed at the outpouring of hatred, mostly online, directed at him.",
      "\u201cIt is simply (our) history being told in the way we believe it must be told, the way our family lived it, so it never happens again,\u201d Paiva, 65, told The Associated Press in his Sao Paulo apartment. \u201cI assure you that some of those on the far-right or on the right have watched it and maybe changed their opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is up for best picture and best international feature, while Fernanda Torres, who portrayed Paiva's mother Eunice, is competing for best actress. The film centers on the disappearance of Rubens Paiva, the author's father, and Eunice's decadeslong quest to force authorities to confirm his death.",
      "Paiva, one of five siblings, has known success, but not as much controversy. His 1982 book \u201cHappy Old Year\u201d narrating his life before and after a diving accident put him in a wheelchair, sold more than 1.5 million copies. He is also an award-winning playwright, former TV talk show host and political activist.",
      "But he says nothing prepared him for the sudden impact \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d had since it won best screenplay at the Venice Film Festival. Many other awards followed since.",
      "\u201cThis is very different; it is more intense because of social networks,\" Paiva said. \u201cPeople (around the world) react in the same way to this movie, with the same emotion that Brazilians felt.\u201d",
      "After his book about his accident, he knew he still had another important story to tell.",
      "\u201cI was the son of a disappeared politician; few people knew what had happened during the dictatorship,\u201d he said.",
      "That was largely because Congress passed an amnesty law in 1979, as the dictatorship neared its end, sparing perpetrators of political crimes from prosecution.",
      "Cracks started to emerge in 2011 after then President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses. It was one of the seeds for Paiva's book and, later, the film.",
      "\u201cPeople were asking for reparations for families of missing politicians, they sued my father\u2019s torturers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military showed they were upset, because their colleagues and their fellow coup mongers were under fire. The accusations were being published, so they started to threaten Brazil\u2019s democracy. And little by little it was once again in doubt.\u201d",
      "Past ire toward the Paiva family has notably come from one man: Jair Bolsonaro, the former army captain who rode a wave of anti-establishment populism to his presidency (2019-2022).",
      "In 2014, then-lawmaker Bolsonaro spat on a statue of the late Paiva in Congress, accusing him and his family of being at the service of communist terrorists. His claims date to the 1990s and falsely link a farm the Paiva family owned, near where Bolsonaro grew up, to a guerrilla group.",
      "\u201cEvery year, he made a speech against my father, making up stories,\u201d Paiva said. \u201cOnce, he said my father had been killed by his comrades who were in the armed struggle, because he had revealed things during the torture sessions. It was the first time I heard anyone tell such an absurd story, with no evidence, and people believed it. It was the first time I saw the power of social media in creating a new narrative, a lie.\"",
      "Bolsonaro said in an interview Monday he hasn't seen the film, but his allies have railed against it, saying Paiva died in a war, as did many on both sides. Brazil\u2019s Truth Commission found that at least 434 people died at the hands of the military regime, including 136 who disappeared.",
      "Paiva published \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d as Alzheimer\u2019s disease washed away his mother\u2019s memory. Director Walter Salles bought the rights in 2017, but chose not to make the film during Bolsonaro's presidency. Last week, Brazil's prosecutor-general indicted Bolsonaro for allegedly staging a coup to remain in power. It included inciting a riot in capital Brasilia by encouraging his supporters to riot marking an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cPeople everywhere are afraid of watching their democracies become dictatorships,\" Paiva said. \"This movie glorifies democracy and the understanding that human rights, empathy are in short supply.\u201d",
      "Adding to Paiva's recent achievements since the film premiered, his father\u2019s death certificate, first obtained by his mother in 1996, was updated in January to go beyond mere confirmation to include: \u201cviolent death caused by the Brazilian State in the context of systematic persecution to the population identified as dissidents of the policies of the dictatorial regime installed in 1964.\u201d",
      "Brazil's Supreme Court said earlier this week it will rule whether the sole survivor among Rubens Paiva\u2019s torturers, Gen. Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Nogueira Belham, can be tried. Brazilian human rights activists have argued that concealing bodies is a continuous crime not covered by the country\u2019s amnesty law.",
      "\u201cI see literature as a mission, and I feel mine was accomplished,\" said Paiva. \u201cThe movie\u2019s mission is accomplished, even if it doesn\u2019t win any Oscars.\u201d",

      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d",
      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d His umbilical cable has severed. The support vessel above is aimlessly drifting away from the site through violent, stormy waters. And the diver has only ten minutes of oxygen in his backup tank.",
      "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s also a true story.",
      "If merely reading this is giving you heart palpitations already, you can only imagine the white-knuckle experience of watching this all play out on the big screen. It\u2019s 40ish minutes of pure suspense and anxiety as the story shuffles between the man at the bottom of the ocean, Chris Lemons (Finn Cole), his fellow saturation divers (Woody Harrelson as Duncan and Simu Liu as Dave) in the diving bell below the waters who are unable to help and the crew in the support vessel above (including Cliff Curtis and Mark Bonnar) scrambling to get their systems back online and operational as the clock rapidly runs out. Ten minutes has never felt so short \u2014 and then it just gets worse as the clock starts counting up, showing Chris\u2019s time without oxygen.",
      "At one point, Liu\u2019s character Dave, a no-nonsense, all-business diver says matter-of-factly at that it\u2019s a body recovery, not a rescue. Deep-sea saturation diving is a dangerous business, described at the start of the film as the most dangerous job on earth. Chris tells his fianc\u00e9, in a short introduction, that it\u2019s no more dangerous than going to space. She replies that it\u2019s funny that he thinks that is comforting.",
      "The real incident happened in September 2012 \u2014 Dave, Duncan and Chris were just one team of divers sent to the ocean floor off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, to repair oil pipeline.",
      "The seas were particularly rough that day, with winds up to 35 knots, common for the North Sea but also not what one might call safe. Chris and Dave were in the middle of their work when they heard the urgent calls to abort: The dynamic positioning system in the support vessel above had failed and they were in drift. Chris scrambled to maneuver out of the pipeline corridors, but his umbilical got caught. For a brief, awful moment he\u2019s the anchor to the ship above, but soon enough the cord snapped, and he was thrown back to the ocean floor in pitch black with no coms, no heat and very little hope for survival. News articles about the incident clock his backup oxygen supply as being closer to five or six minutes \u2013 perhaps the movie wanted to give the audience a little buffer.",
      "If this sounds at all familiar, it may be because it was made into a documentary, also called \u201cLast Breath\u201d and released in 2019. While it was well-received, some true stories are just too gripping to exist solely in that form. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that a narrative film was made as well. There\u2019s a good track record of recent complimentary adaptations \u2014 think Ron Howard\u2019s \u201c13 Lives\u201d and \u201cThe Rescue\u201d about the Thai boys soccer team stuck in the cave.",
      "This one was made by Alex Parkinson, the same director who co-directed the doc, and it\u2019s a well-executed narrative interpretation that doesn\u2019t get in its own way with padding. Harrelson gets to be the wise mentor who really doesn\u2019t want to lose someone on his last mission. Liu gets to flex his action muscles (literally and figuratively) in a modest but solid role. And they don't go out of their way to shoehorn in a villain \u2014 this is just a group of people trying their best to save a life.",
      "The only real problem, if one can even call it that, is that it\u2019s so short. The film doesn\u2019t take liberties with stretching out the timeline much at all and after 93 minutes, the whole thing is over. It feels strange to want a movie to be longer, but in the case of \u201cLast Breath\u201d I was both desperate for it to end, for anxiety reasons, and also wanting more.",
      "\u201cLast Breath,\u201d a Focus Features release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 Motion Picture Association for \u201cbrief strong language.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. Three stars out of four."

    "story": [
      "The Metropolitan Opera is staging a production of Herman Melville's masterpiece about a white whale, \u2018Moby-Dick",
      "When Leonard Foglia was invited to direct an opera based on Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece about a white whale, his first reaction was: \u201cMoby-Dick. That\u2019s great!\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I ran to a used bookstore and got the book,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I thought: \u2018Oh my God, what am I in for here?\u2019 It\u2019s so daunting. I didn\u2019t panic, but I thought, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "How he and his collaborators did it will be on display at the Metropolitan Opera beginning March 3. The opera is composed by Jake Heggie to a libretto crafted by Gene Scheer.",
      "To begin with, Scheer had to whittle a novel of more than 600 pages down to a 64-page libretto. He kept as much of Melville\u2019s language as possible, and estimates that 40% to 50% of his libretto can be found in the original text, though he often tweaked the phrasing to make it more singable.",
      "Heggie and his initial partner, Terrence McNally (who withdrew for health reasons), had already decided to lop off the opening chapters, which take place on land. They set the entire opera aboard the whale-hunting ship Pequod.",
      "Another crucial change was renaming the narrator, calling him Greenhorn to reflect his status as a novice aboard the ship. Now the book\u2019s famous opening line, \u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d is transposed to the very end of the opera when the character has matured.",
      "\u201cIn the novel, Ishmael is telling a story that happened many years ago,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut in the theater, you want to see it happen in real time. \u2026 We\u2019re watching him take in all the experiences so that when he says \u2018Call me Ishmael,\u2019 he\u2019s ready to write the book. In essence, this opera is the education of Ishmael.\u201d",
      "Tenor Stephen Costello, who is performing the role for the fifth time and is the lone cast holdover from the Dallas premiere in 2010, sees his character as \u201cthe only one who really has an arc.",
      "\u201cHe goes on the Pequod because there was nothing for him on land,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo he\u2019s either going to die at sea or figure out who he is.\u201d",
      "In addition to Costello, the Met cast includes tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the vengeance-obsessed Captain Ahab. Pip, his cabin boy, is written as a \u201ctrousers role\u201d (a male character portrayed by a woman) and will be sung by soprano Janai Brugger. Starbuck, the first mate, will be baritone Peter Mattei, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green will sing the part of Queequeg. Karen Kamensek conducts the eight performances through March 29.",
      "The opera, commissioned to celebrate the opening of a new opera house in Dallas, has been a success from the beginning, drawing praise from audiences and critics \u2014 and even scholars.",
      "Bob Wallace, a professor at Northern Kentucky University and past president of the Melville Society, admired the opera so much that he wrote a book about its creation.",
      "\u201cScheer and Heggie did a brilliant job of shrinking the novel to make it fit the stage and yet preserve so much of the essence of it,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "As much as critics admired Scheer\u2019s adaptation and Heggie\u2019s tuneful, atmospheric and at times gripping score, they lavished special praise on the physical production, with sets by Robert Brill and projections by Elaine J. McCarthy.",
      "The action, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cplayed out against a multimedia-enriched staging that ranged from striking to near-miraculous.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most stunning effect is the way animated projections superimposed on a climbing wall that is curved a bit like a skateboard ramp create the illusion of the crew leaving the Pequod to board three whaling boats.",
      "\u201cA lot of the excitement and thrill of watching this is due to the work of the production team,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cLenny kept saying to me, \u2019You imagine it the way you want it, and let me figure out how to do it.\u201d",
      "That often involved imposing unusual physical demands on the singers. For instance, when Pip gets lost at sea, his character sings the equivalent of an operatic mad scene dangling high above the stage, with projections making it appear he\u2019s treading water.",
      "\u201cI said to Janai when we first rehearsed it,\u201d Foglia recalled, \u201cOK, you can just get mad at me now, because you have to sing your hardest aria hanging from not even a full harness, just a single wire.\u201d",
      "In addition, Queequeg and Greenhorn climb up and down ladders to sing at the top of the mastheads. Ahab, who has lost a leg in a prior encounter with Moby-Dick, has to hobble on a wooden prosthesis. And Greenhorn \u2014 finally named Ishmael \u2014 ends the opera grabbing onto a whale hook from a passing ship that lifts him to safety.",
      "\u201cI joke with them that everything opera singers count on in life \u2014 having both feet planted on the ground \u2014 I\u2019ve taken away from them,\u201d Foglia said.",

      "Rossellini reappeared, gave a big hug to Fonda, and introduced her to the fourth \u201cConclave\u201d cast member in attendance, Sergio Castellitto, who played the vaping Cardinal Tedesco in the film.",

      "The wins for \u201cConclave\u201d and Chalamet threw a wrench into expectations for the Oscars that are just a week away, with Chalamet, Fiennes and Rossellini all nominees. The presumed Oscar frontrunner, \u201cAnora,\u201d was shut out.",

    "story": [
      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

But the team behind last year\u2019s show is \u201caiming for the stars\u201d once more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling the pressure,\u201d said Oscars executive producer and showrunner Raj Kapoor. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ones to rest on our laurels. We always want to push the envelope.\u201d",

      "Last year the Oscars made a moment out of what is usually just a list of names by inviting past Oscar acting winners to speak about each of the nominees before the winner was read.

It won\u2019t be the actors this time, but some of the other categories that \u201cmaybe don\u2019t normally get the spotlight on the Oscar stage,\u201d Mullan said.",

      "New York musician Larry Saltzman isn't really a movie fan, but he'll be sure to watch the Oscars this year",
      "NEW YORK -- He's not a movie buff, so New York musician Larry Saltzman doesn't always watch the Oscars. This year, however, he's got a rooting interest.",
      "Saltzman taught actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet how to play guitar for the role of Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d In turn, Chalamet earned a best actor nomination and the film is also up for best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday.",
      "A guitarist who's performed with Simon & Garfunkel, Bette Midler and David Johansen, as well as in the pit at Broadway productions \u201cHairspray\u201d and \u201cAin't Too Proud to Beg,\u201d Saltzman has developed a specialty in teaching actors how to play music for their roles. Besides Chalamet, recent pupils have included Adam Driver and Sadie Sink of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d",
      "On a fellow musician's recommendation, Saltzman first got a call from a movie studio about a decade ago. He admits to being cranky as discussions dragged on. \u201cI almost did everything to talk them out of hiring me,\u201d he said.",
      "Not until the fifth phone call did the studio identify the client: Meryl Streep.",
      "She needed to learn the electric guitar for her starring role in the 2015 film \u201cRicki and the Flash,\u201d where she portrayed an aging rocker trying to keep her career and life together in the wake of a series of disappointments.",
      "Working with Streep is a little like a political consultant's first client being elected president. If she likes you and word gets around, other students will follow. Teaching actors now represents about 40% of his business, the 69-year-old said.",
      "\u201cMy time spent with her was excellent,\u201d he said of Streep. \u201cShe's smart. She knows how to learn things. There was a steady progress over three or four months. She did very well.\u201d",
      "Faking it just won't do for serious actors and film directors. It's like lip-syncing \u2014 the audience is going to tell the difference, and the characters will be less believable. That was especially true with Chalamet, who needed to sing and play at the same time for a character whose artistry is the centerpiece of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen the actors come to you, they're kind of vulnerable,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThey want to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Saltzman had more than 50 sessions with Chalamet, starting in person and retreating to Zoom during the pandemic. It wasn't easy. Chalamet had to learn some 25 songs in the script.",
      "\u201cSometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID,\u201d Chalamet recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.\u201d",
      "It helped that Saltzman is a Dylan buff. Focusing on imparting \u201cthe guitar playing of \u2018pre-electric Bob,\u2019\u201d he taught his charge so well that Chalamet was a musical guest as well as host on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d performing obscure Dylan cuts last month. Saltzman says, in the course of their sessions, Chalamet \u201cwent the extra mile\u201d and unearthed \u201cvery early, obscure\u201d Dylan songs that weren't even in the script.",
      "Saltzman generally likes teaching actors more than common folk, in part because there's a specific goal: They need to learn certain songs to inhabit a particular character. When it's open-ended \u2014 someone just wants to learn the guitar \u2014 it can be more of a challenge, he said. Saltzman also believes that it's an advantage to not be a regular teacher, someone who may approach clients with a more rigid style.",
      "Actor Johnny Cannizzaro said he appreciated Saltzman's calming \u201cbedside manner\u201d and felt welcome in an apartment filled with guitars. Cannizzaro has the role of E Street Band member \u201cLittle Steven\u201d Van Zandt in the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic, \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was never really a moment where he expressed any sort of frustration or impatience with me during a session,\u201d said Cannizzaro, who has background playing keyboards but not guitar. \u201cIf anything, he would express some excitement when you grasped something he was teaching. That put me at ease.\u201d",
      "Saltzman also studied film of Van Zandt so he wasn't just teaching Cannizzaro guitar \u2014 he was showing specifics of how Van Zandt plays, the actor said.",
      "Beyond teaching, Saltzman's time is divided between studio work, playing in New York clubs accompanying different artists and Broadway \u2014 he's just about to begin \u201cSmash.\u201d",
      "It's an eye-opening experience for him to later see his students on screen. That was particularly the case when he saw \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and marveled at Chalamet's ability as an actor.",
      "All the more reason to watch the Oscars, and to take some pride in his own work.",
      "\u201cIn my own humble way, I'm a small gear in that machinery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is rewarding is knowing that in some small way I'm contributing to making a better film.\u201d",

      "A new album documents jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald in concert in Oakland, California, in 1967",
      "The setting is less grand than suggested by the title of a new Ella Fitzgerald album, \u201cThe Moment of Truth: Ella at the Coliseum.\u201d In this case, the coliseum is not in Rome or Los Angeles, but the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena in Oakland, California.",
      "Jazz giant Fitzgerald\u2019s presence elevated any event, however, and that was the case on June 30, 1967, when she performed at a concert that also included The Duke Ellington Orchestra and other luminaries.",
      "\u201cThe Moment of Truth\u201d documents Fitzgerald\u2019s set, and her incomparable alto is in typically fine form. She bounces and glides, blares and coos, bellows and whoops and scats and swings to the audience\u2019s delight. \u201cIf you love her, clap!\u201d someone shouts.",
      "The album, which will be released Friday, features performances of nine songs unearthed from the private tape collection of Verve Records founder Norman Granz. The vinyl release offers outstanding sound quality and extensive, informative liner notes by the critic Will Friedwald. He notes that while it was unusual for Fitzgerald to sing contemporary pop tunes, the set includes her only known performance of two classics from the mid-1960s \u2014 the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned \"Alfie\u201d and Bob Crewe's \u201cMusic to Watch Girls By.\u201d",
      "Fitzgerald is accompanied by a piano trio, and on several songs by the Ellington orchestra, with whom she had a lengthy 1960s collaboration. Ellington doesn\u2019t play, however, and the understated arrangements leave the spotlight entirely to Fitzgerald. She\u2019s in a playful mood in her on stage banter, teasing a late arrival, impersonating Louis Armstrong, and ruling out a striptease.",
      "Her singing is radiant as she turns sophisticated melodies into a thrill ride. Their direction is as unpredictable as a pinball, with rhythmic daring and inventiveness that could make an arena sway. And it probably did.",
      "Fitzgerald flies high on \u201cMack the Knife,\u201d and displays jazzy verve on Benny Goodman\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Way\u201d and the Tony Bennett staple \u201cThe Moment of Truth,\u201d while \u201cYou\u2019ve Changed\u201d shimmers with bluesy beauty. On \u201cLet\u2019s Do It (Let\u2019s Fall in Love),\u201d her phrasing is as clever as Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics. In her version, she injects references to the Beatles,James Bond, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "As Friedwald notes, Fitzgerald rarely drew from the Burt Bacharach-Hal David catalogue. But her interpretation of their classic ballad \u201cAlfie\u201d is a marvel of technique, emotional investment and creativity, including a brief digression. Fitzgerald navigates the complicated melody and rhythm with ease. It's an exemplar of the album, because as always, in keeping with the advice of the lyrics, her heart leads the way.",

      "The protest album features recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, to show what they fear will be the fate of creative venues if the plan goes through. The titles of the 12 tracks spell out: \u201cThe British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.\u201d",
      "Profits will be donated to the musicians\u2019 charity Help Musicians.",

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a heatproof bowl and reserve. Lower the heat to medium-low, then stir the flour into the oil that remains in the pot and cook, stirring frequently, just until the mixture, or roux, smells toasty, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, scallions, celery, bell pepper and bay leaves, season lightly with salt and black pepper, and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot frequently, until the onions are translucent, 12\u201314 minutes.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A nurse who survived an armed man\u2019s attack on an intensive care unit in a Pennsylvania hospital said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that she was held against him as a shield at gunpoint, arms zip-tied behind her back, as they walked through a doorway and encountered a phalanx of responding police officers.",
      "Nurse Tosha Trostle wrote that she had begged the attacker to let her go and that he pushed the gun against her neck and spine. When they encountered police, she prayed as she heard gunshots and smelled smoke, then heard bullet casings hitting the floor, she wrote.",
      "\u201cI eventually fell into the floor under the weight of the shooter\u2019s body. The officers told me to run. I struggled to get out from under him,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI remember his limp cold hand against my face as I pushed away with my feet.\u201d",
      "She fell twice trying to get to her feet before an officer guided her into another room.",
      "Phone and Facebook messages were left for Trostle on Wednesday. A nurse from the hospital who didn\u2019t want to be identified by name because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the events confirmed the posting was from Trostle\u2019s Facebook account.",
      "Authorities say Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, brought a gun and zip ties to UPMC Memorial Hospital in York on Saturday morning and was holding hostages when responding officers fatally shot him.",
      "West York Patrolman Andrew Duarte, 30, was shot and killed. Two other officers and three hospital employees were wounded, authorities said.",
      "Trostle recounted that she had been drawing blood when she heard a commotion and went into a hallway.",
      "\u201cAfter all I thought I was responding to a staff assist, patient fall, one in a dozen possible occurrences; not an active shooter. When I rounded the corner of the back hall I was met in the distance by the shooter holding my coworker, Jess, at gunpoint,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Her colleague, Jessica Breighner, was forced to zip-tie her.",
      "\u201cI saw the fear in her eyes, fear does not sound like enough really though,\u201d Trostle wrote.",
      "The attacker\u2019s shoes became etched into Trostle\u2019s mind as she lay at his feet, thinking the gun might have jammed and then hearing him reload, she added.",
      "\u201cSo many things happened I cannot recount step by step,\" she wrote, \"but how I remember those red sneakers.\"",
      "Jason Huff, Breighner\u2019s partner of more than 20 years, also described the incident in a separate Facebook post on Wednesday that said the attacker had pulled the trigger three times with the gun against Breighner\u2019s head, but it was apparently out of ammunition.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when she knew it was time to take her shot,\u201d Huff wrote. \u201cShe broke her zip ties while he reloaded and ran -- thank God.\u201d",
      "Huff told The Associated Press she hopes to talk publicly about it later, with the others who survived the attack.",
      "Huff wrote on Facebook that before fleeing, Breighner had to \u201clisten to this criminal call and warn someone to clean out the apartment and get the jewelry because he\u2019s not coming home and was ready to die.\u201d",
      "York County District Attorney Tim Barker said Saturday that Archangel-Ortiz appeared to have had recent contact with the intensive care unit \u201cfor a medical purpose involving another person\u201d but declined to elaborate.",
      "Asked about the nurses\u2019 accounts, a UPMC spokesperson said the health system prioritizes safety and privacy but referred questions to law enforcement.",
      "Trostle said the attacker \u201chauled me off the floor pushing me into the adjacent wall,\u201d where Breighner's photo was among pictures of the group\u2019s leadership on the wall.",
      "\u201cPushing the gun into my neck and spine. I begged to go home to my children. He petted my head and promised I would that I was doing everything right,\u201d Trostle wrote.",
      "She said he directed her to take him to the floor where the most people were. As they went through a doorway, they encountered what she called \u201ca wall of armed officers aimed at us.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, she was led down a stairway. In the days since, the memory has haunted Trostle and her family, she said.",
      "\u201cMy physical injuries do not even compare fractionally to what injuries are unseen,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI live with immense sadness and guilt of all who responded, their mental and physical injuries. Especially, brave Officer Andrew Duarte that gave his life to bring us home.\u201d",

      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan has reported two new cases of polio in its southern and eastern provinces, health officials said on Friday, posing a setback to the country\u2019s efforts to eradicate a disease that remains endemic only in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan.",
      "The latest cases, confirmed by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program, were detected in Sindh and Punjab provinces. This brings the total number of polio cases in Pakistan to five since January 2025. In 2024, Pakistan recorded 74 polio cases.",
      "The latest development comes as health workers conclude a targeted vaccination drive in high-risk areas later Friday. Earlier this month, authorities launched a weeklong nationwide anti-polio campaign aiming to immunize 44.2 million children under the age of five.",
      "Escorted by police, polio teams go door-to-door to administer the oral vaccine, though they are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks."

      "Measles cases in the United States last year were nearly double the total for all of 2023, raising concerns about the preventable, once-common childhood virus. Health officials confirmed measles cases in at least 18 states in 2024, including in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.",
      "\"Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control say on their website.",
      "Here's a brief look at the global measles situation.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles in 2023 and 107,500 died. Most were unvaccinated people or children younger than five. Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",
      "Global health organizations and other groups have increased their efforts to speed up immunization programs and close the gaps in prevention."

      "A bill that would strip gender identity protections from Iowa\u2019s civil rights code has received final legislative approval and now goes to the governor",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",

      "EL PASO, Texas -- On the Texas border, Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth.",
      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",
      "The other accused doctors \u2014 both in Dallas \u2014 are under temporary court orders not to see patients and only practice medicine in research and academic settings.",
      "\u201cLooking at the patients was hard because they were kind of disappointed of what was going on,\u201d Granados said of ending their care. \u201cBut it was something that needed to be followed because it\u2019s the law.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",
      "Granados is one of two pediatric endocrinologists in El Paso, a desert city of about 700,000 where mountains rise in the distance.",
      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",

      "A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims",
      "VANNES, France -- A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.",
      "He does not deny the allegations, though says he doesn't remember everything. Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to prison terms ranging from three to 20 years.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations have called for a rally on Monday in front of the courthouse where Le Scouarnec will be tried.",
      "The case began in 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor said Le Scouarnec had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "He had admitted to child abuse dating to 1985-1986, but some cases could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine alleged rapes and other abuses committed between 1989 and 2014 against 158 men and 141 women who were aged 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to investigation documents.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the post-operation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital when she was 9 years old in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot.\"",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,\u201d she told public broadcaster France 3. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression. ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper his client will \u201canswer the judges\u2019 questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year.",
      "Some child protection groups joined the proceedings as civil parties, saying they hope to toughen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn\u2019t allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral",
      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades, and said the lack of fluoride showed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d have a patient come in without cavities or anything else like that, and I\u2019d say, \u2019You didn\u2019t grow up here. Where did you grow up?' ... because everybody here has lots of cavities!\u201d he said.",

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in planned contract cuts following concerns that the move would hurt critical veterans' health services, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday.",
      "The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals, whose cancellation would save $2 billion as the Trump administration works to slash costs across the federal government.",
      "\u201cNo more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!\u201d Collins posted to X Tuesday, in a post that was then lauded by Elon Musk, President Donald Trump's cost-cutting chief at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 affected contracts, which shows the cuts would affect everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The list underscores how the Trump administration\u2019s approach to broad spending reductions has immediate and potentially unintended consequences, generating significant concern not just among Democrats but also Republican lawmakers.",
      "The VA said in a statement to the AP that its review of the contracts \u201cis ongoing and not final.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement.",
      "One contract that was on the chopping block supports assessing veterans' disability ratings. Those evaluations are one of the most important steps needed for a veteran to qualify to have their medical care covered and receive financial compensation if they were wounded due to their military service. An inaccurate rating can have a long-term impact on their access to care and financial support.",
      "Another contract is intended to identify and integrate data between the Pentagon, VA and other agencies to support the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, a bill passed in 2022 to increase veterans\u2019 access to care.",
      "Some of the other contracts marked for cancellation also directly affect veterans' care.",
      "At a joint House and Senate hearing Wednesday with veterans services organizations, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal submitted a partial list of the affected contracts his office had received and submitted it for the congressional record.",
      "If carried out, these cuts \u201cwill harm veterans and taxpayers for years to come,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement.",
      "In an internal VA email sent Tuesday and seen by the AP, a VA contracting official said DOGE targeted contracts broadly categorized as \u201cconsulting\u201d but they included ones that if terminated would halt chemotherapy and imaging services.",
      "Contracts to calibrate radiation detection equipment, to support cancer care and veterans cemetery management, among others were also targeted. Another would directly affect the ability to assess toxic exposure because it supports more than 24,000 research requests to look through the National Archives and Records Administration and other government sources to validate service and toxic exposure events.",
      "Former VA Secretary David Shulkin, who served in the Trump administration in his first term, said that while the agency has gotten larger and there are likely savings to be found, the VA grew, in part, to meet the large expansion of veterans enrolling to get care under the PACT Act. More than 740,000 veterans signed up for coverage after the law passed, according to a September 2024 VA press release.",
      "\u201cI do think slowing down and pausing to see what the consequences are, even if they are unintended consequences, is important to do,\u201d Shulkin told The Associated Press.",
      "Veterans service organizations called for \u201dimmediate transparency\u201d on what contracts were affected.",
      "\u201cWith funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services,\u201d said Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360.",
      "The group advocates for veterans who face life-altering respiratory illnesses and cancers due to toxic exposure to dangerous air particle matter generated from massive trash-burning fires at overseas bases.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- An annual United Nations conference on biodiversity that ran out of time last year will resume its work Tuesday in Rome with money at the top of the agenda.",
      "That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far \u2014 and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth.",
      "The talks in Colombia known as COP16 yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature \u2014 say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants \u2014 to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters.",
      "But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done.",
      "The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework.",
      "\u201cMontreal was about the \u2018what\u2019 \u2014 what are we all working towards together?\u201d said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. \u201cCali was supposed to focus on the \u2018how\u2019 \u2014 putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,\u201d said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks \u201cAnd so now we\u2019re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.\u201d",
      "The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Qu\u00e9bec, Spain, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Participants will discuss establishing a \u201cglobal financing instrument for biodiversity\u201d intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money.",
      "Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really about how do we collect the money and how do we get it distributed fairly, get it to the ground where it\u2019s needed most, so that that\u2019s really the core issue,\u201d said Kruger.",
      "Oscar Soria, chief executive of The Common Initiative, a think tank specializing in global economic and environmental policy, was pessimistic about raising a great deal more money.",
      "\u201cWe are completely off track in terms of achieving that money,\u201d Soria said. Key sources of biodiversity finance are shrinking or disappearing, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat was supposed to be a good Colombian telenovela in which people will actually bring the right resources, and the happy ending of bringing their money, could actually end up being a tragic Italian opera, where no one actually agrees to anything and everyone loses,\u201d Soria said.",
      "Susana Muhamad, Colombia's former environment minister and the COP16 president, said she's hopeful of \u201ca good message from Rome.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat message is that still, even with a very fragmented geopolitical landscape, with a world increasingly in conflict, we can still get an agreement on some fundamental issues,\" Muhamad said in a statement. \"And one of the most important is the need to protect life in this crisis of climate change and biodiversity.\u201d",
      "Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to an October report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London.",
      "\u201cBiodiversity is basically essential to our livelihoods and well-being,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to the the air we breathe, the water we drink, rainfall that food systems rely on, protecting us from increasing temperatures and increasing storm occurrences as well.\u201d",
      "Chandler said deforestation in the Amazon has far-reaching impacts across South America, just as it does in the Congo Basin and other major biodiverse regions worldwide.",
      "\u201cWe know that has an impact on rainfall, on food systems, on soil integrity in other countries. So it\u2019s not just something that\u2019s kind of small and isolated. It's a widespread problem,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d starring Natalie Morales and Sonequa Martin-Green, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow",
      "Even for a film titled \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d the opening scenes of Kyle Hausmann-Stoke\u2019s movie have a startling rhythm.",
      "First, two female American soldiers are riding in a Humvee in Afghanistan 2016 blasting Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella.\u201d They are clearly friends, and more concerned with the music coming through loudly than enemy fire. Merit (Natalie Morales) tells Zoe (Sonequa Martin-Green) that they ever set foot in \u201csome dopy group therapy,\" to please kill her.",
      "Cut to years later, they\u2019re sitting in a counseling meeting for veterans and Morales\u2019 character has a sour look at her face. She turns to her friend: \u201cDid we survive the dumbest war of all time just to sit here all broken and kumbaya and ouchie-my-feelings?\u201d",
      "But after this rush of cavalier soldiering and bitter sarcasm comes a sobering moment. Merit blinks her eyes and is instead staring at an empty chair. Zoe isn\u2019t there at all.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d co-starring Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow. It comes from a real place, and you can tell. Hausmann-Stoke is himself a veteran and \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is dedicated to a pair of his platoon mates who committed suicide. The opening titles note the film was \u201cinspired by a true story.\u201d",
      "Audience disinterest has characterized many, though not all, of the films about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the output has pretty much dried up over the years. \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d feels like it was made with an awareness of that trend and as a rebuke to it.",
      "This is an often breezy and funny movie for what, on paper, is a difficult and dark story. But the comic tone of \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is, itself, a spirited rejection to not just the heaviness of many films about veterans but of the grief that can consume those who have dealt with loss and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Throughout the film, Zoe appears only to Merit, ala Brad Pitt in \u201cFight Club,\u201d singing alongside her as she drives or impatiently waiting for Merit to come home from a run. Whether this, following some unspecified end to Zoe, is a healthy thing or not for Merit is increasingly in doubt. Merit needs to cling to her friend, or her memory of her. But Zoe also rolls her eyes at any suggestion of talking through her feelings. Zoe, as an apparition, is both the cause and relief to her pain.",
      "There are a few other points of view, courtesy of two of our finest actors. Freeman plays the counselor of Merit\u2019s mandatory group sessions. He refuses to let Zoe coast. To pressure her to share and participate, he threatens withholding Zoe's certification.",
      "Meanwhile, Merit\u2019s grandfather, Dale (Harris), a Vietnam vet, has just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s. Merit is tasked with keeping an eye on him at his rural lakeside cabin and helping him into a retirement community \u2014 a prospect that infuriates him. As Merit\u2019s original inspiration for joining the army, Dale \u2014 stubborn and tight-lipped \u2014 epitomizes an earlier generation of soldier.",
      "In toggling between the present and wartime flashbacks, \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is sometimes a bumpy ride. The interplay between Merit and Zoe also shifts, beginning more like a buddy comedy and veering toward horror-film haunting, especially when Merit hesitantly agrees to a date with a worker at the prospective retirement home (Utkarsh Ambudkar).",
      "But the movie\u2019s earnestness carries it through these less smooth moments. So does the cast. Any opportunity to see Freeman or Harris, still at the top of their games, is a chance to be treasured. Freeman is typically sage and Harris characteristically fiery. But the leads are even better. Morales is at her finest as a cynical soldier, devoted to her friend but little else. And with compelling poise, Martin-Green (\"The Walking Dead\") carries a movie that at times can feel scattershot but never not sincere.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 101 minutes. Three stars out of four."

He\u2019s going to be in charge of the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Momo\u2019s tenure is symbolic of society being turned upside down during Carnival. His role is inspired by Greek mythology. Momus is the personification of satire, mockery and irreverence."

      "ROME -- Pope Francis was resting Saturday after an alarming setback in his two-week recovery from double pneumonia: Doctors had to put him on noninvasive mechanical ventilation following a coughing fit in which he inhaled vomit that needed to then be extracted.",
      "Doctors said it would take a day or two to evaluate how and if the episode impacted Francis\u2019 overall clinical condition. His prognosis remained guarded, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger.",
      "In its brief morning update Saturday, the Vatican said: \u201cThe night has passed quietly, the pope is resting.\"",
      "In the late Friday update, the Vatican said the 88-year-old suffered an \u201cisolated crisis of bronchial spasm,\u201d a coughing fit in which Francis inhaled vomit, that resulted in a \u201csudden worsening of the respiratory picture.\u201d Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on non-invasive mechanical ventilation.",
      "The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the maneuvers to help him recover. He responded well, with a good level of oxygen exchange and was continuing to wear a mask to receive supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said.",
      "The episode, which occurred in the early afternoon, marked a setback in what had been two successive days of increasingly upbeat reports from doctors treating Francis at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "The Vatican said the episode was different to the prolonged respiratory crisis on Feb. 22, in that it was an isolated spasm that resulted in Francis aspirating the vomit that he produced.",
      "Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episode as relayed by the Vatican was alarming and underscored Francis\u2019 fragility and that his condition \u201ccan turn very quickly.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think this is extremely concerning, given the fact that the pope has been in the hospital now for over two weeks, and now he\u2019s continuing to have these respiratory events and now had this aspiration event that is requiring even higher levels of support,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cSo given his age and his fragile state and his previous lung resection, this is very concerning,\u201d added Coleman, who is not involved in Francis\u2019 care.",
      "Dr. William Feldman, a pulmonary specialist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, said it was a good sign that the pope remained alert and oriented during the episode, but concurred that it marked \u201ca worrying turn.\u201d",
      "\u201cOften we will use noninvasive ventilation as a way of trying to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation,\u201d Feldman said.",
      "Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient\u2019s blood gas levels improve so they can eventually go back to using oxygen alone.",
      "Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in \u201ccritical condition,\u201d which has been absent from their statements for three days now. But they say he isn\u2019t out of danger, given the complexity of his case.",
      "Late on Friday, Francis\u2019 closest friend in the Vatican bureaucracy, Argentine Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, led the nightly prayer in St. Peter\u2019s Square to pray for Francis\u2019 health.",
      "With other cardinals bundled against the night chill, Fern\u00e1ndez urged the crowd to pray not just for Francis but for others, as the pope himself would.",
      "\u201cCertainly it is close to the Holy Father\u2019s heart that our prayer is not only for him, but also for all those who in this particular dramatic and suffering moment of the world bear the hard burden of war, of sickness, of poverty,\u201d said Fern\u00e1ndez, the Vatican\u2019s doctrine chief.",
      "Also Friday, the Vatican published a document signed by Francis on Feb. 26 \u201cFrom the Gemelli Polyclinic,\u201d a new official tagline that showed Francis was still working from the hospital.",

      "A momentous ceasefire declaration has stirred a mix of emotions in southeast Turkey and northern Iraq, where people bore the brunt of the 40-year conflict between Kurdish militants and the Turkish state",
      "DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- A momentous ceasefire declaration on Saturday stirred a mix of emotions in southeast Turkey and northern Iraq, where people bore the brunt of the 40-year conflict between Kurdish militants and the Turkish state.",
      "The militants' ceasefire announcement could mark a significant boost to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government, two days after their imprisoned leader called for the group to disarm.",
      "On the streets of Diyarbakir, the largest city in Turkey\u2019s Kurdish-majority southeast, some of those who had lost relatives fighting on the side of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, were wary of placing their faith in the Turkish government. Turkey has yet to make a detailed response to the PKK's ceasefire announcement.",
      "\u201cWe do not trust them, they said the same things before, nothing has changed. Twelve years ago they said peace, peace, peace. Then there was a ceasefire and then we saw what happened,\u201d said Turkan Duman, 56, referring to a previous peace process that broke down in 2015.",
      "She said her son is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for PKK membership. He was jailed after crossing the Syrian border to fight with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State group at Kobani in late 2014.",
      "Duman also lost two brothers who were killed fighting Turkish security forces in the mid-2010s near Lice, a town to the north of Diyarbakir where the PKK was founded in 1978.",
      "Kiymet Soresoglu, who like Duman is part of the Peace Mothers\u2019 Association, also expressed doubt over the government\u2019s intentions. \u201cOf course we want peace to be established. We are afraid because they make plans or (could) play a trick,\u201d she said.",
      "Soresoglu, 55, also has a son serving a prison term for being a member of the PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "He was wounded in fighting in Diyarbakir\u2019s downtown Sur district when the earlier ceasefire broke down 10 years ago. \u201cThere is not a single inch of land left in Kurdistan where the blood of martyrs has not been shed,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIf they tell us to lay down our weapons without expecting anything in return, we, the guerrillas and mothers of martyrs, will not accept this. We would be the ones that would take the weapons of our children and continue the struggle.\u201d",
      "Sitting alongside her friend, Duman added: \u201cBut we want peace. Peace so that no more blood is shed, it is a sin.\u201d",
      "Since the PKK launched its armed campaign against the Turkish state in 1984, tens of thousands have died. Exact casualties are difficult to calculate but the International Crisis Group says 7,152 have been killed since fighting resumed in July 2015, including 646 civilians, 1,494 members of the security forces and 4,786 PKK militants.",
      "Saturday\u2019s ceasefire announcement was preceeded two days earlier by imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan\u2019s call for the group to disarm and disband.",
      "Vahap Coskun, a law lecturer at Diyarbakir\u2019s Dicle University, said this indicated how closely the PKK leadership based in northern Iraq was in step with Ocalan despite his 25 years behind bars.",
      "\u201cA very high threshold has been crossed in terms of disarmament,\u201d he said, adding that he expected the PKK to move swiftly to hold a congress to dissolve itself.",
      "\u201cUnlike the last solution process, this solution process is being handled with utmost sensitivity regarding the use of time,\u201d Coskun added.",
      "Across the mountainous Iraqi border, which for years saw PKK insurgents slip into Turkey to stage attacks, Kurds in Sulaymaniyah welcomed the ceasefire with hopeful expectation.",
      "Najmadin Bahaadin described it as a \u201chistorical moment\u201d different from previous peace deals.",
      "\u201cIt is not like the previous experiments where the PKK stopped the war several times and demanded peace but (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan and Turkish policy were not convinced,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems they both reached to this conviction now.\u201d",
      "Sulaymaniyah, in northern Iraq\u2019s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, is the city closest to the PKK\u2019s headquarters in the Qandil mountains and many locals support the group.",
      "Awat Rashid questioned whether Ocalan had been pressured by his captors to make the peace bid.",
      "\u201cIf Mr. Ocalan was in the Qandil mountains, on top of his leadership council, would he make this peace decision? This is the question that should be asked,\u201d he said. \u201cTo what extent you think this is reliable and it can be trusted?\u201d",

      "Shortly after the announcement, mosques flooded with devotees offering evening prayers known as \u201ctarawih\u201d on the first eve of Ramadan. In Jakarta\u2019s Istiqlal Grand Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, tens of thousands of worshippers crammed together shoulder-to-shoulder.",
      "The fasting is aimed at bringing the faithful closer to God and reminding them of the suffering of the poor. Muslims are expected to strictly observe daily prayers and engage in heightened religious contemplation. They are also urged to refrain from gossip, fighting or cursing during the holy month.",
      "Samsul Anwar, his wife and their 8-year-old nephew were among hundreds of people taking part in a torchlight parade along the streets of their neighborhood in Tangerang, a city just outside the capital of Jakarta, on Wednesday after evening prayers.",
      "They carried torches, lit flares and played Islamic songs accompanied by the beat of rebana, the Arabic handheld percussion instrument, as they walked along the cramped streets of the densely populated neighborhood.",
      "\u201cEvery year we welcome Ramadan with a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation,\u201d said Anwar.",

      "President Irfaan Ali, in a televised address, said Guyana was hurriedly notifying all of its international allies, including the Trump administration, and had summoned Venezuela's ambassador in the capital, Georgetown, to lodge a formal protest.",
      "\u201cThis incursion is a matter of grave concern,\u201d Ali said. \u201cGuyana\u2019s maritime boundaries are recognized under international law. This is a serious development concerning our nation\u2019s maritime territory. We will not tolerate threats to territorial integrity.\u201d",

      "VATICAN CITY -- There has long been a Vatican taboo against openly talking about a conclave when a pope is sick: It\u2019s considered gauche to speculate about the election of a new pope while the current one is fighting for his life. And that is certainly true as Pope Francis battles double pneumonia at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital.",
      "But the surprising success of \u201cConclave\u201d the film and momentum going into Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards have thrust the arcane rules, glorious ceremony and supreme drama of one of the Catholic Church\u2019s most solemn moments into popular culture, and put the Catholic hierarchy in something of a bind as it simultaneously prays for Francis.",
      "The film can\u2019t be dismissed as distasteful or blasphemous, since it treats the gravity of a papal election with respect and accurately portrays the ancient rituals and contemporary problems facing today\u2019s Catholic Church. Both the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano and the Avvenire daily of the Italian bishops conference gave \u201cConclave\u201d rave reviews.",
      "Granted, those reviews were published before Francis entered the hospital Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection that has taken him out of commission for the longest time of his 12-year papacy.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the newspapers would have published them after Francis\u2019 health took such a dire turn. That's even more the case since it's clear from the opening scenes in the Vatican's modern Santa Marta hotel where Francis lives that \u201cConclave's\u201d fictional dead pope is modeled after the real-life current one.",
      "But at the very least, the life-imitating-art coincidence of \u201cConclave\u201d the movie finding mass popular appeal at a time when the world's media has descended on Rome to monitor Francis' health has certainly piqued interest in what might happen in a real-life conclave.",
      "\u201cConclave,\u201d director Edward Berger\u2019s adaptation of the Robert Harris novel starring Ralph Fiennes as the dean of the College of Cardinals, has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It goes into Sunday\u2019s Oscars with a Bafta win for best picture and a SAG award for best ensemble.",
      "Harris is well aware of the sensitivity of the moment, and how the surreal turn of events of an ailing pope dovetailing with an Oscar campaign had made his book and the film relevant to say the least. But he is adamant against trying to milk the moment for publicity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been refusing all requests to talk about it and a future conclave because I think that\u2019s in extreme bad taste,\u201d Harris told The Associated Press. \u201cI really hope he\u2019s got some more years yet.\u201d",
      "Francis suffered a setback on Friday, after he inhaled vomit during a coughing fit and required non-invasive mechanical ventilation to breathe. Doctors said they need 24 to 48 hours to evaluate how and if the isolated episode affected his overall clinical condition, while keeping his prognosis guarded.",
      "All of which has made \u201cConclave\u201d the film a bit too close for comfort in more ways than one for anyone following Francis' plight and concerned about what it means for the Catholic Church.",
      "To recap: The film opens with the death of the pope and turns around the political maneuvering and manipulations behind the election of his successor. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Fiennes) is dean of the College of Cardinals, who must organize the conclave amid his own crisis of faith.",
      "With the future of the church weighing on him, he has to contend with secrets, scandals, smear campaigns and surprising twists, while ensuring the election's integrity.",
      "Massimo Faggioli, theologian at Villanova University, said the film was \u201csadly effective\u201d in illustrating the institutional instability that the Catholic Church is going through now, as well as the ease with which a single act or allegation of misconduct can ruin someone.",
      "\u201cThe main threats (are) now coming not from the outside (Napoleon, or Hitler, or secularization), but from the inside (especially the fear of another sexual scandal),\u201d he said.",
      "For sure Berger takes some creative liberties. Cardinal Lawrence, for example, would have been excommunicated two or possibly three times for his efforts to navigate the intrigue, given the ban on communications with the outside world during a conclave and canon laws governing the seal of the confessional and the sealing of the papal apartments after a pope has died.",
      "But this is Hollywood, and His Eminence can be forgiven.",
      "Avvenire, which hews to the Vatican establishment line, praised the film for its sumptuous beauty, twists of plot and \u201canything but trivial\u201d commentary about the current state of the church.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s face it: \u2018Conclave,\u2019 which takes us to the heart of one of the world\u2019s most mysterious and secret events, is a highly entertaining film, especially for an American audience that isn\u2019t terribly picky,\u201d Avvenire said on Dec. 20, when the film opened in Italian theaters and well before Francis got sick.",
      "Writing in the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano on Feb. 1, critic Alessandra Comazzi highlighted the short but critical turn played by Isabella Rossellini, as Sister Agnes.",
      "As a longtime critic for the La Stampa daily, Comazzi is well aware of the Vatican taboo of openly talking of a conclave. But in an interview, she said the film managed to treat a conclave as thriller without causing offense. She said the Vatican newspaper was only too happy to publish her rave.",
      "\u201cThe dean Lawrence has to govern the conclave and liberate it from these false prophets,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think also from the ecclesial and religious point of view, the director managed to do it in a very respectful way.\u201d",
      "That said, someone who has actually participated in a conclave gave the film something of a thumbs down.",
      "\u201cMy experience of being in at least one conclave was not that it was some sort of scene of political backroom plotting of how to get your candidate elected,\u201d Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the retired archbishop of Boston, wrote in a Feb. 7 blog post.",
      "O\u2019Malley voted in the 2013 conclave that elected Francis pope and is one of his closest allies. He said he and his brother cardinals were well aware that millions of Catholics were praying from afar \u201cso that the Holy Spirit would guide us in our deliberations.\"",
      "\u201cAnd, of course, at the moment when each cardinal votes, you take your ballot, stand in front of Michelangelo\u2019s image of Christ in the \u2018Last Judgment\u2019 and swear before God that you are going to vote for the person that you believe is God\u2019s will for the church,\" he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a much different experience than what they depicted in the movie,\" he wrote. \"For all its artistic and entertainment value, I don\u2019t think the movie is a good portrayal of the spiritual reality of what a conclave is.\u201d",

      "CAIRO -- The latest round of talks on the second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has made no progress so far, and it was unclear whether the talks would resume on Saturday, a senior Hamas official said.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Phase one expires on Saturday, but under the terms of the deal, fighting is not to resume while negotiations are underway on the second phase, which could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining living hostages returned home.",

      "Hamas did not attend the talks, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, told The Associated Press there had been \u201cno progress\u201d on finding a solution before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday.",
      "It was unclear whether those mediators were going to return to Cairo to resume talks on Saturday as has been expected, and Naim said he had \u201cno idea\u201d when negotiations might start again.",
      "Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7 2023 attack that left 1,200 dead in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say that more than half the dead have been women and children.",
      "The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January, with the aim of bringing an end to the war.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said that it \u201creaffirms its full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details\u201d and called on the international community to pressure Israel to \u201cimmediately proceed to the second phase without any delay or evasion.\u201d",
      "In addition to phase two of the ceasefire, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that mediators in the talks were \u201calso discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region.\u201d",
      "Hamas has rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire\u2019s first phase by 42 days, saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "The Israeli proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started on Saturday, in return for an additional hostage exchange, the Hamas member said.",
      "The U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, said in a post on social media on Saturday that it reached 1 million Palestinians across Gaza during the deal\u2019s first phase.",
      "The pause in fighting helped \u201crestoring distribution points, reopening bakeries, and expanding cash assistance,\u201d the agency said.",

      "Inspired by both the late German neoexpressionist dancer Pina Bausch\u2019s work and lifestyle, the collection previewed Saturday during Milan Fashion Week featured soft cashmere knitted into form-hugging long sheer dresses or bodysuit-and-legging combos, worn with playful furry flip flops.",
      "Shearling fur accented jackets and became panels on sheer dresses in a game of conceal and reveal. A big black faux fur was finished with a pair of glossy black leather bags belted at the hip. Leather and satin were draped to create new shapes in skirts and blouses.",
      "Menswear was strong on everyday looks, including monochrome cashmere suiting, argyle sweaters paired with leather trousers and weekend bags, and a fun fur zipped bomber.",
      "The collection of mostly neutral tones included pops of Ferragamo red as accents like gloves or almond-toe pumps but more dramatically as a feathery dress with a matching handbag, or a fringe-covered sheer number incorporating long-stem trailing poppies.",

      "The owners of an island volcano in New Zealand where 22 tourists and local guides died in an eruption had their criminal conviction for failing to keep visitors safe overturned by a judge on Friday",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The owners of an island volcano in New Zealand where 22 tourists and local guides died in an eruption had their criminal conviction for failing to keep visitors safe thrown out by a judge on Friday.",
      "The release of the decision followed a three-day hearing last October for the owners\u2019 company at the High Court in the city of Auckland where they appealed the charges laid by New Zealand's workplace health and safety regulator following the 2019 eruption of Whakaari, also known as White Island.",
      "The company, Whakaari Management \u2014 run by three brothers who own the active volcano on New Zealand's North Island \u2014 was ordered in March 2024 to pay millions of dollars in fines and restitutions to the victims of the eruption, who were mostly U.S. and Australian cruise ship passengers on a walking tour.",
      "Lawyers for the company filed an appeal against the criminal conviction the same month.",
      "The case hinged on whether Whakaari Management \u2014 which granted access to the volcano to tourists and scientific groups, collecting fees for permits \u2014 should have been in charge of safety at the volcano site under New Zealand\u2019s workplace health and safety laws. Anyone in charge of a workplace must ensure management of hazards and the safety of all there, including at entry and exit points.",
      "Survivors told the trial in emotional testimony during the company's 2023 trial that they had not been told the active volcano was dangerous when they paid to visit it. They were not supplied with protective equipment, and many were wearing clothing that made their horrific burns more damaging.",
      "In Friday's written ruling, Justice Simon Moore ruled the company did not have a duty under the relevant law to ensure that the walking tour workplace was without risks to health and safety. He agreed with the company's lawyers that the firm only granted access to the bare land to tourism business \u2014 and should not have been legally considered the entity that managed or controlled the workplace.",
      "The case had far-reaching implications and has already changed the laws governing New Zealand\u2019s adventure tourism industry, which is often based around outdoor thrills on or around the country\u2019s many natural hazards. Operators must now take all reasonable steps to inform customers of any serious risks.",
      "The lawyers for the company said during last October's hearing that if the conviction was allowed to stand, it would make other land owners reluctant to allow such activities to take place on their property \u2014 a suggestion rejected by the regulator."

      "An international border fence may soon split the village of Longwa in two",
      "LONGWA, India -- To the people who live there, Longwa is a typical hilltop village. The most imposing structure is a corrugated tin roof belonging to the Angh, a hereditary tribal chief.",
      "But recently, residents have been worried about another, less visible, local landmark: the border between India and Myanmar, which runs right through the village's center.",
      "National boundaries never mattered before to the local Konyak tribe. \u201cI eat in Myanmar and sleep in India,\u201d says Tonyei Phawang, the Angh, whose house sits on the border.",
      "The Indian government is now seeking to stop border crossings for the first time, revoking a system that made it legal for Indigenous people to cross freely and threatening to build a border fence that could cut villages like Longwa in two.",
      "On a Thursday in December, Longwa's marketplace was bustling with shoppers from the Myanmar side, motorbikes loaded with as much salt, flour, biscuits, clothes, milk, tea, soap as they could carry. The nearest town with a market on the other side of the border is Lahe, a full day\u2019s drive away.",
      "Locals have long come and gone to shop, study or seek medical care, with no sign that they're crossing an international border except a border marker sitting on a hilltop in the village. The Angh and village council members say their forefathers had no idea that the concrete pillar was meant to divide them when it was built in the early 1970s.",
      "\u201cAt that time we had no idea this is India or Myanmar. It was a free land. There was nobody who understood English or Hindi. They understood nothing,\u201d Phawang says.",
      "Like dozens of other Indigenous Naga tribes, the Konyak\u2019s land straddles the mountains that divide India and Myanmar. Naga villages are usually built on hilltops for security, something that wasn't considered when the British East India Company drew the border in an agreement with the then-Kingdom of Burma.",
      "The Constitution of India does not allow dual citizenship, but people in Longwa see themselves as belonging to both countries.",
      "\u201cI am from both India and Burma,\u201d Phawang said, using another name for the country officially known as Myanmar. \u201cI vote in the Burmese election. And when the Indian election comes I vote there too.\u201d",
      "Phawang is chief of six Konyak villages in India and more than 30 in Myanmar, whose residents pay allegiance with a yearly feast as they have for some 10 generations.",
      "The reach of the Indian state was very limited in these borderlands until recently. People here often have documents from both governments, said Khriezo Yhome, a senior fellow and editor at Asian Confluence, a think tank working to create an understanding of eastern South Asian. \u201cHowever, there was practically no way for the state to do anything to check it.\u201d",
      "Until recently, residents from both sides could travel legally within 16 kilometers (9.9 miles) of the border, but that started to change in February 2024, when the government revoked the Free Movement Regime \u201cto ensure the internal security of the country and to maintain the demographic structure of India\u2019s North Eastern states bordering Myanmar.\u201d",
      "Change has come slowly in Longwa: it took almost a year before soldiers stationed in the village began checking documents, and Longwa residents still move freely after their shifts end in the early afternoon. But people from other villages in Myanmar are afraid to travel beyond Longwa to reach schools or medical care, said B. Phohi Konyak, a former local leader of an organization representing Konyak women.",
      "Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said the government has decided to construct a fence along the entire 1,643-kilometer (1,021-mile) long Indo-Myanmar border.",
      "If it follows the legal border, it would have to cut through dozens of houses. Of the 990 buildings in the village, 170 lie on the boundary line \u2014 including a government school, the church and an army camp.",
      "Wangron Konyak, 23, drove five hours on his motorcycle from the village of Momkho to pick up his sister as school closed for vacation. \u201cIf we are not allowed to come this side then we will suffer a lot. For those studying in Myanmar school it will be alright, but people like my sister who study in India will be very affected.\u201d",
      "Residents and state officials are rejecting the changes.",
      "The Nagaland state government passed a resolution opposing the end of the Free Movement Regime and plans for border fencing, and on Feb. 3 Longwa residents staged a protest carrying placards with slogans like \u201cRespect Indigenous rights, not colonial legacy!\u201d",
      "Yhome, the expert, said that an effort to stop locals from crossing the border could violate the U.N. Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People, which seeks to protect the integrity of border-straddling communities.",
      "\u201cFor us there is no Burma Longwa or India Longwa,\" Yanlang, a 45-year-old village council member. \"How can one village and one family be divided?\u201d asked"

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a zoo to improve the health of an African elephant named Ely, the first time the country\u2019s highest court has made such a move in favor of an animal.",
      "The court ordered that there be \u201ca constant improvement of her health and physical condition.\u201d",
      "The decision by a panel of four justices upheld a lower court\u2019s order last year in Ely\u2019s favor and experts believe it could set a precedent in Mexico recognizing that animals have rights.",
      "Advocates have argued that Ely suffered from depression, especially since the death of Maggie, the other elephant sharing her habitat, in 2016, as well as illnesses she suffered in captivity. Ely would bang against the walls of her enclosure and lost weight. Her defenders called her \u201cthe world\u2019s saddest elephant.\u201d",
      "That was when Diana Valencia, founder and director of the animal rights group Opening Cages and Opening Minds, met Ely. \u201cIt really moved me to see the state that she was in, it tore my soul and I made Ely a promise,\u201d Valencia said, who has continued to visit the elephant regularly over the years. She told Ely, \u201c'They aren't going to do the same to you.'\u201d",
      "Ely, who estimated to be between 43 and 45 years old, has lived at the San Juan de Aragon zoo in Mexico City for 13 years since being rescued from a circus.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s ruling follows another high court decision last month when it determined that Mexico City laws against animal mistreatment and cruelty were constitutional.",
      "Valencia conceded that the zoo had improved Ely\u2019s living conditions, but only after public pressure.",
      "The zoo expanded the elephant enclosure and added two more elephants in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Veterinarian Gabriela Uribe Acosta, director of zoo, said she was confident the zoo could fully comply with the court\u2019s order to improve Ely\u2019s life.",
      "She said a team of six people are responsible for keeping her enclosure of more than 78,000 square feet clean and another half dozen people are monitoring her health.",
      "Uribe Acosta dismissed assertions that Ely is depressed. She said the elephant was stable and had improved since the other elephants were added. She moves around more and has new vocalizations.",
      "She said that when Ely arrived in 2012, after years in a circus, she had a problem with her rear right leg that limited her mobility, as well as nutritional deficiencies resulting from a poor diet.",
      "But Wednesday\u2019s order could reverberate beyond Ely. Lawyer Sergio M\u00e9ndez Silva, litigation coordinator for the local Foundation for Justice, said \u201cMexico is taking a significant step with a precedent like this and I believe this will mark a before and after.\u201d",
      "Still, Valencia plans to continue fighting for all three of the zoo's elephants to be moved to a sanctuary in Brazil or the United States. \u201cI can't be satisfied because an elephant can't live in captivity, it hurts them mentally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's one of the animals that most suffers in captivity.\u201d",

      "The 88-year-old pope once again slept well during the night at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital, had breakfast and resumed his therapy Thursday morning in good spirits, the Vatican said. The results of more medical tests were expected later Thursday.",
      "Doctors on Wednesday reported further slight improvements in his clinical condition as his hospital stay neared the two-week mark on Friday. They said the kidney insufficiency that had been detected in recent days had receded, blood tests showed a slight improvement and a chest CT scan showed that his complex lung infection was taking the \u201cnormal evolution\u201d as it is being treated.",
      "The prognosis remained guarded, however. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, is still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen and respiratory physiotherapy to help his lungs expel fluid. But he hasn\u2019t had any more respiratory crises since Saturday, the Vatican said.",
      "Nevertheless, his near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican cancelled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. Longer term, Ash Wednesday loomed on the horizon March 5, the start of the church's Lenten season leading up to Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20.",
      "In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he has had to cut back his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.",
      "Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, as an inspiring role model for today's young Catholics.",
      "Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity's first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in what is today's Iznik, Turkey to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn't confirmed the trip.",
      "Prayers for his heath continued to pour in from near and far, with a group of Mexican pilgrims in Rome for the Holy Year taking a detour to pray for Francis outside the Gemelli hospital.",
      "Lili Iparea Fernandez, from La Cruz, Mexico, had come to Rome with plans to attend Francis' Wednesday general audience this week, but it was cancelled.",
      "\u201cHowever, we firmly believe that the pope will recover because he is a very strong man,\u201d she said Thursday outside Gemelli. \u201cSo I invite everyone to believe firmly, with certainty, with confidence, with hope that the pope is going to be well.\u201d",
      "The dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, presided Wednesday night over what has now become a nightly appointment in St. Peter\u2019s Square, the 9 p.m. Rosary prayer.",
      "As is now popularly known thanks to the Oscar-nominated film \u201cConclave,\u201d the 91-year-old Re would have a key role in any papal death or conclave, called to preside over the funeral and organize the secret balloting in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope. Francis recently extended Re\u2019s term, keeping him on in the important job rather than naming someone new.",
      "But on Wednesday night, Re was merely one of the Catholic Church\u2019s most senior cardinals, an important point of reference for the men who lead the church, praying for Francis\u2019 speedy recovery.",
      "By now a certain rhythm appears to have emerged from the Vatican\u2019s updates: The pope receives treatments in the morning, including respiratory physiotherapy, and resumes work in the afternoon from his hospital room.",
      "The Vatican said Wednesday that he had appointed four new bishops and approved the creation of a new fundraising initiative to encourage donations to the Holy See, which has been enduring a financial crisis for years.",
      "Francis likely approved the bishop appointments a while back and the new norms for the fundraising entity were approved Feb. 11, before he was hospitalized. But the announcements made them official and suggested Francis was still very much in charge and governing.",

      "A Tunisian national has been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in France for the murders of three people in October 2020 in an attack linked to Islamic extremism",
      "LYON, France -- A Tunisian national was sentenced late Wednesday to life imprisonment without parole, France\u2019s most severe sentence possible, over the killing of three people in a basilica in the French Riviera city of Nice in 2020, one of multiple attacks that year linked to Islamic extremism.",
      "Brahim Aouissaoui, 25, was charged with terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder. He admitted responsibility for the attack during the trial in Paris, even though he had said he couldn\u2019t remember anything since then. He explained that he wanted to avenge Muslims killed around the world by Western nations.",
      "On Oct. 29, 2020, Aouissaoui killed worshippers Nadine Vincent, 60, and Simone Barreto, a 44-year-old French-Brazilian woman, and church worker Vincent Loqu\u00e8s, 55. Police officers fired at him as he lunged at them, shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is great) and wielding a knife. He was shot and seriously wounded.",
      "The attack was the third in less than two months that French authorities attributed to Islamic extremists, and prompted the government to raise its security alert to the maximum level. It came while France was holding a trial over the 2015 attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which published caricatures of Islam\u2019s prophet. France at the time faced anger from many Muslims around the world for defending the cartoons and for its policies against Islamic radicalism.",
      "France remains on high alert today, notably for domestic extremist threats stoked on online platforms."

      "Versace waved to the crowd at the end of the co-ed Fall-Winter 2025-26 runway show, maintaining silence even as other Italian fashion companies have expressed interest in the fashion empire founded in 1978 by her late brother, Gianni Versace.",
      "The show unfurled on a long runway in Milan\u2019s cavernous tram depot. Guests \u2014 including Ice Spice \u2014 were provided heated seats and warm blankets against the winter chill. Fittingly, the first looks employed thick quilted puffers in a mix of animal and Medusa prints as a wrap, a coiled mini-skirt, and a couture-like gown.",
      "The stiletto-heeled models walked with unusual high-stepping vigor, perhaps against the drafty venue, or perhaps to project energy to prospective buyers.",
      "Versace is at her best when projecting sex appeal \u2014 and there was that aplenty. Satiny teddies were belted and worn under black business blazers, or beneath a roomy ribbed turtleneck.",
      "Silken dress shirts in archival prints were worn with a leg-baring black ruched skirt for her, and black leather trousers for him. Both finished with studded black gloves.",
      "Built-in corsets were shaped like ice cream cones, colorfully contrasting in primary colors against black garments. They were worn with flouncy skirts and thick-soled boots, or a business trouser and pumps for the unabashed business woman.",
      "Chainmail dresses for her and shirts for him appeared battleworn, with metal mesh and crystal mesh patchworked as if mended and remended. The looks were paired with fierce, spiked caps fastened at the chin.",
      "The story Versace told this fashion week was one of resistance and perseverance. On the runway, nothing projected more power than a straight black trouser with a backless bodysuit, accented simply with a silver belt and chunky bracelets."

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus\u2019 law enforcement authorities failed to live up to their obligation to thoroughly and effectively investigate a British teenager\u2019s claims that she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis while on a 2019 vacation in a popular resort town, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday.",
      "In its ruling released Thursday, the court placed particular weight on the failure of the authorities to determine whether the woman \u2014 who was 18 at the time of the alleged rape \u2014 had ever consented to having sex with some of the suspects.",
      "According to the ruling, the woman had told authorities she rejected the suggestion of having sex with multiple partners. However, the suspects persisted in entering the hotel room where the alleged rape took place, disregarding her pleas for them to leave.",
      "Even though the woman was having sex with an Israeli friend of the suspects in that hotel room at the time, the court said investigators didn\u2019t establish whether the suspects had secured her consent. According to testimony, some of them only assumed they would because of her previous behavior.",
      "The court said investigators appeared not to take into account the woman\u2019s capacity to consent in light of testimony that she had consumed alcohol prior to the alleged rape and that traces of cocaine were found in her urine.",
      "Moreover, police and investigators took the suspects\u2019 statements that no rape had taken place \u201cat face value\u201d despite testimony that her Israeli partner \u201csaid he would arrange for his friends to have sex\u201d with her.",
      "This compounded what the court described as a series of flaws investigators in the initial state of the investigation, from a limited search of physical evidence such as fingerprints in the hotel room to failure to track down potential suspects or witnesses.",
      "\u201cThe Court observes that the present case reveals certain biases concerning women in Cyprus which impeded the effective protection of the applicant\u2019s rights as a victim of gender-based violence and which, if not reversed, run the risk of creating a background of impunity, discouraging victims\u2019 trust in the criminal justice system, despite the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework,\u201d the ruling said.",
      "The July, 2019 case made headlines in Cyprus, Britain and Israel when all 12 suspects were released without charge after the woman retracted her rape claims. The Cyprus attorney-general opted not to pursue legal proceedings against the suspects, while the woman was subsequently found guilty on a charge of public mischief and sentenced to a four-month suspended jail term.",
      "In the lower court ruling, the judge said the woman didn\u2019t tell the truth and tried to deceive the court with \u201cevasive\u201d statements. He said the woman had admitted to investigators that she made up the claims because she was \u201cashamed\u201d after finding out that some of the Israelis had videoed her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend on their cellphones.",
      "In 2022, the Cyprus Supreme Court overturned the woman\u2019s conviction, citing among other reasons that she didn\u2019t have a lawyer present when police repeatedly questioned her and that the lower court misconstrued evidence, prejudicing proceedings against her.",
      "The ECHR ruling said given the conditions of the woman\u2019s questioning by police, \u201cthere is force in her argument\u201d that the \u201clong and repeated interviews\u201d prompted her to retract her rape allegations.",
      "Justice Abroad Director Michael Polak, who represented the woman both in Cyprus and at the ECHR, called the ruling a \u201clandmark decision for victims of sexual violence.\"",
      "\u201cThis ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of sexual violence must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction,\u201d he said."

      "The U.K. government has provided provisional approval to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government gave its provisional backing Thursday to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London if certain improvements were met, including on noise reduction \u2014 a move that has been met with incredulity from environmental campaigners.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a written statement that she was \"minded to approve\u201d the expansion, which would involve moderately moving Gatwick's northern standby runway used for planes to taxi or as a backup.",
      "The original Gatwick project, which was rejected but then revised by planning inspectors, means that the final approval may be delayed by nine months.",
      "Under the new plan, Gatwick will have to ensure at least 50% of passengers traveling to and from the airport do so by public transport and take steps to mitigate noise.",
      "Gatwick, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of London and serves more than 40 million passengers a year, is the country's busiest single-runway airport, and second-busiest overall behind London's Heathrow Airport.",
      "Under the plan, Gatwick will have to move the current emergency runway 12 meters (39 feet) north away from the main runway in order to meet international safety standards. That would allow it to be used for departures of narrow-bodied planes such as Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s.",
      "The project, which will be funded privately, is expected to cost 2.2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion), could be completed by the end of the decade, if construction begins later this year.",
      "The expansion would allow it to cater for another 100,000 flights a year, taking capacity up to more than 380,000. It's projected to create 14,000 new jobs and generate 1 billion pounds ($1.26 billion) in annual economic benefits to the country.",
      "Gatwick, which is majority-owned by France-based VINCI Airports, has until April 24 to formally respond to the new proposals, while Alexander is expected to make a final decision shortly after that date, although a deadline has been extended to Oct. 27.",
      "Gatwick CEO Stewart Wingate welcomed Thursday's announcement, saying that the airport will \u201cengage fully\u201d in the extended process for a final decision.",
      "\u201cBy increasing resilience and capacity, we can support the U.K.\u2019s position as a leader in global connectivity and deliver substantial trade and economic growth in (southeast England) and more broadly,\u201d he said.",
      "Climate change activists, however, have railed against the new Labour government's provisional thumbs-up, which came just a few weeks after it gave its full backing to the construction of a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport, the country's busiest, as part of its drive to bolster the U.K.'s anemic economic growth over recent years. The government has made airport expansion a central plank of its growth plan.",
      "\u201cSuch a decision would be one that smacks of desperation, completely ignoring the solid evidence that increasing air travel won\u2019t drive economic growth,\u201d said Greenpeace U.K.\u2019s policy director, Doug Parr. \u201cThe only thing it\u2019s set to boost is air pollution, noise and climate emissions.\u201d"

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source.",
      "That is not what many scientists and climate activists envisioned in the fight against climate change. And it is endangering progress on the greenhouse gas-reduction goals that scientists say are necessary to manage the damage from burning fossil fuels that warms the planet.",
      "Across the nation, tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking new power projects to feed their energy-hungry operations.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is building climate-friendlier projects like solar, wind, geothermal or battery storage.",
      "But industry decision-makers are also turning to natural gas for what they say is a cheap and reliable source of power, raising the prospect that gas-fired power will play a bigger role \u2014 and for a longer period of time \u2014 than even they had anticipated.",
      "\u201cGas is growing faster now and in the medium term than ever before,\u201d said Corianna Mah, a power and renewables analyst at data analytics firm Enverus.",
      "Before the spike in electricity demand last year, many in the industry had assumed that there would be few new gas plants and that the nation's fleet would gradually retire in favor of a grid powered by wind, solar, geothermal, batteries and possibly the next generation of nuclear power \u2014 sources that don't emit the planet-warming greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.",
      "For many countries, that ramp down is happening as they work toward the goal of slashing their emissions to zero \u2014 or at least, net zero \u2014 by 2050, which scientists say could help the world avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., the electric power sector is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to government figures. And the construction of every new natural gas plant \u2014 built to last for decades \u2014 is a setback for climate goals, said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.",
      "\u201cAt a top level, we will not get to net zero by 2050 if we are building new gas plants. Period,\u201d Quigley said.",
      "Burning natural gas emits carbon dioxide, and before that, when it escapes from wellheads or pipelines in its unburned form, it's an even more potent greenhouse gas called methane.",
      "Quigley and others say there is enough solar, wind and battery storage projects on the drawing board to satisfy growing electricity demand. But, they say, utilities and grid operators lack the will to abandon natural gas.",
      "Enverus now projects the next five years will bring roughly 46 gigawatts of gas-fired power online. That compares to 39 gigawatts in the past five years, it said.",
      "Announcements last year alone include:",
      "\u2014 two 705-megawatt plants by Evergy in Kansas;",
      "\u2014 Entergy's 2,300-megawatt plant to serve Meta\u2019s $10 billion AI data center in northern Louisiana, a pair of new plants in Texas and another in Mississippi;",
      "\u2014 a 1,450-megawatt plant by the Tennessee Valley Authority;",
      "\u2014 a 1,400 megawatt Duke Energy project in North Carolina;",
      "\u2014 and Georgia Power's plans for three oil or gas units with a capacity of up to 1,300 megawatts.",
      "And that\u2019s not all.",
      "Calpine said it's exploring new gas-fired capacity in the congested mid-Atlantic region, especially Pennsylvania and Ohio, where analysts say the grid operator is trying to fast-track new gas-fired power plants into service.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the former Homer City coal-fired power plant is being transformed into a massive gas-fired station that's expected to supply a data center \u2014 and got a $5 million state grant to do it.",
      "On top of the artificial intelligence boom, the frenzy for new electricity is fueled by cryptomining, the broader electrification of society and a bipartisan push to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "It is coinciding with the closure of coal plants and aging nuclear plants, unable to compete with cheaper gas, solar and wind.",
      "Across the U.S., gas pipeline operators are exuberant about the new demand and are reporting strong interest in extending their lines.",
      "Chris Kalnin, the CEO of BKV, the largest natural-gas producer in the Barnett Shale gas reservoir in Texas, said the trend there is toward gas plants being built next to data centers in a booming data center corridor in metropolitan Dallas.",
      "Data center developers there are in an \u201carms race\u201d to secure power, Kalnin said.",
      "\u201cData center guys are trying to source power and trying to get to market with their data centers as fast as possible,\" Kalnin said. The key to signing up cloud-computing customers \"is getting your facility online quickly and getting your facility online quickly requires you to have power and dependable power and a cost-efficient power source.\u201d",
      "Rob Jennings of the American Petroleum Institute, said the sudden growth in actual and forecast electricity demand has put a premium on power sources that can be built fast and cheaply and are reliable.",
      "That means natural gas is once again attractive to investors over solar and wind, he said.",
      "\u201cIn the near term, the reality has dawned on most that it has to be gas,\u201d Jennings said.",
      "Industry officials say they strive to deliver electricity that is clean, reliable and affordable.",
      "For instance, some new gas plants are replacing higher-pollution coal-fired plants, some are designed to run only at times of high demand, some are paired with battery storage or a wind farm nearby and some are designed with carbon-capture technology or to run on a hydrogen blend, said Alex Bond of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents U.S. investor-owned electric companies.",
      "At the very least, building gas-fired capacity will have high-level political support.",
      "In his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, President Donald Trump declared that he'd issue \u201cemergency declarations\u201d to get coal - and gas-plants built to make the U.S. a superpower of manufacturing, cryptomining and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Amanda Levin of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the U.S. must take big steps by 2035 to reduce its reliance on gas.",
      "That means slashing a fleet of roughly 1,500 gas plants down to about 100 if the U.S. is to meet strong climate commitments and preserve a chance of addressing climate change, she said.",
      "Still, she said there are reasons to be optimistic that gas plant projects on the drawing board won\u2019t get built.",
      "In recent weeks, Chinese tech startup Deepseek released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies and at a fraction of the cost \u2014 calling into question the need for a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers.",
      "And some analysts believe utilities overestimate the electricity they\u2019ll need, essentially by double- or triple-counting data center proposals when firms express interest in multiple locations \u2014 but only build in one.",
      "Besides, Levin said, data center operators are getting better at energy efficiency, particularly in how they cool their servers.",
      "Even if all the gas plants are built, they may not get used, she said.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of reasons,\u201d Levin said, \"for why we might not actually see all of this (demand) materialize.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump says he plans to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting next Tuesday, in addition to doubling the 10% universal tariff charged on imports from China",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he plans to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting next Tuesday, in addition to doubling the 10% universal tariff charged on imports from China.",
      "Posting on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump said that illicit drugs such as fentanyl are being smuggled into the United States at \u201cunacceptable levels\" and that import taxes would force other countries to crackdown on the trafficking.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\u201d the Republican president wrote. \u201cChina will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date.\u201d",
      "The prospect of escalating tariffs has already thrown the global economy into turmoil \u2014 with consumers expressing fears about inflation worsening and the auto sector possibly suffering if America's two largest trading partners in Canada and Mexico are slapped with taxes.",
      "The potential for higher prices and slower growth could create political blowback for Trump, who promised voters in last year's presidential election that he could quickly lower the inflation rate, which jumped during President Joe Biden's term. But Trump also campaigned on imposing broad tariffs and sweeping tariffs, which he plans to launch on April 2 by resetting tariffs to match the taxes that he determines are charged by other countries on American goods.",
      "\u201cThe April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect,\u201d Trump said as part of his Thursday social media post.",
      "Trump indicated Wednesday that European countries would face a 25% tariff. He also wants separate tariffs on autos, computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs that would be levied in addition to the reciprocal tariffs."

    "story": [
      "Vietnam is revising its energy plans to focus more on large solar farms and less on reliance on coal and natural gas",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam is revising its energy plans to focus more on large solar farms and less on reliance on coal and natural gas. The fast-growing economy now aims to get 16% of its energy from the sun \u2014 more than triple its earlier target of just 5%.",
      "A draft of the new policy outline, likely to be finalized in coming weeks, scraps plans to build offshore wind turbines, instead building more onshore wind capacity, rooftop solar and energy storage.",
      "Offshore wind and new gas projects have proven expensive and difficult. Large solar farms are cheaper and easier to build.",
      "But Vietnam also is emphasizing expansion of large solar farms to meet soaring demand for power generation. It forecasts it will need more than 211 gigawatts of energy by 2030 as its economy grows, 40% more than its previous estimate and more than Germany's current total capacity.",
      "\u201cThis reflects both an overall increase in potential power demand by 2030 and the fact that LNG (or liquefied natural gas) projects are not on track to be completed by 2030,\u201d said Giles Cooper, a partner at the international law firm Allens based in Hanoi who specializes in energy policy.",
      "Solar power expanded rapidly in Vietnam from 2018 to 2020, helped by generous government policies, as it leaped past its neighbors and some richer nations like the United Kingdom. But construction of new solar capacity stalled in 2020 as the Southeast Asian nation realized that its creaky electricity grid was getting overloaded since electricity was only available when the sun shone.",
      "\u201cIt was like the market almost stopped,\u201d said Dimitri Pescia, of Berlin-based thinktank Agora Energiewende.",
      "Use of polluting coal, which releases earth-warming gases into the atmosphere, has surged and Vietnam is set to become of the world's top five coal importers, displacing Taiwan, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Like many other countries, Vietnam still needs to upgrade its rickety grid, which has failed to keep up with rapid growth of clean power generation. However, it has made improvements and gained experience dealing with energy sources that aren\u2019t always availables, Cooper said.",
      "Last year, authorities allowed electricity-guzzling factories to buy power directly from energy producers, aiming to ease pressure on the overstrained power grid and help big manufacturers like Samsung Electronics meet their climate targets. But that was hindered by a lack of space to build clean energy projects close to factories.",
      "Solar energy is \u201cseen as the most promising technology to kick start\u201d those direct purchases, Cooper said.",
      "But while it's building clean power capacity, Vietnam is also ramping up use of coal. That's partly to make up for lost hydropower capacity due to drought, and also to meet soaring demand as businesses shift factories from China to Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam is Southeast Asia's second-biggest coal producer after Indonesia. It also imported 50 million ton of coal in the first three quarters of 2024 \u2014 a 31% increase, according to government data.",
      "Pescia noted that Vietnam\u2019s coal-fired power plants aren\u2019t very old and operators have yet to recoup their investments.",
      "\u201cPhasing out coal in a country like Vietnam will take more time,\u201d he said.",

      "Firefighters said that 15 of the 17 tanks in the train were on fire. Each tank contained about 60 metric tons (66 tons) of the toxic substance. They used a helicopter to contain the fire while their counterparts from neighboring Slovakia were on the way to help.",

      "The Indonesians were among more than 7,000 people being held in the Myanmar border town Myawaddy following a crackdown on the scam centers by Thailand, Myanmar and China. Two buses carrying the Indonesians arrived Thursday in the Thai border city of Mae Sot, where the passengers had health checks and their identities were verified.",

      "The crackdown on the scam centers in Myanmar followed a meeting in Beijing in early February between Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and Chinese leader Xi Jinping where she said Thailand would crack down on the scam networks.",
      "Thailand has cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar hosting scam centers along the border.",
      "More than 600 Chinese nationals were repatriated last week. Earlier, some 260 people from 20 countries, including Ethiopia, Brazil and the Philippines, crossed from Myanmar into Thai custody. Many have returned home but more than 100 remain in Thailand awaiting repatriation, Thai officials said.",
      "The size and scale of the repatriation effort is straining Thai government resources and leading to delays for those waiting to go home. Officials from Thailand, Myanmar and China were expected to meet Friday to address the logistics of the crackdown as concerns grow about a possible humanitarian crisis along the border.",

Construction of the second fab should be done in 2031 and operations should begin in 2032.",
      "Intel announced the project in January 2022 and broke ground eight months later at the site in Licking County, just northeast of Columbus. The first plant initially was due to begin operating in 2025, but the project has since been delayed by financial concerns, the departure of its CEO last December and other problems. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",

      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal Party will choose a new leader March 9, congratulated Ford on his victory.",

      "Opposition parties accuse Ford of calling an early election before any potential charges emerge from a police investigation into his now-scrapped plan to develop lands under environmental protection.",

    "story": [
      "Congress sent to President Donald Trump's desk a repeal of a fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas production",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled Congress has voted to repeal a federal fee on oil and gas producers who release high levels of methane, undoing a major piece of former President Joe Biden's climate policy aimed at controlling the planet-warming \u201csuper pollutant.\" The fee, which had not gone into effect, was expected to bring in billions of dollars.",
      "The Senate on Thursday voted along party lines 52-47 to repeal the fee, following a similar House vote on Wednesday. The measure now goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.",
      "Methane is a much stronger global warming gas than carbon dioxide, especially in the short term, and is to blame for about one-third of the world\u2019s warming so far. Oil and gas producers are among the biggest U.S. methane emitters and controlling it is critical to address climate change.",
      "Most major oil and gas companies do not release enough methane to trigger the fee, which is $900 per ton, an amount that would increase to $1,500 by 2026. The measure was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but the Environmental Protection Agency didn\u2019t formally set rules until late last year.",
      "That timing made it vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to pass a resolution to undo rules that are finalized towards the end of a president's term. If those resolutions pass and the president signs them, the rule is terminated and agencies can\u2019t issue a similar one again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sorry testament to the influence of Big Oil on Capitol Hill that one of the top priorities of Congress is a blatant handout to the worst actors in the fossil fuel industry,\" said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen\u2019s energy program.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, the largest lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, applauded the move, calling the fee a \u201cduplicative, punitive tax on American energy production that stifles innovation.\"",
      "\u201cThanks to industry action, methane emissions continue to decline as production increases, and we support building on this progress through smart and effective regulation,\u201d said Amanda Eversole, the executive vice president and chief advocacy officer at API.",
      "Globally, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have been steadily climbing.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who chairs the Senate's Environment and Public Works committee, spoke in favor of repeal on the Senate floor.",
      "\u201cWe should be expanding natural gas production, not restricting it. Instead, the natural gas tax will constrain American natural gas production, leading to increased energy prices and providing a boost to the production of natural gas in Russia,\u201d she said.",
      "When gas leaks, the producer is wasting gas it could keep and sell.",
      "Repeal of the methane fee is the latest of several pro-oil and gas moves Republicans have taken since the start of Trump's term. On his first day, he declared a national energy emergency, calling for more oil and gas production, and fewer environmental reviews. Democrats failed to overturn that declaration yesterday. Trump has also lifted a pause on new applications for liquified natural gas export terminals, removed the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and moved to open up more areas of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling.",
      "The fee on methane releases was aimed at pushing companies to adopt better practices to curb emissions and make their operations more efficient. The EPA had said the fee was expected to reduce 1.2 million metric tons of methane emissions by 2035 \u2014 that\u2019s about the same as removing 8 million cars from the road for a year.",
      "The Biden administration had also implemented methane regulations on existing oil and gas wells, after addressing methane escaping from new wells. The EPA at the time meant for the fee to complement that rule and focus on the worst polluters.",
      "About half of all methane emissions from wells are from just 6% that are smaller producers, according to a recent study.",

Residents in Goma, which was once a critical trade and humanitarian hub, say they are struggling on various fronts even as the rebels try to consolidate their administration and restart normal life.",
      "On the streets of Goma, which is close to the border with Rwanda, economic activities have largely slowed down since the M23 rebels took over on Jan. 28. Banks are still shut, basic services such as trade are slowly restarting and thousands displaced by the conflict are desperate for aid and temporary shelters.",

      "The city and its environs had hosted more than 500,000 displaced people in addition to its population of 2 million, before the M23 rebels seized it last month in a major escalation of their yearslong fighting with government forces in the central African nation.",
      "With the support of around 4,000 troops from Rwanda, the rebels fought off overstretched and outnumbered Congolese forces \u2014 many of whom surrendered \u2014 and started to gain more territories, taking Bukavu, a second major city in the region. The expansion is unprecedented, unlike in 2012 when M23 captured Goma for days, and has raised the risks of regional warfare, analysts say.",
      "Although the rebels have agreed to talks that neighbors have pushed for, Congo's government accuses them of carrying out human rights abuses and using their campaign to advance the interests of Rwanda.",
      "The rebellion has meant that the devastated city, which used to be a key trade route, has struggled economically as schools and other social services haven't returned to normal levels.",
      "The M23 has tried to strengthen their grip on the city, pushing for social services like electricity and water supplies to return. But life is still far from normal, locals say, many of them living in fear and uncertainty about what could happen next.",
      "Roads that were once bustling with heavy traffic and shopping outlets are often deserted and heavily militarized with armed rebels at every corner.",
      "As the M23 advanced towards Goma in January, the number of residents fleeing to safety sharply grew from hundreds to thousands. By the time the city had fallen to the rebellion, hundreds of thousands of people who were already displaced by the conflict had fled once again, the U.N. said.",
      "Despite M23\u2019s promises to restart economic activities, commercial banks haven't resumed operations as the local branch of the Central Bank of Congo remains closed down.",
      "The bank closures have led to concerns that the rebels could seek alternative banking systems independent of the Congolese government\u2019s control, a major setback to regional efforts to get them to withdraw from the city.",
      "\u201cThe only solution to this crisis would be a rigorous management of available resources and the establishment of alternative financial structures such as microfinance institutions,\u201d said Deo Bengehya, a Goma-based professor of economic sciences.",
      "The prolonged suspension of banking activities could further weaken the local economy and squeeze the population, which is already struggling with job losses and price hikes, he added.",
      "Residents, meanwhile, continue to flee from Goma to other neighboring countries and towards the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away.",

      "The European Union is insisting that the 27-nation bloc is not out to undermine the United States as U.S. President Donald Trump put it",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Thursday pushed back hard against allegations by U.S. President Donald Trump that the 27-nation bloc was out to get the United States, and warned that it would vigorously fight any wholesale tariff of 25% on all EU products.",
      "The tit-for-tat dispute following the vitriolic comments of Trump aimed at an age-old ally and its main postwar economic partner further deepened the trans-Atlantic rift that was already widened by Trump's warnings that Washington would drop security guarantees for its European allies.",
      "Thursday's EU pushback came after Trump told reporters that \u201cthe European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That\u2019s the purpose of it, and they\u2019ve done a good job of it,\u201d adding that it would stop immediately under his presidency.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, went on a counteroffensive.",
      "\u201cThe EU wasn\u2019t formed to screw anyone,\" Tusk said in an X post. \"Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade, and to strengthen our transatlantic friendship. As simple as that.\u201d",
      "The EU also warned that the moment the tariffs would be announced, it would trigger tough countermeasures, on iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles.",
      "\u201cThe EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade,\u201d European Commission trade spokesman Olof Gill said in a statement. \u201cWe will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.\u201d",

      "A grassroots organization is encouraging U.S. residents not to spend any money on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- A grassroots organization is encouraging U.S. residents not to spend any money Friday as an act of \u201ceconomic resistance\u201d to protest what the group's founder sees as the malign influence of billionaires, big corporations and both major political parties on the lives of working Americans.",
      "The People's Union USA calls the 24 hours of spending abstinence set to start at midnight an \u201ceconomic blackout,\u201d a term that has since been shared and debated on social media. The activist movement said it also plans to promote weeklong consumer boycotts of particular companies, including Walmart and Amazon.",
      "Other activists, faith-based leaders and consumers already are organizing boycotts to protest companies that have scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and to oppose President Donald Trump's moves to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies. Some faith leaders are encouraging their congregations to refrain from shopping at Target, one of the companies backing off DEI efforts, during the 40 days of Lent that begin Wednesday.",
      "Here are some details about the various events and experts' thoughts on whether having consumers keep their wallets closed is an effective tool for influencing the positions corporations take.",
      "The People's Union USA, which takes credit for initiating the no-spend day, was founded by John Schwarz, a meditation teacher who lives near the Chicago area, according to his social media accounts.",
      "The organization's website said it's not tied to a political party but stands for all people. Requests for comment sent to the group's email address this week did not receive a reply.",
      "The planned blackout is scheduled to run from 12 a.m. EST through 11:59 p.m. EST on Friday. The activist group advised customers to abstain from making any purchases, whether in store or online, but particularly not from big retailers or chains. It wants participants to avoid fast food and filling their car gas tanks, and says shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support a local small business and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "People's Union plans another broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing boycotts targeting specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",
      "There are a number of boycotts being planned, particularly aimed at Target. The discounter, which has backed diversity and inclusion efforts aimed at uplifting Black and LGBTQ+ people in the past, announced in January it was rolling back its DEI initiatives.",
      "A labor advocacy group called We Are Somebody, led by Nina Turner, launched a boycott of Target on February 1 to coincide with Black History Month.",
      "Meanwhile, an Atlanta-area pastor, the Rev. Jamal Bryant, organized a website called targetfast.org to recruit Christians for a a 40-day Target boycott starting March 5, which marks Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Other faith leaders have endorsed the protest.",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization, announced in late January it would identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be boycotted for abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion pledges. The organization formed a commission to identify potential candidates.",
      "\"Donald Trump can cut federal DEI programs to the bone, he can claw back federal money to expand diversity, but he cannot tell us what grocery store we shop at,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement posted on the National Action Network's website.",
      "Some retailers may feel a slight pinch from Friday's broad \u201cblackout,\u201d which is taking place in a tough economic environment, experts said. Renewed inflation worries and Trump's threat of tariffs on imported goods already have had an effect on consumer sentiment.",
      "\u201cThe (market share) pie is just so big,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to have your slices get smaller. Consumers are spending more money on food. And that means there\u2019s more pressure on general merchandise or discretionary products.\u201d",
      "Still, Cohen thinks the overall impact may be limited, with any meaningful sales declines more likely to surface in liberal-leaning coastal regions and big cities.",
      "Anna Tuchman, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said she thinks the economic blackout will likely make a dent in daily retail sales but won't be sustainable.",
      "\u201cI think this is an opportunity for consumers to show that they have a voice on a single day,\" she said. \u201dI think it\u2019s unlikely that we would see long-run sustained decreases in economic activity supported by this boycott.\u201d",
      "Other boycotts have produced different results.",
      "Target saw a drop in sales in the spring and summer quarter of 2023 that the discounter attributed in part to customer backlash over a collection honoring LGBTQ+ communities for Pride Month. As a result, Target didn\u2019t carry Pride merchandise in all of its stores the following year.",
      "Tuchman studied the impact of a boycott against Goya Foods during the summer of 2020 after the company's CEO praised Trump. But her study, based on sales from research firm Numerator, found the brand saw a sales increase driven by first-time Goya buyers who were disproportionately from heavily Republican areas.",
      "However, the revenue bump proved temporary; Goya had no detectable sales increase after three weeks, Tuchman said.",
      "It was a different story for Bud Light, which spent decades as America\u2019s bestselling beer. Sales plummeted in 2023 after the brand sent a commemorative can to a transgender influencer. Bud Light\u2019s sales still haven\u2019t fully recovered, according to alcohol consulting company Bump Williams.",
      "Tuchman thinks a reason is because there were plenty of other beers that the brand\u2019s mostly conservative customer base could buy to replace Bud Light.",
      "Afya Evans, a political and image consultant in Atlanta, said she would make a point of shopping on Friday but will focus on small businesses and Black-owned brands.",
      "Evans is aware of other boycotts but she said she liked this one because she believes it could have some effect on sales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a broader thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see what the impact is. Let everybody participate. And plan from there.\u201d",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Students in Bangladesh who led a mass uprising to topple former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last summer are now diving into politics by forming the new National Citizen Party.",
      "The aim is to create new political space in a fiercely divisive dynastic political landscape. For decades, the country\u2019s politics have been dominated by two former prime ministers and archrivals \u2014 Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.",
      "The announcement came Friday at a rally in front of Parliament in Dhaka, during which political reforms were promised for a country born in 1971 through a bloody war against Pakistan.",
      "Thousands of people, mainly youths, gathered to witness the moment. Critics of Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who heads the interim government, say the new party is nothing but a \u201cKing\u2019s Party\u201d blessed by him. But political analysts say the new platform might be able to break the decades-long traditional political power structure in the South Asian nation.",
      "The new party has been named the Jatiya Nagarik Party, or National Citizen Party.",
      "Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old prominent student leader, was named as the head of the party. Nine other officials \u2014 all of them student leaders who rose to prominence during the mass uprising in July and August \u2014 have been named to top positions, according to Bangladeshi media.",
      "A 151-member committee of the party was announced during the launch.",
      "Supporters say a party is needed to bring reforms to the country\u2019s political culture of nepotism, and to tackle corruption and lack of democratic practices.",
      "Islam announced that the party\u2019s mission is to dismantle \u201cconstitutional autocracy and adopt a new democratic constitution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must eliminate all possibilities of restoring constitutional autocracy. Now is the time to dream anew, to march forward, and to build a new Bangladesh,\u201d Islam said as he read out the declaration.",
      "He said that the mass uprising wasn't merely about ousting a government, but also about reshaping the entire political framework.",
      "The party is committed to fostering a political culture where \u201cunity prevails over division, justice replaces vengeance, and merit triumphs over dynastic politics,\u201d Islam said.",
      "The organizers said that they invited Yunus, his interim government\u2019s other advisers, heads of political parties, including Zia\u2019s Bangladesh Nationalist Party and others.",
      "Hasina\u2019s Awami League Party and its 13 other previous allies weren't invited to the launching ceremony. Yunus or other advisers from his interim Cabinet didn't attend the event. Foreign diplomats were also invited but diplomats from India and other major global powers weren't spotted at the rally.",
      "Islam and his colleagues have been campaigning for months for Hasina to be put on trial for hundreds of deaths during the July-August uprising. The student leaders involved in the new party have also talked fiercely against India, accusing the neighboring country of exhibiting hegemony over Bangladesh, drawing a sharp reaction from India.",
      "On Friday, a giant stage was installed on a major thoroughfare just in front of the Parliament building in Dhaka. The organizers said they expected up to 300,000 people during the party\u2019s launch. But witnesses said up to 50,000 attended the event.",
      "After the installation of the interim government, Yunus repeatedly said that he was appointed by the students who led the anti-Hasina uprising.",
      "It wasn't clear if Yunus had any direct role behind forming the new party, but many critics of Yunus said, mainly on social media, that the formation of the party is an effort to unveil a \u201cking\u2019s party.\u201d",
      "But Bangladeshi analyst Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah told The Associated Press: \u201cMost probably it\u2019s more than that.",

      "Kalimullah said the new party \u201cmost probably\u201d has \u201ca future.\u201d",
      "The new party is expected to seek registration with the country\u2019s Election Commission to participate in the next election, which is expected to be held either in December or by June 2026.",
      "The party will try to form an alliance with other parties except Zia\u2019s Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is hoping to form the next government. The new party\u2019s relationship with the Jamaat-e-Islami party remains unclear.",
      "Hasina\u2019s Bangladesh Awami League party is under tremendous pressure after she fled to India and thousands of party leaders and activists have either left the country, gone into hiding or have been arrested. The student wing of Hasina\u2019s party has already been banned by the Yunus-led government, which has been struggling to stabilize the country's law and order situation since the ouster of Hasina."

      "A federal judge in San Francisco finds the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful, granting temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration\u2019s massive dismantling of the federal workforce.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including the Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cOPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe,\u201d to hire or fire any employees but its own, Alsup said.",
      "The complaint filed by five labor unions and five nonprofit organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal workforce, which Trump has called bloated and sloppy. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and his administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service protection.",
      "Lawyers for the government agree that the office has no authority to hire or fire employees in other agencies.",
      "But they say the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for continued employment. They also say that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.",
      "Attorneys for the coalition cheered the order, although it does not mean that fired employees will automatically be rehired or that future firings will not occur.",
      "\u201cWhat it means in practical effects is the agencies of the federal government should hear the court\u2019s warning that that order was unlawful,\u201d said Danielle Leonard, an attorney for the coalition, after the hearing.",
      "Emails for comment to the Office of Personnel Management and the U.S. Department of Justice were not immediately returned Thursday.",
      "Alsup ordered the personnel office to inform a limited number of federal agencies represented by the five nonprofits that are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which include veterans, parks, small businesses and defense. He seemed particularly troubled by firings expected at the Department of Defense.",
      "He also ordered the acting head of the personnel office, Charles Ezell, to testify in court about the nature of a Feb. 13 phone call in which agency heads were told to fire probationary employees.",
      "\u201cThe agencies could thumb their noses at OPM if they wanted to if it\u2019s guidance, but if it\u2019s an order, or cast as an order, the agencies may think they have to comply,\u201d he said.",
      "There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers \u2014 generally employees who have less than a year on the job \u2014 across federal agencies. About 15,000 are employed in California, providing services ranging from fire prevention to veterans\u2019 care, the complaint says.",
      "Elon Musk has led the purge through the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, roiling the workforce with demands including a Saturday email sent through the personnel office ordering workers to list five things they did last week or risk getting fired. The Office of Personnel Management later said that the edict was voluntary, although workers could face similar requests in the future.",
      "The plaintiffs said in their complaint that numerous agencies informed workers that the personnel office had ordered the terminations, with an order to use a template e-mail informing workers their firing was for performance reasons.",
      "Probationary employees of the National Science Foundation, for example, were told by the foundation that it had decided to retain its workers but was overruled by the Office of Personnel Management, according to the complaint.",
      "Unions have recently struck out with two other federal judges.",
      "A judge in Washington, D.C., last week denied a motion from unions to temporarily block layoffs because he found their complaint should be heard in federal labor court. Earlier this month, a judge in Massachusetts said unions suing over a deferred resignation offer weren\u2019t directly affected and so lacked legal standing to challenge it.",
      "Alsup said labor unions likely lack legal standing to sue, but the nonprofit organizations likely have cause because their members will be denied government services resulting from the loss of workers, such as the enjoyment of parks, mental health services for veterans and loans for small businesses.",
      "He was appalled that probationary employees were fired with a mark against them for poor performance.",
      "\u201cProbationary employees are the lifeblood of our government,\u201d he said, adding that they are younger employees who work their way up.",
      "Alsup plans to issue a written order. An evidentiary hearing is set for March 13."

      "A key price gauge declined last month, a sign that inflation may be cooling though stiff tariffs threatened by the White House threaten that progress",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumers cut back sharply on spending last month, the most since February 2021, even as inflation declined, though stiff tariffs threatened by the White House could disrupt that progress.",
      "Americans cut their spending by 0.2% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday, likely in part because of unseasonably cold weather. Yet the retreat may be hinting at more caution by consumers amid rising economic uncertainty.",
      "Inflation declined to 2.5% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.6% in December, the government said. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices dropped to 2.6%, the lowest since June, from 2.9%.",
      "One other bright spot in the report was that incomes jumped 0.9% in January from December, fueled in part by a large annual cost of living adjustment for Social Security beneficiaries.",
      "Inflation spiked in 2022 to its highest level in four decades, propelling President Donald Trump to the White House and causing the Federal Reserve to rapidly raise interest rates to tame prices. It has since fallen from a peak of 7.2%.",
      "Last month\u2019s decline could reassure Fed officials that inflation is still slowly cooling. The Fed prefers Friday\u2019s measure to the more widely-known consumer price index, which rose for the fourth straight month in January to 3%. Friday\u2019s gauge calculates inflation slightly differently: For example, it puts less weight on the costs of housing and used cars.",
      "Even so, the key question preoccupying many American consumers, investors, and business executives is whether Trump\u2019s extensive tariff proposals will push prices higher in the coming months. Trump said Thursday he will double his recently-announced tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%, and will impose 25% import taxes on Canada and Mexico next Tuesday. The three countries are the United States\u2019 top trading partners.",
      "Trump is also calling for widespread layoffs of federal workers, which could cause hundreds of thousands of job losses and potentially lift the unemployment rate.",
      "\u201cIncreased uncertainty surrounding trade, fiscal and regulatory policy is casting a shadow over the outlook,\u201d said Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at accounting and consulting firm EY.",
      "Americans also likely cut back on their spending after a healthy winter holiday season that saw a surge in credit card debt in December, economists noted.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% in January from the previous month, matching December\u2019s 0.3% increase. Core prices rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% in December. If sustained, January\u2019s increases would keep inflation running above the Fed\u2019s target. The Fed pays more attention to core prices because they provide a better read of future inflation.",
      "A big concern right now is whether tariffs will push up inflation, or slow the economy, or \u2014 in a particularly toxic combination \u2014 both.",
      "A report from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Boston branch this month concluded that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with Trump\u2019s initial 10% import taxes on China, could lift core inflation by as much as 0.8 percentage points.",
      "The last time Trump imposed tariffs in 2018-19, inflation was largely unaffected \u2014 but those tariffs were on a much narrower range of goods. And the economy still slowed, prompting the Fed to cut interest rates.",
      "Worries about tariffs pushing prices higher have sent consumer confidence plunging, unwinding the modest gains that had occurred after the election. Americans are also expecting inflation to move higher in the coming months. That\u2019s a risky trend because if consumers and businesses expect higher prices, they may act in ways to lift inflation, such as accelerating their purchases and boosting demand."

      "Intuitive Machines\u2019 lander, named Athena, caught a lift with SpaceX from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. It\u2019s taking a fast track to the moon \u2014 with a landing on March 6 \u2014 while hoping to avoid the fate of its predecessor, which tipped over at touchdown.",
      "Never before have so many spacecraft angled for the moon\u2019s surface all at once. Last month, U.S. and Japanese companies shared a rocket and separately launched landers toward Earth's sidekick. Texas-based Firefly Aerospace should get there first this weekend after a big head start.",

      "This isn\u2019t Intuitive Machines\u2019 first lunar rodeo. Last year, the Texas company made the first U.S. touchdown on the moon in more than 50 years. But an instrument that gauges distance did not work and the lander came down too hard and broke a leg, tipping onto its side.",
      "Intuitive Machines said it has fixed the issue and dozens of others. A sideways landing like last time would prevent the drone and a pair of rovers from moving out. NASA\u2019s drill also needs an upright landing to pierce beneath the lunar surface to gather soil samples for analysis.",

      "It\u2019s an extraordinarily elite club. Only five countries have pulled off a lunar landing over the decades: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. The moon is littered with wreckage from many past failures.",
      "The 15-foot (4.7-meter) Athena will target a landing 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the lunar south pole. Just a quarter-mile (400 meters) away is a permanently shadowed crater \u2014 the ultimate destination for the drone named Grace.",
      "Named after the late computer programming pioneer Grace Hopper, the 3-foot (1-meter) drone will make three increasingly higher and longer test hops across the lunar surface using hydrazine fueled-thrusters for flight and cameras and lasers for navigation.",
      "If those excursions go well, it will hop into the nearby pitch-black crater, an estimated 65 feet (20 meters) deep. Science instruments from Hungary and Germany will take measurements at the bottom while hunting for frozen water.",
      "It will be the first up-close peek inside one of the many shadowed craters dotting both the north and south poles. Scientists suspect these craters are packed with tons of ice. If so, this ice could be transformed by future explorers into water to drink, air to breathe and even rocket fuel.",
      "NASA is paying $62 million to Intuitive Machines to get its drill and other experiments to the moon. The company, in turn, sold space on the lander to others. It also opened up the Falcon rocket to ride-sharing.",
      "Tagalongs included NASA\u2019s Lunar Trailblazer satellite, which will fly separately to the moon over the next several months before entering lunar orbit to map the distribution of water below. Also catching a ride was a private spacecraft that will chase after an asteroid for a flyby, a precursor to asteroid mining.",

      "The U.S. lobster industry continued a multiyear slide in catch last year",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- The U.S. lobster industry's catch keeps sliding as fishermen contend with the northward migration of the valuable crustaceans.",
      "The industry is based mostly in Maine, where lobsters are both a cultural signifier and the backbone of the coastal economy. The state's haul of lobsters has declined every year from 2021, when it was nearly 111 million pounds, to 2023, when it was less than 97 million pounds.",
      "That decline extended into 2024, when the haul was about 86.1 million pounds, according to data released by state regulators on Friday. That is the lowest figure in 15 years. A series of major storms that damaged waterfront communities and disrupted fisheries was a key factor in the reduced catch, officials said.",
      "Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, praised the industry for its perseverance.",
      "\u201cDuring a year shaped by unprecedented storms and damage to our working waterfronts, Maine\u2019s commercial fishermen, aquaculturists, and seafood dealers once again delivered a major economic benefit to our state,\u201d she said.",
      "Last year\u2019s catch was still historically high, as Maine fishermen never exceeded 80 million pounds prior to 2009. Hauls in the 2000s were typically between 50 million and 80 million pounds. Hauls in the mid-2010s were routinely above 120 million pounds.",
      "The fishery remained economically strong in 2024. Maine fishermen took home more than $528 million at the docks, and that was the highest total since 2021, state officials said. Demand for the product, one of the most expensive seafoods, remained high, and the price per pound was one of the highest on record.",
      "The state is meeting the challenges of climate change head-on, said Patrick Keliher, the commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The governor has secured funding to \"help rebuild damaged coastal infrastructure, make it more resilient to the effects of climate change, and protect critically important waterfront access for those who make a living on the water,\u201d he said.",
      "But numerous environmental and economic challenges threaten the industry's future. One of the biggest is the decline in the number of baby lobsters settling off New England. The young lobsters have to take shelter and grow to legal size to sustain the future of the fishery. Scientists have said the lobster population is migrating north to cooler habitats as oceans warm.",
      "The Maine lobster industry is also linked to Canada\u2019s seafood industry and could be disrupted by new tariffs. Canadian fishermen harvest the same species of lobster as American fishermen, and much of the processing capacity for the seafood is in Canada. Tariffs are likely to increase prices on both sides of the border, members of the industry have said.",
      "Another major challenge is the possibility of new rules to protect critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, which are vulnerable to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Fishing groups have engaged in protracted court cases against the government over stricter fishing rules.",
      "Other states, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, also have lobster fishing industries, but Maine's is by far the largest, and the size of the Maine harvest gives a firm indication of the health of the American lobster industry at large. Maine accounted for about 78% of the country's total lobster haul in 2023."

      "BOSTON -- With Celtics fans in a frenzy throughout TD Garden after the Boston Celtics blitzed to a 25-3 lead over the Cavaliers in the final matchup of Eastern Conference frontrunners, Cleveland star Donovan Mitchell didn't panic.",
      "He actually was in a calm place.",
      "\u201cEverything that could have possibly went wrong, went wrong. At that point, you could only go up from there,\u201d Mitchell said after posting his first 40-point game this season. \"That\u2019s been our challenge all year. How do you respond? And we did.\u201d",
      "What followed was three quarters of frenetic basketball that concluded with 41 points by Mitchell and a breakout night by teammate Evan Mobley that added up to a 123-116 win and a ninth straight victory by the Cavs team that earned a season split with a Celtics team they could very well see in the playoffs.",
      "The Celtics led throughout before the Cavaliers settled in and took their first lead of the game, 104-101 in the fourth quarter.",
      "Cleveland stretched its lead to 114-110 when the Celtics got back-to-back stops, each followed by buckets by Jaylen Brown to tie the game.",
      "Mitchell scored on a floater to put the Cavaliers back in front. Then, following a miss by Brown on Boston\u2019s next possession, Mitchell hit a driving layup and was fouled. He completed the three-point play to put the Cavs in front 119-114 with 1:57 remaining.",
      "Mitchell said Brown's flurry inspired him to respond after slow start to the period.",
      "\u201cJust kind of having a pulse. Having a feel. I took some bad ones (shots) in the fourth that I didn\u2019t like, kind of settle,\" Mitchell said. \"But that\u2019s part of the process. But for me, kind of doing my job when my number\u2019s called. Keeping it steady. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d",
      "As remarkable as Mitchell was, the spark for Cleveland's final fourth-quarter push actually belonged to Mobley. He had 13 points and eight rebounds in the final quarter, including the Cavs' first nine points of the period.",
      "Mobley said it was a reminder to that he has the capacity to be an elite big man in the NBA.",
      "But as happy as they were to leave the court with a victory, Mitchell said it was tempered by the fact that the NBA's top offense found itself in a 22-point hole to begin with.",
      "\u201cComing into the game it was like, no championship is being won tonight,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt was like, we got punched in the mouth. What are we going to do about it?\u201d",
      "Still, coach Kenny Atkinson said that kind of comeback is something to build on.",
      "\u201cYou go into the locker room ... guys feel like they're as good as these guys,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cWe can hang with these guys. Keep at it. Stay with it. So, yeah, this gives us a little more confidence. But there's context around that. We know they're missing two guys. Humble in victory, that's for sure.\"",

      "Doncic scored 10 points in the fourth quarter of a gritty performance by the Lakers, who were missing two injured starters on the second night of a back-to-back home set.

      "After struggling with his shot again for three quarters, Doncic hit consecutive 3-pointers midway through the fourth to stretch the lead to 10 points.",

      "Lakers: An impressive performance with minimal rest and a depleted lineup. Austin Reaves left in the first quarter with calf soreness, while Rui Hachimura sat out after straining his left knee Thursday. Coach JJ Redick said he's \u201coptimistic\u201d Hachimura's injury isn't serious.",

      "Doncic is sixth in NBA history in points scored before his 26th birthday (12,205). James is first (16,081), while Doncic finished just 10 points behind fifth-place Kobe Bryant (12,215).",

    "story": [
      "Motorsports viewers might associate Jamie Little with Fox\u2019s coverage of NASCAR\u2019s Cup Series",
      "Motorsports viewers might associate Jamie Little with Fox's coverage of NASCAR's Cup Series. But Little will be seen across more of Fox's motorsports coverage this year.",
      "Little will be one of the pit reporters Sunday when Fox carries its first IndyCar race from the streets of downtown St. Petersburg, Florida. She also will be the play-by-play announcer the entire season for the network's coverage of the Truck series.",
      "The IndyCar assignment is a bit of a homecoming for Little, who was the pit reporter for ESPN and ABC's coverage of the open-wheel series from 2004 through '14. Little \u2014 whose last IndyCar race was the 2014 Indianapolis 500 \u2014 will be filling in for Georgia Henneberry, who recently had a baby and will miss the first couple races.",
      "Little, who will also be part of Fox's coverage of the Indianapolis 500 on May 25, also is hoping Sunday that some NASCAR fans will tune in as well because the IndyCar race comes before the NASCAR Cup Series road race at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to cross-promote as much as we can. It\u2019s our first doubleheader. IndyCar is the first race followed by NASCAR,\" Little said. \"I\u2019m the one person that does both, so they\u2019re asking me to be there to try to blend those two worlds.\u201d",
      "One of the ways Little will try to bridge the gap between IndyCar and NASCAR is a feature on Kyle Larson with segments airing in both shows. Larson will once again this year attempt to do the Indy 500 and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 in the same day.",
      "Larson didn't get the chance to do it last year when rain delayed the start of the Indy race and then shortened the finish of the NASCAR race in Charlotte.",
      "The move to Fox also marks the first time an entire motorsports series will be on broadcast television. Fox aired ads featuring top drivers Josef Newgarden, Alex Palou and Pato O\u2019Ward during the NFL playoffs and Super Bowl 59.",
      "\u201cI think there is nothing better that you can do to help grow this sport and grow the viewership than to have it on a network where if you\u2019re sitting in a bar or you\u2019re having brunch on a Sunday and it\u2019ll be on TV, People will see it and be exposed to it like never before,\u201d Little said. \u201cEverybody is excited about the promotion that\u2019s already been done.\u201d",
      "The other change for Little this season is that she will call the entire NASCAR Truck series schedule. She called select truck races the past three seasons but will have the entire year with Adam Alexander moving to the CW to do the Xfinity Series.",
      "Little became the first woman to do TV play-by-play for a U.S. national racing series broadcast in 2021 when she did the ARCA Menards Series.",
      "Little had briefly considered doing some play-by-play, but the idea gained momentum after Leigh Diffey, who does NASCAR races for NBC, called Little and said with the growing number of women doing play-by-play, Little needed to be that person in NASCAR.",
      "\u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was possible because it\u2019s just you always hear a man\u2019s voice. I didn\u2019t know what that was a role I would enjoy it or if I would be welcomed in that role,\u201d Little said. \u201cI thought about it and he was right. I have done everything I can as a pit reporter and I\u2019ll continue to do that, but I want to test myself. I want to challenge myself, step out of that comfort zone.\u201d",
      "Little has become more comfortable as a play-by-play announcer. She said her original approach was the same as if she was a pit reporter in discussing stories, but that has changed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a skill set, and you\u2019re a traffic control cop,\" she said. \"Yes, there is time to tell those stories, to update these drivers and what\u2019s happening, but that\u2019s why you have the support of your analysts there explaining what\u2019s happening on the track. It\u2019s bringing everybody together and keeping that conversation flowing.\u201d",
      "Sunday's IndyCar race is in the midst of a busy stretch for Little. Since the beginning of February, she was a reporter for the Westminster Dog show, has called two Trucks races and one ARCA, been the pit reporter for the first two Cup series races and interviewed President Donald Trump before the Daytona 500.",

      "ROME -- The FBI has accused North Korean-linked hackers of conducting one of the largest thefts of cryptocurrency publicly known, seizing some $1.5 billion worth of ethereum from a Dubai-based firm.",

      "Unwanted phone calls are out of control",
      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",
      "Cybersecurity company Kaspersky advises not even saying anything when you receive what you think is a robocall. We've all received scammy calls that start with something like \u201cHello, can you hear me?\u201d to which you've probably replied \u201cyes\u201d without thinking.",
      "Scammers \u201ccan then store the recording of your confirmation and use it for fraudulent activities,\u201d Kaspersky says. \u201cSo, avoid saying yes where possible.\u201d",

      "Officials say a first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea",
      "AYIA NAPA, Cyprus -- A first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea, officials said Monday.",
      "The small, autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, hailed as the \u201cfuture of underwater surveillance\u201d will be equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to give scientists at the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute a clear picture on the effectiveness of their intricate artificial reefs designed and built using 3D printing.",
      "Made of an environmentally friendly cement mixture, the artificial reefs will be embedded with a docking station at which the AUVs can recharge and transmit collected data including video, said CMMI CEO Zakarias Siokouros.",
      "The advantage of the AUVs lies in their ability to loiter underwater for as long as a month at a time and provide a continuous flow of data while \u201cprotecting\u201d the reefs by alerting scientists to any disturbance in protected waters from illegal fishing and encroaching boats. Scientists would, in turn, notify local authorities.",
      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

      "\"The toll, the human lives that will be lost, is unfathomable.\"",
      "After a month of fits and starts, a final hammer came down on the U.S. Agency for International Development on Wednesday night when the State Department, which had previously said it was going to review all foreign aid, announced that review was over and it had decided to terminate nearly 10,000 government contracts worth about $60 billion in humanitarian work abroad.",
      "The cancellations left aid organizations reeling Thursday.",
      "Many, for weeks, had been advocating behind closed doors for their projects to continue and applying for waivers in order to deliver immediate, lifesaving aid while the review process was underway. Several organizations on Thursday decided to start to speak out as they face a future with almost all U.S. foreign aid cut off.",
      "\"Any type of communicable disease, I think we will see rage rampant. I think we will see increased conflict in the world. I think we will see increased terrorism in the world. And so, I think, the implications are going to be really dire in terms of the instability that this creates in already very unstable regions of the world,\" said Jocelyn Wyatt, CEO of Alight, an international organization that provides food, medicine and services for refugees in 20 countries around the world.",
      "Like all international aid organizations, four days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, Alight was told to suspend all programming funded through U.S. grants and contracts.",
      "Wyatt described scrambling to keep her organization's health care clinics afloat. They had to shutter programs in Uganda and Myanmar but were able to secure waivers from the State Department for lifesaving humanitarian aid to keep their operations going in Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan.",
      "But as of Thursday, all of Alight's U.S. contracts have been canceled going forward, even contracts related to those programs that had received waivers to continue in the last few weeks.",
      "Now, Wyatt said Alight is closing 33 health care clinics in Sudan, many in areas where they were the only health care provider, as well as water and sanitization services in three refugees camps in the country and another 13 clinics in Somalia.",
      "According to Wyatt, their clinics see 1,200 people a day in Somalia alone, including about 700 malnourished children a day at designated feeding centers where the children get weighed and provided with supplemental food.",
      "\"We are unable to provide any services to those severely malnourished children, and so it's really a matter of days or weeks before many of them will die,\" she told ABC News during an interview Thursday. \"The toll, the human lives that will be lost, is unfathomable.\"",
      "Thursday appeared to be a watershed moment for humanitarian leaders who, so far, had been reticent to speak put publicly out of concern that their organizations could face backlash or see grants and contracts suffer.",
      "David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, called the termination of contracts \"a devastating blow.\"",
      "\"These are people who depend on the U.S.-funded services for the basics of survival. These programs are not just numbers on a spreadsheet; they represent real lives and real futures,\" he wrote in a statement, calling on the U.S. government to reconsider. \"The countries affected by these cuts -- including Sudan, Yemen, Syria -- are home to millions of innocent civilians who are victims of war and disaster. We now face the starkest of stark choices about which services can be protected, and are calling on the American public, corporations and philanthropists to show that America's generosity of spirit and commitment to the most vulnerable has not been lost.\"",
      "\"We are no longer the shining city on a hill,\" one humanitarian leader, who requested to speak anonymously out of fear of retribution for his organization, said to ABC News in an interview Thursday.",
      "\"It seems cruelty is the point. This is not about putting America first. This will kill people around the world,\" the leader added.",
      "While aid organizations expected a review of their work with the new administration, the scope and scale of the cuts have been shocking and will mean many aid organizations will be forced to dramatically cut their work or shutdown all together.",
      "The termination notices were included in a court filing late Wednesday as leading aid organizations sued the federal government over nearly $2 billion in past payments they say they are owed for work already completed during the first part of this year.",
      "The filing stated that almost 5,800 USAID awards for future work, and approximately 4,100 distributed through the State Department, will be terminated, while around 500 USAID awards and roughly 2,700 State Department awards will be retained.",
      "Alight typically relies on U.S. foreign aid dollars for about 30% of their revenue and they have already had to lay off hundreds of staff members as they also wait for payments due from the U.S. federal government for work previously done.",
      "Still, Wyatt said her organization will survive and worries about others that will not as well as the impact it will have on the people they serve.",
      "Despite the turmoil of the last few weeks, she was reticent to speak publicly out of a concern that her organizatio,n and the clients they serve, could be impacted and retaliated against.",
      "She said she understands the new administration's push to evaluate taxpayer spending and foreign aid and that she was prepared to undergo an evaluation of their organization and make sure it aligned with Trump's American First foreign policy.",
      "But now that all of her contracts have been cancelled, Wyatt hopes to raise awareness and apply public pressure.",
      "International Medical Corps, one of the largest first responder and disaster relief organizations in the world, wrote in a statement that they received cancellation notices for \"the majority of our U.S. government-funded programs\" late Wednesday night.",
      "\"As a result, we are in the process of closing affected programs. Though we receive funding from a variety of sources, this loss of funding will significantly impact our lifesaving global operations. To navigate this challenge, we will need to implement substantial changes across the organization in the coming days and weeks,\" the statement read.",
      "The IMC, which works in over 30 countries and last year alone said they provided direct health care services to over 16.5 million people, had received about half of its funding from the U.S. It is also currently runs two of the only field hospitals still operational in Gaza.",
      "Global Refuge, formerly Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, wrote in a statement Thursday that the contract terminations did not amount to a \"simple review of federal resources,\" but instead, \"seeks to end America's longstanding religious tradition of helping the least among us.\"",

      "\"When we got on the [military] plane, they put restraints on our hands, feet, and waist,\" said Jose, who requested that his last name not be used out of fear of retribution. \"They searched us and then sat us in a chair, tying us to it and binding our feet together. We hoped it wouldn't be Guantanamo but in the end, that's where we ended up.\"",

      "\"Our minds were racing, thinking we were kidnapped, wondering who would get us out of there,\" said Jose. \"Because no one tells you anything.\"",

      "\"From the moment we were there, we tried to kick the doors, we went on countless strikes,\" Jose said. \"We clogged the toilets and protested, we covered the cameras because the confinement is unbearable.\"",

      "\"They give you food ... but it's like they don't give you any, [it's] very little food,\" Jose said. \"There came a point where I would lick the plate. The food had no salt, but I would still eat it as if it were very tasty, because I was hungry.\"",
      "Jose said he and the other detainees were only allowed outside twice in two weeks and were denied phone calls with their relatives and families.",
      "\"There are four cages outside,\" Jose said. \"That's the yard. You leave one room to go into another cell.\"",
      "Representatives from the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Bastidas Paz had surrendered to authorities after crossing the U.S. southern border from Mexico in 2023. He was charged with \"improper entry\" to which he pleaded guilty, and was in a detention center in El Paso, Texas, until he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay.",

      "The Virginia gubernatorial election, which is held in an off-year cycle, is often seen as an indicator of where the political climate stands in the country. The election comes after federal job cuts carried out by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency with a goal of slimming down a bloated federal government and reducing its jobs -- many of which are stationed in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs of Virginia.",

      "If the president goes ahead with 25% taxes on imports from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday, he will disrupt more than $300 billion in annual U.S. automotive trade with its two neighbors, wreck supply chains that have been operating for decades and likely push up the already-forbidding price of new cars.",

Foran estimates that 25% tariffs would push down auto sales by 13.6% a year in Canada and 10.6% in the United States.",
      "Since 1965 \u2014 when the U.S. and Canada eliminated tariffs on each other\u2019s autos and auto parts \u2014 North America has turned into an integrated auto manufacturing powerhouse.

      "\u201cThe fact that you can tap relatively cheap steel and aluminum from Canada, that you can use the relatively low-cost labor in Mexico to assemble cars, and that you can leverage the high tech expertise and technology of the United States together, makes North America an incredibly competitive place to build automobiles,\u201d said Brett House, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Much of the production has moved to Mexico. Ford, for example, manufactures the small Bronco Sport SUV and Maverick pickup in Sonora in northwestern Mexico. Stellantis makes the Jeep Compass and Wagoneer S at a plant in Toluca, west of Mexico City, which has been in operation since 1968. General Motors turns out GMC and Chevrolet pickups at a plant in Silao in central Mexico.",
      "Just over half the 8 million cars and light trucks the United States imported last year came from Mexico (No. 1 at almost 3 million) and Canada (No. 4 at 1.1 million). Canada and Mexico are also the top two foreign markets for U.S.-built cars and light trucks, accounting for 53% of America\u2019s auto exports.",
      "By taxing Canadian and Mexican imports, most of which has been entering the U.S. duty free, Trump would be lobbing an explosive into that elaborate manufacturing network.",
      "A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the tariff plan, said the taxes would apply each time goods cross the border from Mexico or Canada. That means the costs would pile up as auto components traveled from factories in the United States to Mexico or Canada and back again. So would the red tape: \u201cIt\u2019s an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare to keep track of things,\u2019\u2019 Gantz said.",
      "What\u2019s more, the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would come atop higher taxes Trump intends to impose on foreign steel and aluminum starting March 12. Trump is removing exemptions on the metals tariffs he imposed in his first term \u2014 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum \u2014 and raising the levy on aluminum to 25%. That means U.S. importers, including auto companies, would pay 50% duties on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, big sources of the metals.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the material costs going up every time (a part) goes into one market and comes back,\u2019\u2019 said K. Venkatesh Prasad, senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research.",
      "The higher costs would take a toll. A decade ago, Prasad said, the lowest-earning 20% of American consumers couldn\u2019t afford a new car. Already, he said, \u201cthe bottom 40% of the population is not able to afford a new vehicle.\u201d",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley has complained that \u201cso far what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos.\u2019\u2019",
      "General Motors CEO Mary Barra said last month at the Wolfe Research auto industry conference that GM has been \u201cdoing scenario planning and look at what at the different things we can change, we can move, we can respond.\u2019\u2019 She expressed confidence that company can find ways to \"mitigate'' the effect of the tariffs. Stellantis chairman John Elkann recently said he thinks the administration's policies will boost American jobs and manufacturing.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war comes at an awkward time for automakers. They\u2019re trying to shift from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles, using revenue generated from selling conventional cars to finance EV investments, Prasad said, so the tariffs could hurt sales and limit the money available for the EV transition.",
      "Trump insists that the hefty hit to imports from Canada and Mexico aren\u2019t about trade; they\u2019re about slowing the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\u201d Trump wrote Thursday in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.",
      "Canada wouldn\u2019t seem to be an especially important source of fentanyl: U.S. customs agents seized just 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last year, versus the 21,100 pounds at Mexico\u2019s.",
      "Many analysts suspect that Trump has another goal: The 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement he negotiated in his first term comes up for renewal next year.",
      "Although the president characterized the USMCA as a victory and a big improvement over the 1994 pact it replaced, it failed to reduce America's trade deficits with Canada and Mexico. In fact, they've gotten bigger. (In Canada's case, that's largely because of surging energy exports that the American Midwest and Northeast rely on.)",
      "So he is likely to seek revisions meant to ensure that more production \u2014 specifically auto production \u2014 is done in the United States, not just North America. The tariffs could give him leverage to pressure Canada and Mexico into accepting the USMCA changes he wants.",
      "In the meantime, writes TD Economics' Foran, \"the North American auto industry should still prepare itself for a prolonged period of elevated trade uncertainty and potential trade disruptions.\u2019\u2019",

      "The first time Donald Trump spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he tried to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first time he spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump tried to pressure Ukraine's new leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. It was a 2019 phone call that eventually sparked an impeachment.",
      "On Friday, a meeting in the Oval Office that started out with cordialities turned heated at the end, with Vice President JD Vance telling Zelenskyy to show more gratitude toward Trump, before the president himself began shouting.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people,\" Trump berated Zelenskyy. \"You\u2019re gambling with World War III.\u201d",
      "With that, Trump scrapped plans to sign an agreement that would have allowed the U.S. to access Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, a deal the U.S. president had said would have helped move the war toward a conclusion. The blowup cast new doubt on the future of U.S. support for Kyiv in fending off Russia's invasion.",
      "A look at the evolution of Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship over the years:",
      "In July 2019, Zelenskyy was anxious for a meeting with Trump at the White House, one of the Ukrainian leader's top foreign policy priorities at the time.",
      "During a 30-minute call, Trump dangled the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. But he also suggested that future U.S. military support for Ukraine might be contingent on its leader helping investigate business dealings there by Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son.",
      "The elder Biden was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Trump seemed to want to weaken him 15 months out from Election Day.",
      "Trump denied wrongdoing and began referring to his exchange with Zelenskyy as a \u201cperfect\" phone call. Even Zelenskyy later insisted that he faced \u201cno blackmail.\u201d",
      "But Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges, only the third American commander in chief to be in that situation. He was acquitted by the Senate.",
      "Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, triggering the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has provided more than $65 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The Biden administration made steadfast military and political support for Zelenskyy's country a centerpiece of his foreign policy.",
      "As the war raged, the Biden White House staunchly defended continuing to provide support to Ukraine, even as some Republicans began grumbling about so much funding for a war that had no end in sight.",
      "In a speech to Congress in December 2022, Zelenskyy thanked \"every American\" for supporting his country.",
      "\u201cYour money is not charity,\u201d he said then. \"It\u2019s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.\u201d",
      "Trump, then campaigning for his second term, said repeatedly that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he'd been president and that he'd have no trouble solving the conflict.",
      "Upon taking office, he upended years of U.S. policy by dispatching negotiators to Saudi Arabia to meet with officials from Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, and also began hammering out the minerals deal that he and Zelenskyy had planned to sign Friday.",
      "Last September, Zelenskyy accompanied Biden to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers producing some of the most critically needed munitions for his country\u2019s fight with Russian ground forces.",
      "A few days later, he traveled to Trump Tower in Manhattan and discussed ending the war. In comments to Fox News Channel afterward, Trump said of the fighting, \u201cIt should stop and the president wants it to stop,\" meaning Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that\u2019s a good combination,\u201d Trump added. Zelenskyy invited Trump to visit Ukraine, to which Trump responded, \u201dI will.\"",
      "That trip came up again Friday, when Vance told Zelenskyy, \u201cYou went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's September trip was not billed as political, though, and Trump's election opponent was Vice President Kamala Harris, not Biden. Still, Pennsylvania is a battleground state and some congressional Republicans at the time accused Democrats of using Zelenskyy's visit to bolster Harris politically.",
      "Last December, Trump met with Zelenskyy again during a visit to Paris to attend the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral. It was a hastily arranged three-way meeting set up by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was trying to push the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "As president, Trump has publicly prodded Zelenskyy that he had better move quickly to negotiate an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, or risk no longer having a country to lead. On his social media site, Trump decried Zelenskyy for not organizing an election to decide if he should remain in power \u2014 an idea backed by Russia \u2014 calling him a \u201c dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "He also suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, but later conceded that Russia was the aggressor.",
      "Before this week, Zelenskyy had been to the White House four times \u2014 all during the Biden administration. When the Ukrainian leader announced he was coming to Washington and was ready to sign a minerals deal, Trump's tone got more conciliatory.",
      "He called America\u2019s support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion \u201ca very worthy thing to do.\u201d And, when pressed about having called Zelenskyy a dictator, Trump responded: \u201cDid I say that? I can\u2019t believe I said that. Next question.\"",
      "It all served to make Friday's blowup all the more spectacular."

      "The Associated Press obtained information that says President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has begun terminating federal grants to organizations that enforce the federal Fair Housing Act's anti-discrimination laws",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has begun terminating grants to organizations that enforce the Fair Housing Act by taking complaints, investigating and litigating housing discrimination cases for Americans across the country, according to documents and information obtained by The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "The grants are disbursed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to private nonprofits, which act as the frontline enforcement of the federal anti-discrimination law passed in 1968. They educate communities on their rights, test whether a landlord is racially discriminating, investigate complaints, resolve disputes and can help with legal counsel.",
      "Of an estimated 34,000 fair housing complaints lodged in the U.S. in 2023, these private nonprofits processed 75%, according to a report from the National Fair Housing Alliance. The rest were fielded by state and local governments, with HUD and the U.S. Department of Justice working on less than 6% combined.",
      "It is the highest number of complaints since the first report in the 1990s, and over half were lodged for discrimination based on a disability.",
      "Now, of the 162 active grants going to the private nonprofits to do that work, nearly half are slated for cancellation, said Nikitra Bailey, executive vice president at the National Fair Housing Alliance. Bailey added that some organizations rely entirely on the grants and may have to shutter, others will have to lay off staff and limit services.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s doing it at a time when Americans want to see an end to the barrage of rising housing costs and a lack of housing supply,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThey need increased support and intervention from our federal government, not a withdrawal from basic civil rights.\u201d",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for HUD said: \u201cThe Department is responsible for ensuring our grantees and contractors are in compliance with the President\u2019s Executive Orders. If we determine they are not in compliance, then we are required to take action. The Department will continue to serve the American people, including those are facing housing discrimination or eviction.\u201d",
      "The \u201cprogram really exists because the fair housing laws don\u2019t enforce themselves,\u201d said Maureen St. Cyr, executive director of Massachusetts Fair Housing Center, a group that\u2019s grant is being terminated. \u201cPeople need lawyers to make those rights a reality.\u201d",
      "St. Cyr listed several scenarios the nonprofit has helped with: a family being denied housing because they have children, a veteran with a disability needing a ramp and a domestic abuse survivor being evicted because of the actions of the abuser.",
      "\u201cWe are doing a lot of work with pretty minimal money,\u201d St. Cyr said.",
      "The grants intended for fair housing enforcement, part of HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program, are largely worth $425,000, an amount which is typically issued annually to organizations.",
      "In a termination letter, a copy of which was obtained by the AP, HUD said that the cancellations were at the direction of Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, called DOGE, run partly by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The letters caused widespread confusion across the country late Thursday night, as fair housing organizations started communicating through listservs, assessing the potential impacts and trying to find answers.",
      "One of the organizations slated to lose funding, Fair Housing Center of Metropolitan Detroit, fields about 200 to 300 fair housing complaints a year and works broadly to resolve housing related problems, such as disputes with landlords, with a coverage area of some 4 million people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a significant threat to the viability of our organization at a minimum,\u201d said Steve Tomkowiak, the group's executive director. \u201cIt can threaten the survival of any of the fair housing enforcement organizations.\u201d",
      "For Kimberly Merchant, CEO of Mississippi Center for Justice, the kneecapping of fair housing groups, or their disappearance altogether, would be \u201copen season to discriminate indiscriminately without having to worry about being checked.\u201d",

      "The designated survivor for a president's address to Congress starts the day as a Cabinet secretary and ends it that way, too, God willing",
      "WASHINGTON -- They start the day often as low-profile Cabinet secretaries. They end it that way, too, God willing.",
      "But, when the rest of the government is gathered together for a big event, like President Donald Trump 's joint congressional address Tuesday night, a designated survivor is kept away to ensure someone in the line of presidential succession stays alive.",
      "Picking a failsafe in case of a cataclysmic event that wipes out everyone else dates back to the Cold War. It's been dramatized in novels and an ABC series starring Kiefer Sutherland that aired from 2016 to 2019.",
      "Being the actual designated survivor brings extra adrenaline jolts and humbling thoughts about being unwittingly catapulted into the presidency and unthinkable tragedy \u2014 though the minute-to-minute details usually don't feature the high drama of fictional portrayals, those who have filled the role say.",
      "\u201cIt focuses your mind. It also enhances your prayer that it doesn\u2019t happen to you,\u201d James Nicholson, who was President George W. Bush's veterans affairs secretary and designated survivor during the 2006 State of the Union, said of possibly becoming president after a cataclysmic event.",
      "Trump\u2019s White House hasn\u2019t said who will be the designated survivor choice Tuesday. Historian and journalist Garrett M. Graff said the concept of designated survivor has long captivated people because it combines the public's inherent fascination with danger and the romance of an \u201ceveryman\u201d being thrust into the presidency.",
      "\u201cThe idea of, you\u2019re just a random Cabinet official, and then something terrible happens and, all of a sudden, you\u2019re president of the United States,\" said Graff, author of \u201cRaven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government\u2019s Secret Plan to Save Itself \u2014 While the Rest of Us Die.\u201d",
      "Until the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, designated survivors had more control over where they went outside Washington. President Bill Clinton's energy secretary, the late Bill Richardson, was picked in 2000 and simply moved up a planned weekend trip with his wife to Oxford, Maryland, a waterfront town about 80 miles away, so he'd be there during the State of the Union.",
      "When Dan Glickman, Clinton\u2019s agriculture secretary, was tapped during the 1997 State of the Union, his hometown of Wichita, Kansas, was too far away, so he chose New York, where his daughter lived.",
      "\u201cI thought it was kind of exciting. But I wasn\u2019t hyped up from a dangerous perspective,\u201d Glickman said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think anybody told me to be careful.\u201d",
      "Alberto Gonzales, Bush's attorney general, was the designated survivor during the 2007 State of the Union. He said White House chief of staff Josh Bolten called a few days before and gave a couple of options for where he could hunker down.",
      "Gonzales chose to be in flight, and he arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to find \u201cmembers of every major department and agency\u201d there to ride with him. They carried thick binders stuffed with memos and protocol instructions, just in case.",
      "He said there were a series of briefings that may have stretched right into Bush's speech, which he watched from the air.",
      "\u201cIt was during that time that it sort of suddenly hit me, if something happened in the Capitol and everyone's killed, that I'd be president,\u201d Gonzales said. \"It's sort of sobering. And you wonder, would I be up to governing a wounded nation?\u201d",
      "In \u201cRaven Rock,\u201d Graff details how the designated survivor concept was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations amid fears that Soviet subs just off the Atlantic Coast could fire nuclear missiles and wipe out Washington with barely 10 minutes\u2019 warning.",
      "Beginning in April 1980, the White House Military Office tasked the Federal Emergency Management Agency with ensuring succession. An aide was directed to recommend to the president who should skip events when all possible successors were together outside the White House.",
      "Officials still prepare for a massive attack or disaster. The military helicopter that collided with a regional jet outside Reagan National Airport in January was on a continuity of government mission \u2014 training to keep the federal government functioning in case of catastrophe.",
      "The first time that a Cabinet member being kept away from a presidential speech to Congress was publicly divulged was President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Education Secretary Terrel Bell in 1981. But Bell wasn\u2019t identified until afterward.",
      "Today, TV images from the House chamber allow political junkies to spot the missing Cabinet member within minutes.",
      "Nicholson said Bush\u2019s then-chief of staff, Andy Card, had asked him a few weeks before the State of the Union to take on the role. He was a natural fit given that his agency played an important role in continuity of government exercises due to its numerous hospitals and clinics nationwide.",
      "Nicholson flew by helicopter to a destination only divulged once he was in the air, and later sat in a command center, where he underwent briefings before watching Bush\u2019s speech.",
      "He was served a \u201cwonderful\u201d dinner, prepared onsite by personnel from the White House mess, though he can't recall if it was T-bone steak or prime rib or something similar. \u201cIt made you think that, at least, if this awful thing happened, you\u2019d be well fed,\" he said.",
      "\u201cThe enormity of that job. You think about, remote as it is, this is something you might have to do,\u201d he said of becoming president. Nicholson's wife was attending the State of the Union, meaning that if something happened, she could be among the victims, which only added to the pressure.",
      "When it was over, Nicholson wasn't asked to fill in his predecessor in the role, Gonzales, or future designated survivors.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a club,\u201d he laughed. \"We should.\u201d",
      "Glickman recalls boarding an Air Force G-3 from Andrews along with Secret Service agents, a military official and a series of advisers not on his usual staff. A three-car motorcade later carried him from LaGuardia Airport to his daughter's apartment near Union Square in Manhattan.",
      "She wanted to invite others to watch the speech with them, but Glickman nixed that. \u201cThis was not a party,\" he said.",
      "It wasn't all serious, though. Glickman said he was told he didn't need to dress up, so he didn't wear a suit. Instructions not to study up spared him from reading briefing books or memorizing security protocols.",
      "After the speech, the Secret Service asked if Glickman wanted a ride to the airport. He declined, saying he planned to have dinner with his daughter. It was sleeting when the motorcade left without him, making taxis scarce and the sudden return to real life especially abrupt.",
      "\u201cI was the most powerful man on the face of the earth, theoretically,\" Glickman remembered joking to his daughter. \"And then I can't even get a cab.\u201d",

      "The Florida panther, which is similar to but smaller than the Western cougar or mountain lion, once roamed across a large swath of the southeastern U.S. Hunting and habitat loss have decimated the species' numbers and confined them to a shrinking space of about 2 million acres (809,000 hectares), according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "Indeed, along what were once narrow country roads in eastern Collier and Lee counties there are numerous major projects under way that will create tens of thousands of homes and the traffic that comes with them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at a critical juncture now,\u201d said Michael McGrath of the Sierra Club, which recently led a tour of panther country for journalists and activists. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more and more deaths. Sprawl kills.\u201d",

      "The Florida panther is the only established population of pumas east of the Mississippi River, according to the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. They have been listed as federally endangered since 1967. A 26,600-acre (10,700-hectare) panther refuge was established in 1989 next to the Big Cypress National Preserve, west of the Everglades.",
      "In 1981, the state began capturing panthers to check their health, administer vaccines, take genetic samples and fit them with radio collars to track them.",
      "The panther population at one point in the 1990s dropped to around 50 animals, in part because of inbreeding that caused numerous health problems. That led officials to import eight female Texas pumas to Florida to breed with males, helping boost panther numbers and improving their genetic diversity. The offspring are considered to be Florida panthers and are protected under the Endangered Species Act, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "Florida panthers resemble the cougars and pumas found in the American West, with beige or tan fur and white markings underneath. They eat various types of prey, especially deer and raccoons.",
      "Males tend to roam more than females in search of territory and sometimes are spotted near the Orlando area. One male was shot and killed by a hunter in Georgia in 2008, wildlife officials say. Because males roam more, they are more prone to being struck by vehicles.",
      "Panthers face the threat of disease, including a form of feline leukemia transmitted to them by domestic cats. Bobcats also are prone to the disease.",
      "A 2002 outbreak of feline leukemia killed at least five panthers, federal wildlife officials say.",
      "Another emerging disease appears to cause weakness in the rear legs of panthers and bobcats, many of them seen walking unsteadily on trail video cameras.",
      "\"We encourage the public to continue to submit footage and pictures of wildlife that appear to have problems with their rear legs,\u201d the Florida wildlife commission said in an online post.",
      "Some are killed through fights among themselves, especially males.",

      "Actor Gene Hackman and his wife made Santa Fe their home decades ago",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The pi\u00f1on- and juniper-scented Rocky Mountain foothills overlooking Santa Fe have helped the city earn a reputation as a refuge for famous actors and authors seeking to escape the spotlight.",
      "Sometimes the world's attention is unavoidable, as it was this week when Oscar-winner Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead inside their home in those very foothills.",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, eschewed fame and made Santa Fe their home decades ago, like many other acclaimed artists, including the former playwright Sam Shepard, actors Shirley MacLaine and Ali MacGraw, and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "In addition to the fresh air and mountain vistas, Santa Fe \u2014 situated more than a mile above sea level \u2014 is known for Pueblo-style architecture, Southwest-themed art galleries and turquoise jewelry-filled boutiques. Initially settled by Indigenous people and once colonized by Spain, the capital city of New Mexico today embraces a low-key vibe where young skateboarders share the sidewalks with wealthy retirees decked out in Pendleton cardigans and cowboy boots.",
      "It's not uncommon to see a famous person strolling downtown, dining out or hiking on the numerous trails; it's just that locals know not to gush over them.",
      "\"You recognize that celebrities who come here are coming here for the same reason. They just want to live and be normal people,\u201d artist Kristin Bortles said, taking a break from planning a mural for a new coffee shop.",
      "The normally laid back city was in collective shock Thursday as news spread about Hackman and Arakawa. The last time a crush of media descended on Santa Fe was when Alec Baldwin shot and killed a cinematographer on the set of the movie \u201cRust.\u201d",
      "On Friday, conversations about what had happened to Hackman and his wife always came back to Santa Fe's reputation as a place where celebrities could unwind and live unassuming lives far from the glitz of Los Angeles or New York City \u2014 and even some of the more glamorous Rocky Mountain enclaves, like Vail, Colorado.",
      "Hackman retired in the early 2000s after a decades-long career that included roles as villains, heroes and antiheroes in dozens of dramas, comedies and action films. Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen on the Hollywood social circuit.",
      "He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe and wrote a novel about the American West centered on New Mexico called \u201cPayback at Morning Peak\u201d and coauthored one on the Civil War entitled \u201cEscape from Andersonville.\" (A real life battle took place just east of Santa Fe in 1862, at Glorieta Pass.)",
      "Hackman and Arakawa lived in a multilevel Pueblo-style home that blends in with the surrounding geography. He enjoyed weekly Pilates classes, bicycle rides along paved trails and getting fresh eggs dropped off by friends.",
      "While Hackman kept a tight circle of friends and didn't go out much, he was sometimes spotted downtown. But one of the most accomplished actors of his generation mostly blended in.",
      "\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve learned about Santa Fe is that you never know who you\u2019re talking to, you never know who you\u2019re going to meet or who\u2019s around the corner,\u201d said Gabriel Garcia, whose family has been selling jewelry and leather crafts on the Santa Fe Plaza for more than 60 years.",
      "Hackman usually was in jeans, a flannel shirt and sometimes a baseball cap, said friend Stuart Ashman, the former head of the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs and past CEO of the International Folk Art Market.",
      "\u201cObviously he was a huge star,\" Ashman said, \"but you would never know it when you talked to him because he had that sort of what I call a princely attitude, where he\u2019s focused on you and asks you about you, not talking about himself.\u201d",
      "Hackman enjoyed painting and was drawn to the beauty of the hills surrounding Santa Fe and the light of the high desert, Ashman said.",
      "Arakawa, a classical musician, was soft spoken and never one to expect special treatment, said Larry Keller, owner of a high-end furniture and art store where she would shop.",
      "Being a part of the Santa Fe community, he said, means not drawing extra attention to someone because of their celebrity status.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re too cool for school, you know. That\u2019s the Santa Fe vibe,\u201d Keller said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Furious Democrats filled Republican town halls across America last week to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s power grab in Washington.",
      "But in recent days, the activists behind those protests have turned their anger toward elected officials in their own party, who they believe are not fighting the Republican president and billionaire adviser Elon Musk with the urgency, aggression or creativity that the moment deserves.",
      "\u201cAre we in a constitutional crisis or not?\u201d said Ezra Levin, co-founder of the anti-Trump resistance group Indivisible, which encouraged progressives to attend town halls and protest outside Tesla dealerships.",
      "Of Democratic leaders, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s zero tactical or innovative leadership.\u201d",
      "Indeed, as Trump moves to consolidate control in Washington with little regard for precedent or judges ruling against him, the nation's most powerful Democrats are offering mixed messages while struggling to break from the rules and norms that have long governed U.S. politics.",
      "Key Democratic governors have spoken out with varying levels of concern, but they have also promised to work with the Trump administration to ensure resources flow to their states.",
      "House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has taken heat for spending part of last week's congressional recess promoting a children's book he wrote about democracy. Asked about activists' frustration, he pointed to his party's united opposition to the GOP budget bill and to the more than 100 lawsuits brought against the president.",
      "\u201cWe have to continue to push back aggressively in every way possible in defense of the American people,\" Jeffries insisted, acknowledging voters' \u201cconcern, fear, shock and anxiety.\u201d",
      "Republicans have control of the House and Senate. Some Democrats think they are nearing the limit of what they can do to stop Trump, and so the party should stand back.",
      "Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville said as much out loud earlier in the week in a New York Times opinion piece in which he encouraged his party to embrace a \u201cstrategic retreat\u201d to let Trump and his Republican allies take the blame for the chaos they create.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead,\u201d Carville wrote.",
      "The piece infuriated Democratic activists. But some officials in Washington quietly welcomed Carville\u2019s call for Democrats to get out of Trump\u2019s way.",
      "\u201cThe Carville point was that there\u2019s got to be an opportunity for people to start experiencing and coming to their own conclusion,\u201d said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s easier said than done on Carville is that people are freaked out and they do want us to do something and we want to do something,\u201d Welch added. \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma.\u201d",
      "In Trump's first month in office, he and Musk have moved with extraordinary speed to cut tens of thousands of jobs from the federal workforce. The president is trying to eliminate entire agencies established by federal law. He has signed dozens of executive orders and begun to exact retribution against perceived political enemies across the government, firing independent inspectors general, federal prosecutors and FBI agents involved with his previous prosecutions.",
      "Trump and his allies have lashed out against judges and threatened to defy court rulings.",
      "So far, neither Jeffries nor Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York has been willing to employ perhaps the most dramatic tool at their disposal to stop Trump: their vote \u2014 and the ability to withhold their vote in protest \u2014 even if it means shutting down the government.",
      "There are some Democrats who want their party to pursue a shutdown on March 14 when current funding expires. But historically, shutdowns have been a Republican strategy only. Democrats generally see themselves as the political grown-ups in the room.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Democrats \u201cneed to be more imaginative and ingenious and aggressive in our tactics.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut that should not mean that we depart from basic values,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cCourt orders should be obeyed. We have to respect the rule of law. But we also have to be more nimble and agile in the tactics and tools we use, and be exhaustive in every legal means of fighting back.\u201d",
      "Democratic governors \u2014 and 2028 presidential prospects \u2014 have spoken out with varying levels of concern.",
      "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer dined at the White House with Trump last week as part of the National Governors Association annual meeting. Afterward, she told Michigan media that she continues to look for \u201ccommon ground\u201d with the president.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who this past week announced a new podcast featuring Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d allies, has softened his stance on Trump in an effort to ensure the Republican administration doesn\u2019t block disaster funding for the state\u2019s devastating wildfires.",
      "Whitmer and Newsom have also been sharply critical of Trump throughout their careers. At the same time, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker used his recent State of the State address to liken Trump\u2019s power grabs to the conditions that preceded the Holocaust.",
      "\u201cIt took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,\u201d Pritzker charged. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.\u201d",
      "Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, took to the Senate floor last week to call on his colleagues to \u201cwake up.\u201d In a subsequent interview, King described what he called Trump\u2019s \u201cassault on the Constitution \u2014 the most serious in the history of the country.\u201d",
      "The senator said Democrats cannot simply assume that the courts will rein in Trump. But he also acknowledged that they had relatively few tools to push back as the minority party in both chambers of Congress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory. There\u2019s no playbook for this,\u201d King said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to figure out what\u2019s effective.\u201d",
      "The Democratic base is not in a patient mood.",
      "Lori Goldman, who leads the Michigan-based activist group known as Fems for Dems, was enraged when asked for her assessment of Democratic leaders.",

      "Klein, of Indivisible, is growing increasingly pessimistic that Democratic leaders in Congress are listening even after his group took credit for town halls that shaped the debate on Capitol Hill.",
      "\u201cI was hopeful that they were coming over to our side to lead the opposition, and in the absence of that, I think you\u2019re going to just see distance between them and their own constituents grow and grow and grow,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t have positive consequences.\u201d",

      "The sudden blowup was the most heated public exchange of words between world leaders in the Oval Office in memory, as the usual staid work of diplomacy descended into finger-pointing, shouting and eye-rolling.",
      "The encounter left the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv\u2019s ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia, in mortal jeopardy.",
      "\u201cYou either make a deal or we are out,\u201d Trump told Zelenskyy, underscoring the American leader\u2019s plans to dictate a swift end to the war or leave its longtime ally to continue the fight without its strongest backer.",
      "The stunning episode capped a week of what turned out to be largely futile efforts by U.S. allies to paper over differences between Washington and Kyiv and to try to steer Trump away from his flirtations with Moscow.",
      "On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron huddled with Trump to lay the groundwork for an eventual European-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine aimed at deterring future Russian aggression and to encourage the U.S. president to be more skeptical of Vladimir Putin.",
      "But even as Trump and Macron greeted each other with a vise-like grip, the U.S. was splitting with its European allies at the United Nations by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in a series of resolutions marking the three-year anniversary of the war.",
      "On Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited Washington and appealed to Trump for a U.S. \u201cbackstop\u201d for European nations who would provide front-line security for Ukraine. He was in essence looking for insurance that, should a peace deal be reached, Russia won\u2019t restart the fighting in the future. Starmer brought flattery and a state visit invitation from King Charles III to soften the ask.",
      "The approach seemed to work, as Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward Ukraine, calling America\u2019s support for the country against Russia\u2019s invasion \u201ca very worthy thing to do\u201d and disclaiming any memory that he had called the Ukrainian leader a \u201cdictator.\u201d",
      "But Trump also brushed aside Putin\u2019s past broken diplomatic promises, claiming they occurred under different presidents, and saying the Russian leader had never violated a commitment to him. It came as his aides were planning a series of negotiating sessions with Russian officials to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Trump and Putin in the coming weeks.",
      "All the while, Trump was focused on securing a financial stake in Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals to recoup the tens of billions the U.S. has given to Kyiv to defend itself. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, wanted more than Washington\u2019s vague promises that the U.S. would work to preserve its economic interest in Ukraine under the agreement and pushed for more concrete security guarantees.",
      "But Trump would not budge, and U.S. officials repeatedly said Zelenskyy would not be welcome to meet with the president to discuss Trump\u2019s push for negotiations with Russia until it was signed. After weeks of browbeating, Zelenskyy\u2019s government on Wednesday formally agreed to the proposal, clearing the path for Friday\u2019s meeting.",
      "It started off cordially enough, as Trump and Zelenskyy spoke politely, even with admiration, of one of another for the first half-hour of the meeting. Trump even suggested he would continue some military assistance to Ukraine until he could secure an enduring peace deal with Russia.",
      "But when the Ukrainian leader raised alarm about trusting any promises from Putin to end the fighting, Vice President JD Vance rebuked him for airing disagreements with Trump in public. It instantly shifted the tenor of the conversation. Zelenskyy grew defensive, and Trump and his vice president blasted him as ungrateful and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and issued stark warnings about future American support.",
      "South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, both a defense hawk and a strident ally of Trump\u2019s, said he had warned Zelenskyy ahead of the meeting \u201cnot to take the bait\u201d in his dealings with Trump, who has repeatedly shown a penchant for throwing criticism but a deep resistance to receiving it.",
      "It was Vance \u2014 a longtime critic of American support for Ukraine \u2014 who dangled it, when he insisted diplomacy was the only pathway forward.",
      "\u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\u201d Zelenskyy said, listing Russia\u2019s past violations of ceasefires. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m talking about the kind of diplomacy that\u2019s going to end the destruction of your country,\u201d Vance responded before tearing into the Ukrainian leader. \u201cMr. President, with respect, I think it\u2019s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\u201d",
      "Trump then let loose, warning the Ukrainian leader, \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you\u2019re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that\u2019s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\u201d",
      "At another point, Trump declared himself \u201cin the middle,\u201d seeming to formally break from years of American support for Ukraine. He went on to deride Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201chatred\u201d for Putin as a roadblock to peace.",
      "\u201cYou see the hatred he\u2019s got for Putin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\u201d Trump said to Zelenskyy as the two leaders talked over each other.",
      "The episode was just the latest instance of Trump's brazen moves to shift long-held American policy positions in his first six weeks back in office, portending even more uncertainty ahead for longtime American allies and partners who have already felt pressed to justify their place in Trump's eyes. It comes just weeks after Trump floated a permanent relocation of Palestinians in Gaza and an American takeover of the territory, and as he has doubled down on plans to put stiff tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada starting next week.",
      "After the Oval Office dustup, Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House by top Trump advisers \u2014 scrapping plans for a lunch, a joint press conference and the signing of the economic agreement, even as the Ukrainian leader and his aides pushed for a \u201creset\u201d on the meeting.",
      "Trump later told reporters he didn\u2019t want to \u201cembolden\u201d the Ukrainian leader if he didn\u2019t want \u201cpeace\u201d with Russia \u2014 flipping what Ukraine had seen as an inducement for security guarantees into a cudgel.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t embolden somebody who does not have the cards,\u201d Trump said.",
      "After the disastrous encounter, Zelenskyy appeared on Fox News on Friday evening and told Bret Baier that his public spat with Trump and Vance was \u201cnot good for both sides.\u201d But Zelenskyy said Trump \u2014 who insists Putin is ready to end the three-year grinding war \u2014 needs to understand that Ukraine can\u2019t change its attitudes toward Russia on a dime.",
      "Zelenskyy added that Ukraine won\u2019t enter peace talks with Russia until it has security guarantees against another offensive.",
      "\u201cEverybody (is) afraid Putin will come back tomorrow,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cWe want just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so sensitive for our people,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cAnd they just want to hear that America (is) on our side, that America will stay with us. Not with Russia, with us. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy acknowledged that without U.S. support, his country\u2019s position would grow \u201cdifficult.\u201d",
      "After repeatedly declining opportunities to apologize to Trump, Zelensky closed his Fox appearance with a sheepish expression of remorse as he struggled with the reality of Trump's new direction in Washington: \u201cSorry for this.\""

      "The graves of hundreds of African American tenant farmers and their families are being moved in Virginia to make way for an industrial park",
      "DANVILLE, Va. -- A decision to move the remains of hundreds African American tenant farmers from a former Virginia tobacco plantation to a dedicated burial ground has elicited a range of emotions among the sharecroppers\u2019 descendants.",
      "Some worry about the implications of disturbing the graves of people who were exploited and enslaved. Others hope the remains can be identified and reburied with more respect than they were afforded in life.",
      "The mostly unidentified remains are being moved from a site that had been part of one of the nation\u2019s largest slave-owning operations, to make way for an industrial park.",
      "When they were buried they weren't considered fully human, but now they are \u201cpatriots who are coming out of their graves with equal rights in 2025,\u201d one descendant, Cedric Hairston, said.",
      "Archaeologists have already started exhuming the approximately 275 plots, and some of the remains of tenant farmers and their families are already in a funeral home but will be moved to the new burial site about a mile away. Officials have been consulting with descendants about genetic testing on unidentified remains as well as designs for the new cemetery, including a memorial archway.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would want their ancestors exhumed or moved,\u201d said Jeff Bennett, whose great-great-great grandfather was buried at the plantation. \u201cBut for them to give us a lot of say so in the new cemetery, down to the design details and the plaques and memorials that we put up, I feel like (they\u2019re) really doing it in a dignified way, in a respectful way.\u201d",
      "African American cemeteries have suffered neglect, abandonment and destruction over the centuries. But efforts to preserve them are gaining momentum, with communities unearthingand rebuilding these crucial links to past generations.",
      "While generally supportive of the project to move the graves, Hairston worries about the indignity of exhuming the graves of people who were brutalized as slaves and exploited as sharecroppers.",
      "\u201cIt just seems that 100 or so odd years after their death, there\u2019s still no rest,\u201d he said.",
      "Oak Hill was part of a family empire that enslaved thousands of people across 45 plantations and farms in four states, according to \u201cThe Hairstons,\u201d a 1999 book by Henry Wiencek that chronicles the Black and white Hairston families.",
      "Samuel Hairston, the plantation's owner, was reputedly the largest enslaver in the South, Wiencek wrote.",
      "But the grand property has stood mostly empty and unused since sharecropping ended last century. The 1820s plantation house was destroyed by fire in 1988.",
      "Many who were enslaved at Oak Hill left after emancipation, Wiencek wrote. Those who remained as tenant farmers were often cheated of wages and faced crushing poverty and sometimes violence in the Jim Crow South.",
      "Some tenant farmers took the Hairston surname, in part because \u201cwe had no other name to identify with, as the government was collecting data for the census. We brought no last name with us from Africa,\u201d Cedric Hairston said, adding, \u201cMany of our women carried and birthed a Hairston child, never with the support of the law to report that they were raped.\u201d",
      "One of the sharecroppers was Fleming Adams Sr., Bennett\u2019s great-great-great grandfather. Known as \u201cFlem,\u201d he was born into slavery on another plantation in 1830. He later worked at Oak Hill, where he had to duck through doorways because he was so tall, Bennett said.",
      "Adams and his wife Martha raised three sons \u2014 George, Daniel and Flem Jr. \u2014 before he died in 1916. His death certificate lists his burial place as Oak Hill.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that we can discover where Flem is,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe was 7 feet tall, so they\u2019d be looking for a bigger coffin. And hopefully there\u2019d be enough of his remains where they could do a DNA sample.\u201d",
      "Most of the graves in the two secluded sharecropper cemeteries were marked only by moss-covered stones without inscriptions. Rows of depressions in the earth showed where the wooden coffins had collapsed below. Needles from loblolly pines covered many of the plots.",
      "A public entity, the Pittsylvania-Danville Regional Industrial Facility Authority, acquired 3,500 acres (1,400 hectares) of land that included the former Oak Hill plantation, and Tennessee-based Microporous announced in November it would build a $1.3 billion battery production facility there. It expects to create 2,000 jobs.",
      "Virginia's Department of Historical Resources granted a permit in late November to move the graves, noting that relocation is consistent with the desires of the descendant families. Bennett and others visited the sites in December.",
      "Silence fell as they walked into the first cemetery. J.D. Adams, an Oak Hill descendant, said a historical marker must be placed there.",
      "\u201cWe need some time in order to determine what it is we want and how we want it,\u201d Adams told Matt Rowe, Pittsylvania County\u2019s economic development director.",
      "Rowe replied: \u201cI\u2019m open to anything and everything.\u201d",
      "The industrial authority has raised $1.3 million from logging the land to fund the project, which is being handled by engineering and consulting company WSP.",
      "WSP's archaeologist, John Bedell, said everything would be collected from each grave shaft, even if it is mostly soil, and transferred to its new space, including the stone that marked it.",
      "The firm hopes to finish transferring the graves by early March. Work on the new burial site and a dedication ceremony will follow in the coming months.",
      "Bennett and others recently viewed personal items found in the graves. Protected in plastic bags, they included eyeglasses, a medicine bottle and a 5-cent coin from 1836. One man was buried with a light bulb, socket and electrical cord. Another man's grave was lined with bricks, indicating he was wealthy, Bennet said.",
      "Those bricks will be repurposed at the new burial site, possibly in the memorial archway, and inscribed with the names of the deceased, he said.",
      "Descendants are reviewing funeral home records to try to identify those buried in unmarked graves. Given the challenging nature of the task, they may inscribe the names of everyone who lived in the area.",
      "\u201cI feel like we're reemphasizing the significance of our ancestors,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt's been generations since people used that area to bury people. And now we're rediscovering their stories. And hopefully we can continue to tell those stories to the next generations.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- The American Civil Liberties Union is seeking to represent two restaurant workers in a gender identity discrimination lawsuit after a U.S. agency that enforces civil rights laws filed to drop the case in response to President Donald Trump's recent executive order targeting transgender people.",
      "The lawsuit against a Culver\u2019s restaurant in Clarkston, Michigan, is one of seven cases involving gender identity discrimination the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed to dismiss. The EEOC has argued in court filings that pursuing the lawsuits conflicts with Trump's executive order, which declared that the government would only recognize the female and male sexes and ordered federal agencies to take steps to comply.",
      "The EEOC sought to dismiss the lawsuit against Culver's on Monday just four months after filed it following a yearslong investigation. EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas declined to comment on the seven cases the agency is seeking to drop, but in a statement to The Associated Press, she said the EEOC, as an agency of the executive branch, will \u201crobustly will comply with the President\u2019s executive orders.\u201d",
      "The original lawsuit alleges that Culver's fired a transgender man, Asher Lucas, and two female employees, Regina Zaviski and Savannah Nurme-Robinson, after they repeatedly complained to managers that another employee had been harassing and misgendering Lucas. The lawsuit says that managers warned the employee about her behavior but when Lucas, Zaviski and Nurme-Robinson complained that the harassment did not stop, all three were fired.",
      "The ACLU filed a motion to intervene on behalf of Zaviski and Nurme-Robinson on Thursday while Lucas had previously decided to pursue the lawsuit on his own.",
      "\u201cIf this administration does not want to protect the rights of transgender people and their allies, we want them to know that we will,\u201d said Syeda Davidson, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan.",
      "An attorney representing Culver's in the lawsuit did not immediately return an email seeking comment. In court filings, the defendants have denied allegations of discrimination.",
      "Lucas had already filed a motion to intervene \u2014 or pursue his own lawsuit \u2014 in November out of fear that the EEOC would no longer advocate on his behalf after Trump won the presidential election, according his attorney, Angela Mannarino.",
      "Lucas, 21, told The AP that he has kept pursuing his case over the years because he wants to stand up for transgender people and make sure they don't go through what he did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad to be the person who can be able to do that,\u201d he said.",
      "The EEOC's decisions to abandon the seven lawsuits signaled a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law.",
      "Last year, the EEOC updated its guidance to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment. That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Nearly all workplace discrimination charges must pass through the EEOC at least initially. After a lengthy process, workers can seek the right pursue lawsuits on their own from the EEOC but that means they must shoulder the cost of litigation on their own and are deprived of the agency's investigative resources.",
      "Lucas, the acting chair, announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be \u201cdefending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\u201d Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that \u201cimplicate\u201d Trump\u2019s order should be elevated to headquarters for \u201creview.\u201d",
      "In fiscal year 2023, the agency received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.",

      "Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and House Speaker Dustin Burrows, who are all Republicans, later issued statements of support for Stepney and her service, while other GOP lawmakers criticized Harrison over the exchange.",

      "\u201cIt was a deep honor for me to be appointed to the board, to be confirmed by the board, and to be appointed chair,\u201d she said. \"I have always been grateful to the governor. What have I done? I have protected the drinking water supply of 31 million Texans.\""

      "Abdisatar Ahmed Hassan, 22, made his first court appearance on a charge of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He was ordered held without bail until a detention hearing March 5.",
      "The chief federal defender for Minnesota, Katherian Roe, said her office will represent him but declined to comment on the case.",
      "The criminal complaint against Hassan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, alleges that he tried twice in December to travel from Minnesota to Somalia to join the group but did not succeed. It says he claimed he was going to visit family but had none there.",
      "Prosecutors said the FBI\u2019s investigation established that Hassan expressed public support for the group in multiple posts on social media and also praised Shamsud-Din Jabbar on TikTok over the New Orleans attack.",
      "Investigators say Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texas native and U.S. Army veteran, posted videos professing allegiance to the Islamic State group and an intent to harm others before he plowed a pickup through a crowd of New Year\u2019s revelers on Bourbon Street on Jan. 1. Police fatally shot him during an exchange of gunfire at the scene.",

      "The charging documents also say police in New York notified the FBI last May that Hassan had made social media posts in support of the Somali group al-Shabab. An affidavit from an agent says investigators spotted al-Shabab and Islamic State group propaganda videos on his TikTok and Facebook accounts. It also alleges that he exchanged messages with a Facebook account that encourages Somali-speaking individuals to travel and fight on behalf of the Islamic State group.",

      "Hassan is the latest of several Minnesotans suspected of leaving or trying to leave the U.S. to join the Islamic State group in recent years, along with thousands of fighters from other countries. In 2016 nine Minnesota men were sentenced on federal charges of conspiring to join the group, and a Minnesotan who actually fought for the group in Iraq was sentenced last June to 10 years in prison."

      "Thanks to a lack of snow, this year's edition of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race needed a new route across the Alaska wilderness. The course change adds more than 100 miles (161 kilometers), so teams of dogs will have to pull their mushers over 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) to the finish line.",
      "The number of mushers participating this year is down from previous years, and tied with 2023 as an all-time low. This year is the fourth time the starting line has moved to Fairbanks due to barren ground near Anchorage or elsewhere on the trail.",
      "Here's a by-the-numbers look at the grueling event, which begins with a ceremonial start in Anchorage on Saturday, followed by the start of the race in Fairbanks on Monday. The winning team is expected in the Gold Rush town of Nome about 10 days later.",
      "Only 33 mushers will start this year\u2019s race, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever.",
      "The largest field ever was 96 mushers in 2008.",
      "This drop in participants raises concerns about the viability of the iconic race, which has suffered from inflation, pressure from animal rights groups and climate change.",

      "The inaugural event had 34 mushers start the race, only one more than the smallest fields in 2023 and 2025.",
      "Sled dogs were once the main form of transportation in Alaska. Dog teams hauled freight, brought people to other villages and even provided transport for the Alaska Territorial Guard, or the famed Eskimo Scouts, which patrolled the western coast against Japanese attack in World War II.",
      "Dog teams were supplanted by snowmobiles in the 1960s, but interest was growing to honor Alaska\u2019s traditions as the 100th anniversary of its purchase by the U.S. from Russia neared in 1967.",
      "Dorothy Page and Joe Redington Sr. conceived the idea of a long-distance race to honor the Iditarod Trail, a freight-and-mail route from Seward to Nome, which eventually led to the first Iditarod.",
      "This year the Iditarod will honor another famous route: the 1925 Serum Run, in which sled dog teams saved Nome from a deadly diphtheria outbreak.",
      "That\u2019s a lot of dogs.",
      "Each musher must have at least a dozen dogs to start the race, but throughout the course, they can have up to 16, meaning there could be up to 528 canines on the trail.",
      "It won\u2019t be that crowded in Anchorage, however. Mushers are limited to eight dogs each for the ceremonial start, or a total of 264 tail-waggers.",
      "The Iditarod is typically called a 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race as mushers and their dogs battle the most challenging elements an Alaska winter can throw at them.",
      "However, that mileage has always been approximate.",
      "Organizers alternate between different routes most years to allow more villages in rural Alaska to serve as checkpoints. In odd-numbered years, the race goes 998 miles (1,606 kilometers) along the southern route. In even-numbered years, the race\u2019s mileage drops to 975 miles (1,569 kilometers) on the northern route.",
      "This year's event will set a record for the longest Iditarod: 1,128 miles (1,815 kilometers). Organizers had to reroute competitors around a stretch of trail without snow.",
      "A lack of snow this winter in the state's largest city also has curtailed the ceremonial start. Usually the teams course through 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) of Anchorage streets. This year, it's less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers).",
      "The Iditarod\u2019s four-legged athletes will go through a total of about 100,000 booties during the race. They help protect the dogs\u2019 paws from snow, ice and frigid temperatures.",
      "Mushers pack supplies they will need during the race but can't carry. The supplies, including about 180,000 pounds (81,647 kilograms) of dog food, are delivered to checkpoints ahead of the race."

      "The lawsuit filed late Friday night seeks to reinstate humanitarian parole programs that allowed in 875,000 migrants from Ukraine, Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who have legal U.S. resident as sponsors.",
      "President Donald Trump has been ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the U.S. and implementing campaign promises to deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The plaintiffs include eight immigrants who entered the U.S. legally before the Trump administration ended what it called the \u201cbroad abuse\u201d of humanitarian parole. They can legally stay in the U.S. until their parole expires, but the administration stopped processing their applications for asylum, visas and other requests that might allow them to remain longer.",
      "None are identified by their real names because they fear deportation. Among them are Maksym and Maria Doe, a Ukrainian couple; Alejandro Doe, who fled Nicaragua following the abduction and torture of his father; and Omar Doe, who worked for more than 18 years with the U.S. military in his home country of Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything illegal. They followed the rules,\u201d Kyle Varner, a 40-year-old doctor and real estate investor from Spokane, Washington, who sponsored 79 Venezuelans and is part of the lawsuit, told The Associated Press. \u201cThey have done nothing but work as hard as they can. ... This is just such a grave injustice.\u201d",
      "Almost all of the immigrants sponsored by Varner have lived in his house for some time. He paid their plane tickets. He helped them learn English and get driver\u2019s licenses and jobs. He had 32 applications that were awaiting approval when the Trump administration ended the program in January.",
      "Other plaintiffs include two more U.S. citizens who have sponsored immigrants, Sandra McAnany and Wilhen Pierre Victor, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a California-based organization that assists immigrants with legal advice.",
      "\"The Trump administration is trying to attack parole from all angles,\u201d said Esther Sung, an attorney from the Justice Action Center, which filed the lawsuit with Human Rights First in federal court in Massachusetts and provided the AP a copy in advance. \u201cThe main goal, above all, is to defend humanitarian parole. These have been very, very successful processes.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Parole authority began in 1952 and has been used by Republican and Democratic presidents to admit people unable to use standard immigration routes because of time pressure or because their home country's government lacks diplomatic relations with the U.S.",
      "Under parole, immigrants arrived \u201cfor urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\u201d They are allowed to work while they seek another legal way to stay in the country.",
      "Trump ordered an end to \u201ccategorical parole programs\u201d the day he returned to office.",
      "Joe Biden used parole authority more than any other American president, including for people who arrived using the government's CBP One app. But the lawsuit covers only certain parole programs.",
      "McAnany, a 57-year-old widow from Wisconsin who designs and teaches procurement and soft skills courses, sponsored 17 people from Venezuela and Nicaragua. She still has four pending applications for approval.",
      "McAnany helped them adjust to their new country and find homes and schools. All now work more than 40 hours a week, pay taxes and pay for their health care, she said.",
      "\u201cI care so much about each of the people that I sponsor,\u201d said McAnany. \u201cI can\u2019t just walk away and give up.\u201d"

      "A Mississippi judge has nixed her order that a newspaper remove its editorial criticizing local officials",
      "A Mississippi judge on Wednesday vacated her order that a newspaper remove its editorial criticizing local officials, days after a city decided to drop the lawsuit that spurred it.",
      "The judge's order had been widely condemned by free speech advocates as a clear violation of the paper's First Amendment rights.",
      "Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin had issued the restraining order against the Clarksdale Press Register last week, telling it to remove from its website a Feb. 8 editorial titled \u201cSecrecy, Deception Erode Public Trust.\u201d The piece criticized the city for not sending the newspaper notice about a meeting the board held regarding a proposed tax on alcohol, marijuana and tobacco.",
      "The board of commissioners dropped the suit Monday at the request of Mayor Chuck Espy, who cited an offer from the paper's owner to run a clarification. However, Emmerich Newspapers president Wyatt Emmerich said he made that offer before the city filed its lawsuit and that it was no longer on the table.",
      "Emmerich had offered to clarify that the council said the lack of notification wasn\u2019t a deliberate attempt to hide the meeting, according to a text message Emmerich sent to the city attorney. The text also offered to clarify that a sentence questioning whether there was \u201ckick-back from the community\u201d should have said \u201cpush back.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s lawsuit called the editorial libelous and said it \u201cchilled and hindered\u201d the city\u2019s efforts to lobby for the tax with state legislators. The newspaper and other critics of the ruling said the order was a clear example of prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "The order drew widespread criticism from press groups and free speech advocates around the country, including the National Press Club and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression had agreed to represent the newspaper in court."

Bohmerwald, who was formally charged in October with violating the Export Control Reform Act and other portions of the federal code, entered the plea to a count before U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle in Raleigh.

      "Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.",

      "In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only 6 months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.",
      "Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.",
      "But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three were forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bed bugs crawled through their belongings.",

      "He said his lawyer explained the way Islamic home purchase plans are structured - to comply with Sharia law which does not allow paying interest - means he falls outside the scope of the act.",
      "\"It feels really unfair. I feel like I'm being discriminated against,\" he said.",
      "\"To find out that I'm a non-qualifying leaseholder just because I've got an Islamic home purchase plan is a huge kick in the teeth. It's really upsetting and is a huge let down.\"",
      "The government told the BBC Islamic interest free loans secured against properties were very rare.",

    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",

    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",
      "In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.",
      "Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News.",

      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",

      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",

      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",

      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",

      "However, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\".",
      "The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back.",
      "After taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\".",
      "Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said.",
      "He said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century.",
      "\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union.",
      "He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.",
      "Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"",
      "\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.",
      "\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"",
      "In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\".",
      "Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.",
      "In his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.",

      "The head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".",
      "\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".",
      "He added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK."

      "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.",
      "The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.",
      "The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.",
      "If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.",
      "\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.",

      "The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.",

      "On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".",
      "The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.",
      "An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.",
      "Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".",
      "Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.",
      "It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.",
      "But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.",

      "Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights.",
      "Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.",
      "China's ministry of foreign affairs said it \"strongly\" expressed its \"dissatisfaction and resolute opposition\" to the plans.",
      "Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March.",
      "Trump's comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan.",
      "Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.",
      "He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.",
      "On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.",
      "\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\"",
      "She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\".",
      "Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.",
      "Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.",
      "Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.",
      "China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.",
      "Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.",
      "Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.",
      "A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Lin Jian, said that Trump was using the issue of the drug fentanyl entering the US from China as an \"excuse\" to threaten tariffs, adding it had one of the \"strictest\" drug control policies in the world.",
      "\"Pressure, coercion, and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,\" he said.",
      "Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, had earlier said that his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.",
      "\"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\".",
      "\"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University.",
      "On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.",
      "Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.",
      "Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.",
      "Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.",
      "Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.",
      "\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said.",
      "The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.",
      "But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.",
      "China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.",

      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",

      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",

      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",

      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",

      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",

      "Water bills for households are due to go up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",

      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will go up \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",

      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",

      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",

      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, based on the inflation rate last December, plus an additional charge.",

      "It is removing Advanced Data Protection (ADP) after the Home Office asked for the right to be able to access data which it is applied to - something even Apple itself cannot currently do.",
      "Rather than comply with that request, on Friday the tech giant said it would halt new UK sign-ups to the tool and remove existing user access at a later date.",
      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "Items including back-ups, photos, notes and voice memos are given standard encryption by default.",
      "The company can be ordered to hand over this data by law enforcement.",

      "It also means law enforcement agencies have no way of accessing such data either.",

      "What does this mean for my iCloud data?",
      "If you are in the UK and have not turned on ADP, you will not see a change to the way your data is protected as a result of Apple disabling it.",

      "But it does mean you now cannot apply to protect iCloud storage with end to end encryption, even if you want to.",

      "Apple has not said when, nor how many UK users will be affected.",
      "Some experts have raised alarm over its removal, saying it will leave users less protected and also have wider, global consequences.",
      "Graeme Stewart of cybersecurity firm Check Point said it would not mean \"a complete free-for-all\" as law enforcement must have a warrant to request iCloud data.",
      "But he said other governments may look to replicate the UK's demand of Apple for a so-called \"backdoor\" to encrypted cloud data.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have likened the idea of creating a backdoor to someone leaving their house keys under their doormat - essentially creating a vulnerability which anyone, including bad actors, can exploit.",
      "Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that if Apple had complied with the request, it would have created a backdoor not just for UK users \"but for people around the world, regardless of where they were or what citizenship they had\".",
      "Apple told the BBC in a statement that it had \"never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will\".",
      "What protections do Google and Android offer?",
      "Like Apple, Google says it uses standard encryption across a range of its services to protect data as it moves between users' devices, its services and data centres.",
      "The search giant, which owns Android, has provided further protections for Android phone system back-ups since 2018.",
      "It uses a mechanism that generates a random security key on a device, which is encrypted by a user's lock-screen passcode, pattern or pin.",
      "Google says it cannot see this security key and that the passcode-protected information is sent securely to high security chips in its data centres.",
      "But the same protections do not extend to Google Photos or content stored in Google Drive - which are not end to end encrypted.",
      "It also has an Advanced Protection Program for people who want further security for their account.",
      "This relies on using passkeys to verify the account holder.",

      "Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career.",
      "Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving.",
      "The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.",
      "\"I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,\" says.",
      "A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to \u20ac35,000 ($36,000; \u00a329,000).",
      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",
      "\"Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.",
      "Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.",
      "The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.",
      "Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".",
      "Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.",
      "In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.",
      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",
      "\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".",
      "Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.",
      "According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.",
      "\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.",
      "Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"",
      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",
      "\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"",
      "Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.",
      "Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.",
      "\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"",
      "Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.",
      "\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"",
      "Mr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",

      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",

      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",

    "summary": "The largest producer of maple syrup now wants you to drink the sap, which it calls maple water.",
    "story": [
      "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.",
      "We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.",
      "What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.",
      "A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.",
      "\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.",
      "Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.",
      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",
      "\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"",
      "However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.",
      "Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.",
      "His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.",
      "He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.",
      "\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.",
      "Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.",
      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",
      "Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

      "In England, families are eligible to apply for free school meals if they are on universal credit and have a household income below \u00a37,400 per year, after tax, alongside other benefits.",
      "However, the committee heard evidence from an expert who estimated that one in 10 children in poverty are not receiving the meals.",
      "Earlier this month, Kate Antsey, of the Child Poverty Action Group, told MPs that it was often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process experienced by their parents.",
      "Another estimate published in April 2024 by the think tank Policy in Practice put the number of children needlessly missing out on free school meals at 471,000.",
      "The cross-party education committee said the government should change the current rules using the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - to remove the need for manual enrolment.",
      "Failing to address the issue would be a \"missed opportunity\" to feed hungry children at school, the report concluded.",

      "Some of its proposals - particularly around academies - have been criticised, including by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who called it educational \"vandalism\".",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders' union NAHT, agreed with the committee's calls for auto-enrolment for free school meals, adding: \"Too often social stigma means parents do not register.",
      "\"Crucially, enrolment for free school meals also unlocks pupil premium money for pupils, so without registration they also miss out on this vital additional support.\"",
      "Campaigners say automatic enrolment would also bring in millions in extra funding for schools via pupil premium grants.",
      "The government pays schools \u00a31,455 per primary pupil on free school meals or \u00a31,035 per secondary pupil, per year, for at least six years.",
      "Other recommendations in the report include ensuring that children with special educational needs and disabilities can access universal free breakfast clubs, strengthening the access of children in care to mental health support, and developing a national care offer.",
      "Education committee chairwoman Helen Hayes said: \"The committee has made recommendations designed to strengthen support for the most vulnerable children in society, based on compelling evidence from experts and from young people who shared with us their deeply moving experiences of life in care.\"",
      "The committee called on the government to develop a consistent national offer for care leavers across the country, to support vulnerable young people with things like transport costs and access to apprenticeships.",

      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",
      "The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.",
      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",
      "However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.",
      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",
      "However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.",
      "The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.",
      "\"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said.",
      "He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\".",
      "Following the judgment, he added: \"We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man.\"",

      "In her speech for best dance act, she spoke of the importance of the night-time genre. \"I feel like dance music, electronic music gets a really bad rep' because everyone is like, 'it's not that deep, is it?'. And I kind of feel it is,\" she said.",
      "\"This genre of music for me is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"",

      "\"Culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us - I am living proof that it takes a long time but you don't need to compromise your vision,\" she added.",
      "Sabrina and the beefeater",
      "It's always difficult getting the tone of the opening performance right - but Carpenter certainly nailed the brief with her mash-up of mega-hit Espresso and recent favourite from her best-selling album, Bed Chem.",
      "Fans of the star who have been eagerly following her Short n' Sweet Tour will have recognised some elements of it in her Brits performance - which was given a suitably British update with the opening strains of Rule Britannia and a, ahem, close encounter with a beefeater.",
      "Carpenter also became the first international star to accept the global success award, jokingly saying it was \"an insane honour, for such a tea-drinking country you streamed the [heck] out of espresso.\"",
      "Wearing some lingerie that might have been a little bit too racy for the pre-watershed slot, her performance around a heart-shaped bed was energetic and embodied her cheeky style that has elevated her fame in recent months.",
      "Best pop act winner, Jade - of little mix Fame - attempted to top this with a performance of her song Angel Of My Dreams.",

      "An emerging theme on protecting artists",
      "Several artists used their winning platform to urge the powers-that-be to do more to protect artists and give them the time, space and funds to develop.",
      "Jazz group Ezra Collective - who closed the night with an upbeat performance alongside Jorja Smith - won group of the year, with Femi Koleoso expressing that giving a young person at a youth club a trumpet, for example, could help to fix \"so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK\".",
      "Chappell Roan, who won best international act and international song for Good Luck, Babe!, noted via a video link how she had to write \"a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones\".",
      "Rising star winner Myles Smith - or \"The Luton Bob Dylan\", as host Jack Whitehall called him - performed his hit Stargazing and called on the government to stop treating British music as an \"after thought\" while urging the music industry itself to stick with artists past their first viral hits and tours.",
      "It was also a night that marked the return of Sam Fender, with the Geordie singer-songwriter picking up the best alternative/rock act.",
      "He thanked his band in his speech, saying he would just be a \"mad man shouting at walls\" without them.",
      "It marks the end of a huge week for Fender, who also topped the UK album charts with People Watching - which had the biggest opening week for a British album since Harry Styles' Harry's House in 2022.",

      "Return of the Jack - gags",
      "It's four years since Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards - with Mo Gilligan filling the gap - and he noted how broadcasters ITV \"had to come crawling back to an ex\" in asking him back.",
      "He poked fun at the stars in the audience, underlining how Charli, in true British style, \"had asked not to perform on the show so she can get drunk\".",
      "And referencing Stormzy's recent high profile adverts, he called the star \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald - he's loving it\".",
      "Aiming a light dig at YouTuber KSI, the host joked: \"You are as good a rapper as Aitch... from Steps\".",
      "Having flown over from US filming commitments a few days ago, he showed little signs of jet lag in his bid to \"Make the Brits Great Again\", as he had joked in a pre-show video this week.",
      "\"If you thought Trump-Zelensky was cringe then wait until you hear me...\" he quipped.",
      "It reached peak cringe though when his parents appeared alongside him in one segment, with his dad dressed as Kanye West.",
      "The biggest cheer of the night came when actor Danny Dyer told Whitehall that \"the world is being run by cranks\".",
      "Tributes paid to Liam Payne",
      "Liam Payne, who tragically died in Argentina last October, had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist.",
      "The ceremony included a touching tribute to the star, which was a bit of a gear shift towards the end of the fun-packed show, as Whitehall queued up a sombre black and white montage of Payne's career, including music and quotes from him and his bandmates.",
      "\"I hope that me singing today brings enjoyment to someone,\" he was heard saying.",
      "Seven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa won nothing on the night despite having received four nominations.",

      "Wicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.",
      "US comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).",
      "You can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Here are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.",
      "Which films are in the running?",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).",
      "It is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken.",
      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).",
      "However, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.",
      "Chasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.",
      "Wicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.",
      "Meanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.",
      "All the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "The film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.",
      "But there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.",
      "What else is there to look out for?",
      "This has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.",
      "In the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.",
      "But it's a tight race.",
      "There were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.",
      "Baftas 2025: The winners list in full",
      "Baftas 2025: The winners list in full",
      "It was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.",
      "This is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.",
      "Best actor may also be up in the air. Adrian Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "Last week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.",
      "In the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "10 years since #OscarsSoWhite",
      "It's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.",
      "This year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.",
      "In fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.",
      "Elsewhere, however, progress remains slow.",
      "Coralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.",
      "\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.",
      "\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"",
      "\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"",
      "Which stars are attending?",
      "Most of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.",
      "There had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "Presenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.",
      "What impact have the wildfires had?",
      "This year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.",
      "The nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.",
      "There's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.",
      "Cancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.",
      "She told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.",
      "\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.",
      "Who is performing?",
      "This year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.",
      "Instead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "I can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.",
      "Who is this year's host?",

      "Ralph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.",

      "Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, died alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog at his home in New Mexico. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation. Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February, 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "'He put the fear of God into me'",
      "Here in Los Angeles, Hackman's face is everywhere on television bulletins and on newspapers.",
      "His death was all anyone was talking about as stars gathered for pre-Oscars parties.",
      "At an event on Thursday night, the American actor John C Reilly told me that he expected the Academy to commemorate Hackman on Sunday. \"I don't see how you could have the Oscars without mentioning a great like him who's passed.\"",
      "For Sonnenfeld and for the Irish director John Moore \u2013 who directed Hackman in 2001's Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 it was Hackman's way of dealing with scripts that demonstrated his brilliance. He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"So he had unique cut and pasted scripts that had no information from the writer about anything, because he wanted to make those choices, not the writer.\"",
      "Moore recalls a similar incident from the very first time he filmed with Hackman.",
      "\"He was just quietly sitting there, taking script pages out, cutting them up, removing extraneous stuff like scene descriptions, and then sticking them back onto blank pages,\" he said.",
      "He said Hackman told him: \"Acting is my job, you do the rest.\"",
      "\"It put the fear of God into me,\" Moore said, laughing.",
      "\"It was essentially him saying: 'I don't need anything, as I'm that good. You better bring your A-game, as I'm bringing mine.'\"",
      "It wasn't just superfluous studio notes that bothered Hackman.",
      "\"He had this conflict in that he was this brilliant actor but he hated the tropes of what it took to act in movies,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "\"[He] hated putting on makeup. The putting on of wardrobe. The wardrobe person after takes, taking their lip brush and rubbing down their wardrobe. The makeup person recombing his hair while he's talking to me,\" he said.",
      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",
      "Nor did he often want to socialise after filming, said Moore.",
      "\"I'd try and have a drink with him after we'd shoot, and go up to the minibar,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd have one, that was it. [Betsy] would give him that look, and off it would be to bed. And he was in great shape in the morning as a result.\"",
      "\"For Gene, it was all about the acting,\" added Sonnenfeld. \"End of story. Get me out of here as fast as possible.\"",
      "Showdown with John Travolta",
      "Hackman could be \"a hard actor\" to work with, said Sonnenfeld. \"He suffered no fools.\"",
      "In Get Shorty, Hackman starred alongside Travolta, who plays a Miami mobster sent to collect a debt.",
      "\"Gene was a consummate actor, both technically and artistically. So he came to set every day knowing his lines,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"John came to set not knowing his lines, probably not having read the script the night before.\"",

      "Obituary: One of Hollywood's greatest 'tough guys'",
      "Pilates, painting and bike rides: Gene Hackman's life in Santa Fe",
      "That resulted in a showdown on the first day of filming.",
      "Sonnenfeld recalls Travolta \u2013 who he describes as \"charming but not self aware\" \u2013 asking Hackman what he had done on the weekend.",
      "Hackman responded: \"Nothing except learn the lines,\" to which Travolta replied, \"Well that's a waste of a weekend,\" according to Sonnenfeld.",
      "As filming went on, Hackman grew \"angrier and angrier\" at his co-star not knowing his lines.",
      "Sonnenfeld said he let Hackman take out his rage on him.",
      "\"For the next 12 weeks, he would yell at me whenever John didn't know his lines,\" he said.",
      "\"But he's great in a movie. And I knew he was never really mad at me.\"",
      "Travolta reportedly wasn't the only one to rub Hackman the wrong way.",
      "He reportedly clashed with others, including The Royal Tenenbaums' director Wes Anderson.",
      "Later, and possibly coincidentally, Hackman named one of his novels Escape from Andersonville.",
      "\"Gene was really rough on Wes,\" recalled Bill Murray, who co-starred with Hackman in the hit 2001 film, in an interview with the Associated Press.",
      "\"He was a tough nut, Gene Hackman. But he was really good.\"",
      "Moore, for his part, said he didn't ever feel Hackman was difficult to work with.",
      "\"He was patient and relentlessly, flawlessly professional,\" he said.",
      "\"My memories are of him laughing and smiling, and telling very funny jokes.\"",
      "Moore admitted Hackman might have become irritated with anyone on set who made their role bigger than it was.",
      "\"So I could see how he might be funny about actors who were peacocking themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"But again it goes back to the point - he just really wanted to make the films exceptional.\"",
      "Hackman retired from acting in 2004 and from then on lived a quiet life in New Mexico with his wife.",
      "\"I suspect that one of the reasons he moved to Santa Fe, again, great outdoors and as far away from Hollywood as you can get,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "In 2008, Hackman gave a rare interview with Reuters, in which he was asked if he missed acting.",
      "He responded by saying the business was, for him, \"very stressful\".",
      "\"The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore.\"",
      "But, he added: \"I miss the actual acting part of it, as it's what I did for almost 60 years.",
      "\"And I really loved that.\"",

    "summary": "The strippers, dancers and actresses of Anora give us their take on the film's realism - and its limits.",
    "story": [
      "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.",
      "But he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.",
      "Miranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.",
      "\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"",
      "She told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.",
      "That film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.",
      "Anora star: Oscar talk is 'overwhelming and amazing'",
      "Anora star: Oscar talk is 'overwhelming and amazing'",
      "It's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.",
      "Madison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.",
      "When she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.",
      "\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.",
      "They \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.",
      "We've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.",
      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",

      "However, the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside.",

    "summary": "Fallout from the film about Gaza's children is a reputationally damaging mess, says the BBC's media editor Katie Razzall.",
    "story": [
      "As guests sat down on the red cinema-style seats in the screening room of a plush central London hotel, nobody could have imagined that, less than a month later,  the BBC would find itself forced to apologise for serious and unacceptable flaws in the documentary that was about to be shown.",
      "In the darkness, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone unfolded over an hour, telling in bleak and upsetting detail the story of Gaza's children over recent months of the war.",
      "Screenings are standard practice for media companies, primarily for outside press to review a programme ahead of broadcast.",
      "Also in the room was BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and other senior executives from the BBC's news and current affairs to view what one described as a \"landmark\" piece of filmmaking.",
      "But after the programme went out on BBC Two, it emerged that the child narrator at the heart of the film, 13-year old Abdullah, was the son of a Hamas government official. The outcry and accusations of anti-Israel bias and lack of transparency led the BBC to pull the film from iPlayer.",
      "Questions were asked in Parliament.",
      "'Fell short of expectations'",
      "Criticism continued about the programme's subtitling choices \u2013 including contributors using the Arabic word for \"Jews\" on camera, which was translated in the subtitles as \"Israelis\" or \"Israeli army\". Some argue that the BBC covered up antisemitism. Others have claimed the subtitles are closer to what the speaker intends rather than a literal translation.",
      "After an initial investigation, the BBC said the programme, which had been commissioned by the BBC and made by an outside production company, \"fell short of our expectations\".",
      "It launched a further review headed by the director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston. He will look at whether editorial guidelines were broken and whether anyone should be disciplined.",
      "It's a reputationally damaging mess, but how could it have happened? How did the commissioners of the programme not know that the child narrator's father was a deputy minister for agriculture in the Hamas-run government?",
      "The BBC says it had asked the production company \"a number of times\" in writing during the making of the film about any connections he and his family might have with Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation by the US, UK and others.",
      "In a statement on Thursday the BBC said Hoyo Films, the maker of the film, acknowledged it \"never told the BBC this fact\".",
      "But what did it tell the BBC about the child?",
      "Crucially, the BBC failed to uncover the information itself.",
      "Embarking on a documentary about one of the most polarising and contested issues of our age was always going to be challenging.",
      "The talented director at Hoyo, Jamie Roberts, has won an Emmy award for his film about the evacuation of Kabul. He's award-nominated for a powerful documentary about the events of 6 January in the US. He also made a searing film for the BBC about the Ukraine war.",
      "But he hadn't directed a documentary set in the Middle East before. He was working with the Palestinian journalist, Yousef Hammash, whose Gaza reporting for Channel 4 has won him a Bafta and an Emmy last year.",
      "The BBC commissioners in current affairs will have known the programme wasn't without risk.",
      "In circumstances like this, it's even more difficult to understand how the failings that have driven headlines for days - and done terrible damage to the BBC's reputation - could have occurred.",
      "Programme-makers and commissioners have previously told me they draw up risk grids to ensure they have the answers to any criticism thrown at them about their documentaries. They check and check and check to ensure they won't face problems after their programmes go out - or if they do, that they have the counter-argument ready.",
      "Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4's head of news and current affairs until 2020, told BBC Radio 4's Media Show she would have done her own checks rather than relying on the independent company.",
      "\"If I was making this film, I wouldn't just ask who the boy was, who his father was, who his mother was, I would ask for the entire family tree. They could easily have found out about him, it shows that due diligence was not done.",
      "\"I didn't wait for people to inform me of things,\" she added. \"I asked them the right questions.\"",
      "Byrne says in her view the film isn't \"pro-Hamas\".",
      "Watching it, I was struck by the efforts at balance. It contains voices who curse the leaders of Gaza.",
      "BBC impartiality",
      "One of the children followed by the documentary, 11-year old Zakaria, says he doesn't like Hamas \"because they started the war, they caused all this misery, this is wrong\". A woman says \"they are causing us harm\". There's a conversation about why taking Israeli civilians hostage is wrong.",
      "But we also see the horrors and violence of what's taken place in Gaza -  through the eyes of children. Zakaria, who hangs around the hospital to help the paramedics rather than remaining with his family because, he says, there's no food and water where they are, tells the camera he thinks he's seen 5,000 dead bodies.",
      "Renat who's 10 and is building up a social media presence with an online cookery show, describes drones that shoot bullets. She smiles and laughs wildly on camera, as she describes, still clearly traumatised, how a bomb just exploded right next to her as she was walking outside her apartment.",
      "As the press release put it, the documentary is an \"unflinching and vivid view of life in a warzone\". It's the kind of programme Turness said, as the BBC apologised, that her department \"should be doing\".",
      "But she added \"Of course we have to get it right.\"",
      "The BBC brand is based on impartiality - on being trusted around the world. All of us in news and current affairs take fact-checking very seriously. Mistakes are sometimes made, of course. But on this occasion both the independent production company and the BBC made serious errors which threaten trust in the corporation.",
      "Since joining the BBC as head of news in 2022, Turness has prioritised transparency to grow trust. Not informing viewers about the child narrator's family story is the opposite of transparent.",
      "She will have trusted the experienced BBC commissioners who oversaw the programme to do the appropriate due diligence. They will have trusted the filmmakers and the executive working with them.",
      "This isn't the end of the story and questions still remain. What exactly did the BBC ask about the boy and his family's potential connections to Hamas? Hoyo Films has said it's \"co-operating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston to help understand where mistakes have been made\".",
      "There's also the question about exactly how much was the \"limited sum\" paid for the young narrator's work - and whether that money ended up in the hands of Hamas. Yesterday in Parliament, Lisa Nandy said she had sought assurances from the BBC that it hadn't.",
      "The scandal comes in a week in which the BBC already was apologising over its failure to tackle behaviour by the DJ Tim Westwood - after a separate review that cost more than \u00a33m.",
      "Formal complaint",
      "What's happened has damaged trust in the BBC in so many ways. Those who argue the corporation is biased against Israel will feel vindicated.",
      "Leo Pearlman, co-CEO of the major British production company Fulwell 73, told us on Radio 4 that the BBC has \"gaslit the Jewish community\" in the 16 months since October 7th and that this documentary parroted 'the propaganda of Hamas\".",
      "For others who view the BBC as having anti-Palestinian bias, the decision to pull the documentary and apologise will confirm their beliefs. Artists For Palestine, which includes Gary Lineker, Anita Rani, Riz Ahmed and Miriam Margolyes, says the claims about the identity of the child's father are \"misleading\" and that to conflate his \"civil service role\" with terrorism is \"factually incorrect\".",
      "The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians has lodged a formal complaint against the BBC for taking down the documentary and \"suppressing the testimony of Palestinians\". It says the deputy minister for agriculture's role involves \"food production relating to crops, fishing and livestock\".",
      "What's unfolded since the programme's broadcast is unlikely to change minds on any side.",
      "The losers in all this are the young citizens of Gaza. The stories of the children in this film - and the suffering they have endured - aren't now being seen.",
      "Hoyo Films said it believes \"this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors \u2013 who have no say in the war \u2013 should have their voices heard\".",
      "The BBC has made clear it has no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer.",

    "story": [
      "GB News has won its judicial review of decisions made by TV watchdog Ofcom, that two shows hosted by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg breached the broadcasting code.",
      "The High Court judgment by Mrs Justice Collins Rice concluded that Ofcom's rulings were unlawful. It is the first time the watchdog has lost such a case.",
      "The judgement said Ofcom's initial rulings -  that the 9 May and 13 June 2023 broadcasts were in breach of its codes on \"due impartiality and due accuracy in news\" - were unlawful.",
      "GB News CEO Angelos Frangopoulos said the decision \"vindicates GB News' position as the fearless defender of free speech in the United Kingdom\", while Ofcom said it \"accepted the court's guidance\".",
      "'Fundamental failure'",
      "Mr Frangopoulos added: \"I call on the government and Parliament to consider the seriousness of this fundamental failure by Ofcom.\"",
      "The judge's ruling stated: \"I am minded to quash the two decisions in this case, and remit them to be reconsidered by Ofcom, subject to whatever further procedure may be fairly indicated.\"",
      "The court found that Ofcom had misapplied Rule 5.3 of the code, saying the provision only applies to \"news programmes\" and not to current affairs shows, such as the one Sir Jacob hosts.",
      "The decisions had been made as part of five GB News rulings by Ofcom in March last year, including three about shows hosted by Esther McVey and Philip Davies.",
      "Ofcom's rulings had said the State of the Nation shows hosted by Sir Jacob broke rules stating politicians should not usually front news coverage.",
      "The Ofcom code says a politician can't be a newsreader, interviewer or reporter in a news programme \"unless, exceptionally, it is editorially justified\". They can, however, front current affairs shows.",
      "At the time, Sir Jacob was the Conservative MP for North East Somerset.",
      "Ofcom paying legal costs",
      "During the programmes, the \"host politicians acted as newsreaders, news interviewers or news reporters in sequences which clearly constituted news - including reporting breaking news events - without exceptional justification\", according to Ofcom investigations last year.",
      "The regulator concluded at the time: \"News was, therefore, not presented with due impartiality.\"",
      "But GB News responded to the rulings, saying: \"These decisions go against established precedent and raises serious questions about Ofcom's oversight over its own regulations.\"",
      "Ofcom said on Friday:  \"We accept the court's guidance on this important aspect of due impartiality in broadcast news and the clarity set out in its judgment.",
      "\"We will now review and consult on proposed changes to the broadcasting code to restrict politicians from presenting news in any type of programme to ensure this is clear for all broadcasters.\"",

    "summary": "Some fans aren't happy with the characters' updated appearance, 15 years on from the last Shrek film.",
    "story": [
      "The long-awaited first trailer for the new Shrek 5 film has been criticised by some film fans over the way characters have been animated, giving them different facial features.",
      "In the 27-second clip, recurring characters Shrek, Donkey, Pinocchio and Princess Fiona appear alongside Felicia - one of Shrek and Fiona's now grown-up children.",
      "The short teaser announces that Zendaya is joining the cast as Felicia, whilst also reintroducing Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy who are all reprising their roles.",
      "Oli Hyatt, who runs Blue Zoo Animation, told the BBC there's often \"an instant reaction\" when changes are made to a film like Shrek, due to its \"nostalgic properties\".",
      "Some users on social media have described the changes as \"disrespectful to the original art style\" and \"an AI interpretation of what Shrek 5 could look like\".",
      "Others have compared it to the film animation of video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, which Paramount Pictures changed after fan backlash in 2019.",
      "Hyatt added: \"The generation of children that watched Shrek back [when it was first released in 2001] are now adults.",
      "\"There's usually a feeling of 'this isn't what I knew' or 'I want the old show I remember back'\", he says.",
      "Hyatt, whose team contributed to The Adventures of Paddington and Lego City - No Limits, said that \"because the trailer is so short it's hard to tell how its going to look in general\".",
      "But, he added: \"You can see from a technical perspective, the advancement in technology.",
      "\"That means that on a similar or lower budget, you can producer a higher sheen and render quality, so it doesn't look quite as CGI (computer-generated imagery) and feels more tangible and real\".",
      "He doesn't feel like much has changed from the original \"art style\" of Shrek, but says \"the colours, vibrancy and realism\" have changed, which is a symptom of animation technology improving.",
      "In the short trailer, Shrek (Mike Myers), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Felicia (Zendaya) gather round a magic mirror to ask \"Who's the fairest of them all?\".",
      "The face in the mirror, which also appears to have had a bit of a makeover, responds that it is Shrek, with images then flashed up on screen of Shrek wearing glasses and posing, then dancing in a skintight catsuit before appearing with rippling abdominal muscles.",
      "This pays tribute to some of the internet's favourite Shrek memes, whilst giving viewers a first look at the now grown-up Felicia, who first came to life in Shrek The Third in 2007, alongside her triplet siblings Fergus and Farkle.",
      "Shrek's return was teased at the end of the Puss In Boots sequel in 2022, so fans have been expecting this new film for quite some time.",
      "Its perhaps why the much-loved film has sparked so much pushback, with fans joking that Shrek looks like he's has had \"botox and a face lift\" whilst others have criticised the characters for having rounder faces.",
      "But not everyone has a problem with the new looks - some have praised the animators for ageing the characters with greying hair and wrinkles, whilst others say the updated animations are just a symptom of CGI improving.",
      "'Forgotten in two minutes'",
      "Hyatt said that despite the criticism that's been levelled at the trailer, he believes it will be \"forgotten within two minutes of watching the movie\".",
      "\"Shrek has never been about looking cute or beautiful, it's about being gross with all the jokes and silliness,\" he says.",
      "\"If they [the producers] have got the script right and the characters right, then people will still love it, it's still a great franchise.\"",
      "Shrek 5 is slated for release in December 2026, following on from Shrek Forever After in 2010."

      "\"I'd be very happy to watch it as a punter, because then I could enjoy it,\" he said, speaking at the annual Oscar Wilde event to celebrate Irish talent.",
      "He also admitted that he can see why some people want to revisit the series.",
      "\"Of course, part of me is curious, I'd love to see those characters in 15 years,\" he said.",
      "\"I just adore Sally [Rooney]'s writing so much, I'm excited every time she releases a new book, so I'm just looking forward to reading what she does next.\"",
      "Hardwicke said he still speaks to his Normal People co-stars.",
      "\"We all stay in touch, which is nice. It was a really special thing for all of us,\" he said.",

      "Hardwicke said he didn't have an answer for why people are so fascinated by true crime, but said as an actor, \"you just want to work on stuff that has that depth\".",
      "\"There's a responsibility to telling true stories, to know why you're doing it, why you're telling the story, what's the point,\" he said.",

      "Mr Jones admitted he did not often book half-days off work to go to museums and exhibitions but it was because he \"was interested to go and see it\".",
      "Members of the public booked slots to use the toilet in its cubicle as part of the exhibition.",

      "Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice, after authorities found insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.",
      "But there is one country where the documentary has still not been aired: Japan - where it has run into huge controversy.",
      "Shiori's former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage that she did not have permission to use, which, they maintain, has violated trust and put her sources at risk.",
      "She defends what she did as necessary for \"public good\".",
      "It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke. Then 28 years old, Shiori had chosen to ignore her family's request to remain silent about the alleged rape. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Yamaguchi - and won $30,000 (\u00a322,917) in damages.",
      "Shiori told the BBC making the film involved \"re-living her trauma\".",
      "\"It took me four years [to make the film] because, emotionally, I was struggling.\"",

      "CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel forms part of the more than 400 hours of footage which she has edited for the documentary.",
      "Shiori, who directed and wrote Black Box Diaries, describes the editing process as \"really challenging\".",
      "\"It was like hardcore exposure therapy,\" she says.",
      "But when the film was released, the CCTV footage included in the documentary became a source of friction between the director and the team of lawyers who had helped her win her civil case.",
      "The lawyers stated her use of CCTV footage was unauthorised - and that Shiori had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .",
      "Last week, her former lawyers - led by Yoko Nishihiro - held a press conference, in which she said Shiori's use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.",
      "\"If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,\" Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "Ms Nishihiro claimed Shiori also used unauthorised recordings in the film, which the lawyer only discovered following the screening of the film last July.",
      "The documentary included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower in relation to the investigation process, as well as video of a taxi driver who had provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape.",
      "Both the detective and the taxi driver, the lawyers have argued, were identifiable in the film - and neither had given their consent to be featured.",
      "\"I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,\"  Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "\"I want her to explain and be held accountable.\"",
      "Shiori has previously acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV footage, but has argued that it provided \"the only visual evidence\" of the night she claims she was sexually assaulted.",
      "She said including audio of the police detective was necessary because of \"the cover-up of the investigation\", and has insisted she was releasing the video \"for the public good\".",
      "\"We are standing in different points of view,\" she said, referring to her fall-out with her former lawyers.",
      "\"For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.\"",
      "There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. According to Shiori, \"Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]\".",
      "However, it remains unclear how far the lack of distribution might also be due to legal hurdles.",
      "In her most recent statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals could not be identified. She said a redacted version would be screened at a later stage.",
      "\"There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of - but I wanted to put all of it, and to show we are also human,\" she told the BBC.",

      "Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from \"forcible sexual intercourse\" to \"non-consensual sexual intercourse\" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.",
      "Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: \"Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.\"",

      "\"You are still driven with fear as much as you are driven with love, and you're still worried that people aren't receptive to where you're from and when you're talking about greatness and moving the city forward and the country forward as a whole.",
      "\"Maybe some people won't understand Kneecap and Young Spencer on the same stage until 20, 30 years' time, but that's ok because what's supposed to be understood will be understood.\"",
      "From the Shankill to the SSE",
      "Young Spencer is the alter-ego of Gareth Spence, who during the day works in a school in Belfast.",
      "He was raised on the Shankill Road, which he admits saw guns, drugs, paramilitaries and division during many troubled years in Northern Ireland.",
      "But living there has been in his own words \"a gift\" as well as a curse.",
      "Now 30 years old, he got into rapping as a teenager after getting therapy, and said personal traumas have influenced his music.",
      "\"We're all reporters... we have a responsibility to speak on these issues and be a voice for the voiceless and we will always be a voice for the city.",
      "\"Real change happens and I feel like that's what the show represented more than anything.\"",
      "Gareth said we can't be shy of acknowledging that there is always likely to be division.",
      "Yet he believes more is shared across Belfast's working-class areas.",
      "\"A lot of people have this sort of warped opinion of the communities that we're from too, whether it be the Shankill or the Falls, anywhere in Belfast because they go back to this troublesome period from 30 years ago and they still stay stuck in that.",
      "\"But you'll find unification in so many ways and so many different forms now in the city than you ever have.\"",
      "United more than divided",
      "The rapper said we're \"a lot closer to peace now than we've ever been\".",
      "\"There will always be division of some extent, we will never get away from that completely because that's life and not everybody likes each other and that's just plain and simple,\" he told Good Morning Ulster.",
      "\"But everybody has the right to be identified as who they identify as.",
      "\"My thing is that being a proud Protestant, being from Belfast, being from the Shankill, doesn't take away from them being proud Catholics and being from west Belfast and being from the Falls Road, why can't we unite?\"",
      "Across Young Spencer's social media platforms is the acronym P.R.O.D - but it is used more so as a set of principles to live by rather than a label.",
      "\"Passion, persistence, respect, resilience, opportunity to overcome, dedication, determination,\" he explained.",
      "\"You can look into the colours and identify my background, pick here and there and do whatever you want, but that's the core set of values and principles that got me to where I am here today and help me keep living my dream.\"",
      "So what's next for the Shankill's son?",
      "\"Inspire to inspire, motivate to motivate. Persisting with my passion when they chose to hate,\" he said.",
      "\"Respect is earned, resilience is where I was raised, opportunity comes, overcome and make your name. Determined and dedicated to making a change and that's P.R.O.D.\"",

    "summary": "When was the last time two musicals were up for best picture? And could Adrien Brody break a record?",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not.",
      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "- - - - -",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for acting, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",
      "\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\".",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), the nominees from all categories were invited to mingle over dinner and cocktails, as an eventful awards race reaches its conclusion.",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "12. Clarence Maclin knows what time it is",
      "Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.",
      "But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.",
      "Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.",
      "In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.",

      "The best picture race has been wide open this year, with The Brutalist and Emilia P\u00e9rez winning at the Golden Globes, Conclave at the Baftas and now SAG Awards, and Anora at a string of industry guilds including those voted by producers, writers and directors.",

    "summary": "The Monster Hunter series exploded in popularity globally after years of success in Japan. How did they do it?",
    "story": [
      "The latest release in one of Japan's most popular video game series has had one of the most successful debuts of all time.",
      "More than one million players have logged on to the PC version of Monster Hunter Wilds within hours of its launch, according to figures from online store Steam.",
      "There have been complaints from the first wave of players on Steam about the game's performance on computers, but its critical response has been positive.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to director Yuya Tokuda and producer Ryozo Tsujimoto prior to the release of Wilds about turning the game into a global hit.",
      "Monster Hunter first launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004.",
      "As the title suggests, players spend the game navigating an area known as The Forbidden Lands capturing and battling a cast of increasingly fearsome beasts.",
      "Long-time fans of the series are drawn in by its challenging, complex systems and option to play co-operatively, teaming up with friends to take down massive foes.",
      "Breakout 2018 hit Monster Hunter World has has sold 21.3 million copies, according to publisher Capcom, rising to 28.1 million when sales of an upgraded 2019 edition are included.",
      "Producer Mr Tsujimoto told BBC Newsbeat the game was a culmination of all the work and lessons learned from previous titles on the series.",
      "\"Anything that we hadn't been doing we really tried to do with Monster Hunter World to get everything ready so that the game was ready to break through,\" he said.",
      "Games industry layoffs and studio closures in the West and Europe have led to fears of \"brain drain\" - a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.",
      "Japan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.",
      "Monster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.",
      "\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.",
      "\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"",
      "Other Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.",
      "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020.",
      "The company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time.",
      "This can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.",
      "'We're working in our own lanes'",
      "The Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way.",
      "More recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.",
      "At last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.",

      "The deal gives an extra \u00a3889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients.",
      "The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments.",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices.",

      "GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under.",
      "Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments.",
      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",
      "More money to cover rising costs",
      "The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.",

      "\"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.",

      "The 58-year-old, who was diagnosed with the condition in 2023 after being admitted to hospital, told BBC Breakfast how he once \"hallucinated a gun on the table\".",
      "\"This wasn't all the time, but it was getting greater and greater, and being sectioned was the best thing that could happen to me,\" he said.",
      "Blumenthal, who runs several award-winning restaurants, including the three Michelin starred The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, has now become an official ambassador for Bipolar UK.",
      "According to the charity, the mental health condition is an episodic disorder characterised by sometimes extreme changes in mood and energy which has the highest risk of suicide of any mental health condition.",
      "\"I laughed out loud after receiving a message from a woman who told me that during a manic episode she thought the TV was talking to her,\" Blumenthal, who also has ADHD, said.",
      "\"The reason I laughed out loud was because I experienced the same thing.\"",
      "The chef said it was \"really difficult\" for his wife, French businesswoman Melanie Ceysson, who he married in 2023.",
      "\"She had to decide how I would take it [being sectioned] and ... my response was, I embraced it, but I never thought I was going to be diagnosed as being bipolar, I thought at the time, the highs and the lows were normal, but they weren't.",
      "\"And they weren't right for me, and they weren't right for the people around me that ... cared for me.\"",
      "The NHS says a person can be detained, also known as sectioning, under the Mental Health Act and can be treated without their agreement if they \"need urgent treatment for a mental health disorder and are at risk of harm to themselves or others\".",
      "Famous for his experimental dishes such as snail porridge and bacon and egg ice cream, Blumenthal said medication initially dulled his culinary imagination.",
      "\"I was zombified - I had no energy at all.",
      "\"As my medications have been changed and my levels of self-confidence and self-awareness have gone up I realise my imagination and creativity is still there,\" he said.",

      "\"It lays the basis for further work to implement a service on the Island for those facing a terminal illness who would like more autonomy and dignity at the time of their death.\"",

      "Both bills spell out the need for patients to have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure.",
      "The Isle of Man bill says people would be expected to have fewer than 12 months to live, but the Leadbeater bill has adopted a more conservative six months.",
      "The Manx suggestion of needing five years of residency on the island to be eligible is to try to stop people going there to take advantage of the scheme, as people do by travelling to Switzerland's Dignitas clinic.",
      "Assisted Dying Bill passed by Legislative Council",
      "Manx doctors reject assisted dying bill in survey",
      "On the Isle of Man, two independent doctors will need to agree the request for assisted dying, but Leadbeater has recently suggested that cases in England and Wales could be approved by a panel of experts rather than a single judge, as was originally proposed.",
      "That change has proved controversial, but is one of about 300 amendments being considered by a cross-party committee of MPs.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation being proposed in Jersey has very similar restrictions to the Westminster plans. However, it has a proposal that would extend the right to die for terminally ill adults with six months or fewer left to live to 12 months for people with neurodegenerative conditions",
      "As with the Westminster legislation, the Isle of Man has experienced some passionate campaigning both for and against the proposed new law.",
      "A third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey in 2023 said they would consider leaving if the legislation was introduced.",
      "Some doctors fear the legislation will be a \"slippery slope\" that will see the scope of the laws extended.",

      "Listen to this article",
      "Listen to this article",
      "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",
      "\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"",
      "He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",
      "\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.",
      "In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.",
      "And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.",
      "An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.",
      "The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.",
      "And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",
      "Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.",

      "Hooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choice",
      "Ketamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'",
      "But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.",
      "'It's in the schools, it's in the parks'",
      "One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",
      "The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.",
      "Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"",
      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

      "She called for a discussion on \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\" \u2013 in other words, a debate on tax and borrowing.",
      "Labour MPs have been remarkably disciplined in not publicly opposing policies which privately make them queasy, but there are fears of over forthcoming welfare cuts and there has been discontent over the winter fuel allowance, the two child benefit cap, and lack of compensation for Waspi women.",
      "So will Anneliese Dodds's resignation loosen the tongues of other discontented MPs?",
      "While it was widely expected that Keir Starmer would move robustly away from the politics and poses of the Corbyn years, some of the current contingent of MPs are concerned that he is moving away from commitments made by his predecessors  Tony Blair and Gordon Brown too.",
      "It was Blair who announced the move to the aid target of 0.7% of GDP \u2013 a commitment subsequently delivered by David Cameron despite an era of austerity.",
      "It was Brown who introduced a universal winter fuel payment for pensioners.",
      "For those Labour MPs who have the phrase \"I didn't come into politics to do this\" nagging sotto voce at their conscience, then Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's strong praise for their leader's aid cuts won't have made life any easier.",
      "But the prime minister has inherited a less benign economy than the last Labour government  \u2013 and arguably a more malign world, with 'peace dividends' firmly thrown into  the dustbin of history.",
      "In Keir Starmer's letter responding to Anneliese Dodds's resignation, the PM states that he made \"a difficult and painful decision\" and not one he took lightly.",
      "But it worth noting that it is a decision which is far from universally unpopular in Labour's ranks.",
      "Polling suggests that there is strong support amongst the wider electorate both for a rise in defence spending AND a cut in overseas aid.",
      "Many of the MPs in the so-called Red Wall - those seats lost to the Conservatives in the Midlands and Northern England in 2019 and regained in 2024 \u2013 have seen an increasing challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK.",
      "They want to see a greater emphasis on patriotism and a tougher line on immigration.",
      "So apparently putting Britain first \u2013 more spent on defence here, less spending overseas \u2013 will be seen by some as a way of inoculating themselves against the growing threat of Reform.",
      "But with more tough decisions ahead, the remarkable coalition assembled by Labour at the last general election will come under increasing pressure.",
      "Anneliese Dodds was the first to walk away from the top table over policy.",
      "Keir Starmer knows it's possible she won't be the last."

      "\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"",
      "In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\".",
      "Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.",

      "Sir Keir said the president's last state visit in 2019 had been a \"tremendous success\" and that the invite for a second visit was \"truly historic\" and \"unprecedented\".",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after reading the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "Live updates: Trump says he's hopeful for Ukraine peace deal and UK trade deal after Starmer talks",
      "Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?",
      "Traditionally second-term US presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.",
      "King Charles' letter proposed a meeting to discuss details of the state visit at either Dumfries House or Balmoral, both in Scotland, a country to which Trump has connections.",
      "His mother was born and brought up on the Hebridean island of Lewis. This year he is planning to open a new golf course in Aberdeenshire, to be named after his mother.",
      "The letter, which Trump showed to the cameras, read: \"Quite apart from this presenting an opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest, it would also offer a valuable chance to plan a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "\"As you will know this is unprecedented by a US president. That is why I would find it helpful for us to be able to discuss, together, a range of options for location and programme content.",
      "\"In so doing, working together, I know we will further enhance the special relationship between our two countries of which we are both so proud.\"",
      "Trump joked that he would have to check if the signature was real.",
      "At a joint news conference later, Trump said a trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\" and could see the UK avoiding the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on other countries.",
      "Sir Keir said the two countries would begin work on a new economic deal which would be centred on the potential of artificial intelligence.",
      "During his visit Sir Keir also hopes to influence Trump as he seeks to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Speaking on the plane to the US, Sir Keir told reporters that a deal would not stop Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine again, unless the US were able to provide security guarantees.",
      "Asked if the US could offer such support, Trump said a proposed deal with Ukraine over access to critical minerals would provide \"a backstop\".",
      "\"We are a backstop because we will be over there, we will be working in the country,\" he said.",
      "Since becoming prime minister, Sir Keir, who had previously been critical of the president, has sought to build a close relationship with Trump.",
      "However, he did feel compelled to contradict the US president when he accused Volodymyr Zelensky of being a dictator.",
      "Asked about his dictator comments, Trump said: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.\"",
      "Pressed over whether he would approve the UK's potential deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, Trump said: \"We're going to have some discussions about that very soon, and I have a feeling it's going to work out very well.",
      "\"I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country,\"",
      "In an interview after arriving in the US on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the controversial deal would not go ahead unless the US supported it.",
      "Under the proposal, the UK would cede sovereignty of the Chagos archipelago to Mauritius but would still be able to use one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which includes a UK-US military airbase."

    "story": [
      "MP Mike Amesbury, who admitted repeatedly punching a constituent in the street, has had his 10-week prison sentence suspended following an appeal.",
      "The Runcorn and Helsby MP assaulted Paul Fellows, 45, following a row in Frodsham, Cheshire, last year and was jailed by magistrates on Monday.",
      "Amesbury, who had the Labour whip removed in October, launched an appeal and a judge said that while the length of the sentence had been \"spot on\", it should be suspended for two years.",
      "Judge Steven Everett, sitting with two magistrates at Chester Crown Court, also ordered Amesbury to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.",
      "Amesbury must also undertake an alcohol monitoring programme, go on an anger management course, and carry out 20 days of rehabilitation work.",
      "His sentence still leaves the 55-year-old MP, who now sits as an independent, at risk of being ousted.",
      "If at least 10% of his constituents back a recall petition, a by-election will take place.",
      "Leaving court, Amesbury refused to answer questions from the waiting media about whether he would resign as an MP.",
      "But he said: \"I'd like to reiterate that I sincerely apologise once again to Mr Fellows and his family.",

      "It showed Amesbury punching Mr Fellows in the head, knocking him to the ground.",
      "The politician then hit him at least five more times and swore at him.",
      "Amesbury was then heard saying: \"You won't threaten your MP again, will you?\"",
      "Judge Everett told Amesbury the facts showed him \"in a truly unfavourable light\" and, as an MP, he \"should be showing an example\".",
      "While acknowledging it would be wrong to sentence him differently because he was an MP, the judge added: \"That doesn't mean we can't take into account that your behaviour as an MP was simply disgraceful.\"",
      "He said he also could not ignore Amesbury's \"heavy drinking and fighting\".",
      "'Pack of lies'",
      "The former Labour politician had arrived at court in a prison van and wore handcuffs as he was led into the building.",
      "The court heard that, in a prepared statement given in a police interview, Amesbury claimed he had been approached by a man \"shouting and screaming\" about local and national matters.",
      "The MP said that, because he was terrified and the other man's \"arms were swinging\", he felt he had no option but to \"defend\" himself.",
      "But the judge told him the CCTV pictures revealed a very different story.",
      "\"In reality, you told the police a pack of lies. Nothing more, nothing less,\" he said.",
      "Judge Everett questioned why a charge of affray - which can carry a longer sentence - had not been brought by the prosecution.",
      "Daniel Travers, defending Amesbury, told the court: \"He's now had three nights in prison which is an experience he will never forget, certainly.\"",
      "He said the \"public shaming\" and \"embarrassment\" had had a huge impact on his client.",
      "\"This is a man who will certainly rehabilitate,\" said Mr Travers. \"He will learn a very painful lesson.\"",
      "'Parliamentary rules'",
      "The confirmation of Amesbury's prison sentence, even though it has now been suspended, could still result in him being ousted from the Commons.",
      "The long-time Labour politician has been sitting as an independent MP for the last four months, following his suspension by party bosses.",
      "Under parliamentary rules, if an MP receives a custodial sentence a \"recall petition\" is triggered.",
      "After hearing from Chester Crown Court, the Speaker of the House of Commons will contact the returning officer for Amesbury's Runcorn and Helsby constituency.",
      "Constituents will then have six weeks to ask for their MP's removal by registering at 10 nominated places.",
      "If at least 10% of them vote to remove Amesbury, a by-election will be called.",
      "It would be the first by-election since Labour came to power following the July 2024 general election.",
      "Having first been elected as a Labour MP in the Cheshire constituency of Weaver Vale in 2017, Amesbury comfortably won the Runcorn and Helsby seat which was created following boundary changes.",

      "The Home Office said the previous recorded peak was in 2002.",
      "The new high follows an uptick in recorded small boat arrivals in recent years. The number of small boat arrivals also increased in 2024 - 25% higher than in 2023 - but the figure was 20% lower than in 2022.",
      "The UK now receives the fifth largest number of asylum seekers in the \"EU plus\" area at a time when the government is under pressure to cut the asylum decision backlog.",
      "These figures, which cover the end of the Conservative government and the start of Labour, show the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision fell by 5% last year - with more than 90,600 cases, relating to around 124,800 people, pending a decision as of the end of 2024.",
      "The number remains higher than before 2022.",
      "The UK also sent more people into immigration detention last year, with that figure increasing by 12%.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK returned 2,251 people to another country who had arrived by small boat last year, a 10% increase compared to 2023.",
      "There has also been a sharp increase in people granted citizenship - with the figure standing at more than 269,600 in 2024.",
      "The prime minister's deputy official spokesman said there were \"no quick fixes\" to the \"global\" problem of illegal migration, but the government had a \"serious long-term plan to restore order to the asylum system\".",
      "Border Security and Asylum minister Angela Eagle criticised the previous government for a \"broken asylum system\", saying Labour inherited a \"huge backlog\" of claims.",
      "\"We are beginning to get some order to the system but it will take time to make certain that we can get a grip and start making the system work again.\"",
      "Asked why claims are so high, Eagle said \"many people want to come here\", further referring to those coming on work and student visas and then claiming asylum.",

      "Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as \"no surprise,\" saying there was \"no deterrent\".",

      "\"For the vast majority of people, there is no way to claim asylum in the UK without already being here.\"",
      "New guidance issued for visa and immigration staff earlier this month set out that  anyone entering the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey to do so, including those already here, will normally be refused citizenship.",
      "The measure was criticised by the Refugee Council as well as some Labour MPs.",
      "The Refugee Council said on Thursday it was \"encouraged\" the government continued to work on the \"broken asylum system\" during its first six months in power.",
      "However, it called for further efforts to cut the backlog of asylum applications to avoid people \"stuck in hotels, trapped in limbo and unable to work\".",
      "The government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers has continued to rise, with more than 38,000 in hotels at the end of December. That figure was still lower than the peak of 56,000 hit in September 2023.",
      "The government has pledged to stop this practice by the end of the parliament.",
      "The government is legally obliged to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who cannot afford to support themselves while their claims are being considered. But the number of people seeking asylum in the UK has hit record levels, leading to a shortage of spaces in existing accommodation.",
      "While irregular arrivals rose last year, the number of work and study visas - which account for a majority of arrivals, not including visitors and transit, examined by the Home Office - dropped.",
      "The previous Conservative government introduced measures to reduce legal migration with changes to visa processes \u2013 including an increase to the minimum salary for a UK skilled worker visa.",
      "The Conservatives also banned health and social care workers and most international students from bringing family to the UK.",
      "The number of people coming to the UK on work visas last year fell by about 250,000.",
      "This was almost evenly split between fewer people coming for work (down by more than 125,000) and fewer family members coming with them (down by nearly 120,000).",
      "Both falls were largely driven by trends in the health and care worker route.",
      "The previous government introduced a special visa to bring people into the sector. This led to huge rises in visas issued - especially since people coming to work in care tend to bring more family with them than people coming on other work visas.",
      "But Rishi Sunak's government tightened the rules late in 2023, leading to falls in people coming on this visa throughout last year.",
      "In September 2024, the current Labour government announced further measures including stronger rules around visa sponsorship of migrant workers.",

      "Dr Ben Brindle, researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford,  referred to a \"boom and bust\" in some visa categories over recent years.",
      "\"The large declines in visa grants have been possible primarily because the number of visas previously being issued in the post-Brexit immigration system was so high,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Degrading, violent and misogynistic pornography should be banned, a review of the industry has recommended.",
      "The review, commissioned by the previous government and headed by the Conservative peer Baroness Gabby Bertin, urges ministers to give regulator Ofcom sweeping powers to police porn sites deemed to contain \"harmful\" material.",
      "It proposes outlawing \"degrading, violent and misogynistic content\", including making it illegal to possess or publish pornography showing women being choked during sex.",
      "Non-fatal strangulation is already an offence if someone does not consent but its depiction online is not illegal and the review finds it is \"rife on mainstream platforms\".",
      "All porn sites must 'robustly' verify UK user ages by July",
      "The 'incredible' number of UK adults watching porn",
      "The review proposes that porn videos considered too harmful for any certificate in the offline world should be banned online.",
      "Baroness Bertin argues that online pornography contributes to some of the \"gravest issues in our society, from domestic violence to toxic masculinity to the mental health crisis among young people\".",
      "She told the BBC: \"I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch porn. I'm not saying porn shouldn't exist. I'm not a prude.\"",
      "However, her 32 recommendations on what government should do about the \"high-harm sector\" of legal online pornography are likely to initiate a debate about how far the state should police people's sex lives.",
      "Baroness Bertin said online porn was not \"properly scrutinised and regulated\" in the same way as offline content.",
      "\"It strikes me as incredible that to buy a DVD, which sounds so sort of retro, the BBFC [British Board of Film Classification] has to put a stamp on it, has to check that certain standards have been met. That there's no sense you are encouraging child sexual abuse. No harmful, degrading, humiliating practices which is not through consensual roleplay,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"You just have to go on the homepages of some of these mainstream sites and you will see of all that degrading content \u2013 particularly violent towards women \u2013 and it's all there for everyone to see.\"",
      "Her report suggests pornography websites depicting the non-fatal choking of women during sex has normalised such behaviour in the real world, with violent and degrading material rife on mainstream platforms amid a \"total absence of government scrutiny\".",
      "The review cites research suggesting that over a quarter of the nation regularly accesses online porn with a third of all men watching material at least once a week. It concludes that increasingly disturbing content is \"rewiring\" the way young people think about gender, sex and their role in society.",
      "The Department for Science Innovation and Technology said it would look at the links the review highlighted.",
      "\"We have already announced we will ban the creation of intimate deepfakes without consent and from next month under the Online Safety Act platforms will have to proactively tackle illegal content including extreme pornography and sexual abuse material,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"But further action is needed to address the review's shocking finding that graphic strangulation is increasingly appearing in pornography, despite being illegal, and is becoming normalised in real life.",
      "\"We will urgently ensure that platforms, law enforcement and prosecutors take all necessary steps to tackle this disturbing harm.\"",
      "Downing Street also described the findings of a report into the porn industry as \"shocking\", and suggested it would \"act swiftly\" to address gaps in the law - but stopped short of saying it would be banned.",
      "The review's recommendations were welcomed by the End Violence Against Women Coalition, which called for action from the government to address the harms arising from the current state of the porn industry.",
      "\"We know these companies are profiting enormously from sexual violence, and until they are forced to clean up their act, they won't,\" the group's director Andrea Simon said.",
      "Madelaine Thomas, an adult content creator, also welcomed the review but added: \"If we look to police people's sexual interests that's problematic.",
      "\"I don't think prohibition has ever eliminated demand in any way but I do think there are ways that we can work together to come up with frameworks that prioritise both consent and compassion and allow people to create and view what they would like to view on the internet,\" she told BBC Two's Politics Live.",
      "'Confusing world'",
      "Baroness Bertin argues that her proposals for sweeping new controls in currently legal pornography online would prevent real-world violence against women and girls.",
      "The review relates how a 14-year-old boy asked a teacher how to choke girls during sex and suggests online porn has created \"such a confusing world for our sons\".",
      "\"They are, quite rightly, encouraged and taught to reject sexist attitudes, while a subterranean online world of pornography is simultaneously showing them that anything goes,\" Baroness Bertin writes.",
      "Ministers are urged to fund programmes for boys and young men which encourage positive masculinity and counter misogynistic culture.",
      "The report quotes BBC research suggesting up to 38% of British women had experienced being strangled during intercourse, but notes that nearly half of those women wanted to be choked. \"This is important in demonstrating freedom of sexual expression and its nuance,\" the review says.",
      "Nevertheless, the report concludes that society has decided that \"enough is enough\" of harmful online pornography and its impact on young people.",
      "Measures to increase regulation of pornography, including to prevent children accessing explicit content, are already part of the Online Safety Act, which became law in October 2023.",

    "story": [
      "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.",
      "The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.",
      "The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.",
      "If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.",
      "\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.",
      "Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process.",
      "The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.",
      "Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.",
      "On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".",
      "The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.",
      "An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.",
      "Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".",
      "Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.",
      "It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.",
      "But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.",
      "Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. \"The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,\" he added.",
      "Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.",
      "\"People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,\" he added.",
      "Union Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\".",
      "Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be \"a win for everyone\".",
      "She said it would create more flight slots across both runways.",
      "\"That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice.\"",
      "'Bucket and spade' airport",
      "Sally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about \"uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change\".",
      "\"We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,\" she said.",
      "The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.",
      "Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.",
      "On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.",
      "Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released.",
      "But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.",
      "The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.",

    "summary": "The prime minister announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has challenged Sir Keir Starmer over the hike in defence spending, after the PM said the rise amounted to \u00a313.4bn.",
      "The PM announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, following President Trump's demand that all European allies increase their defence contributions.",
      "The decision comes as Sir Keir is set to fly to the US for talks with Trump in the White House, to discuss the war in Ukraine, later.",
      "Badenoch questioned Sir Keir over the exact amount, which Defence Secretary John Healey said could be calculated as \u00a36bn when inflation was taken into account, and whether the Chagos deal would be funded from it.",
      "Chris Mason: PM confronts Europe's new reality",
      "Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?",
      "Can Europe still count on the US coming to its defence?",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch asked whether any of the new funding would be going towards the multi-billion pound Chagos deal twice.",
      "The UK plans to hand over the territory to Mauritius, but under the terms of the deal, the UK will continue to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase, for a period of 99 years.",
      "The PM responded saying the increase in defence spending that was announced on Tuesday was for \"our capability on defence and security in Europe\", adding: \"The Chagos deal is extremely important for our security and for US security.\"",
      "Badenoch focused her questions to the prime minister on which figure for the defence rise - his initial \u00a313.4bn or \u00a36bn, which Healey said was the increase \"in real terms\"  - was correct.",
      "Sir Keir responded: \"If you take the numbers for this financial year and then the numbers for the financial year 2027-28, that's a \u00a313.4bn increase.",
      "\"That's the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War which will put us in a position to ensure the security and defence of our country and of Europe.\"",
      "Badenoch pressed him again, saying: \"The IFS said today that the government is playing silly games with numbers. How does he find this difference in numbers?\"",
      "Repeating himself, the PM then said they had already been \"going through the same question over and over again\" at previous PMQs and said \"if you ask again I'll give the same answer again\", to loud cheers from his backbenchers.",
      "Objecting, Badenoch pointed out that \"being patronising is not the same as answering the question\".",
      "When Badenoch suggested Sir Keir had listened to her advice on using international aid money for defence, he said: \"I'm going to have to let the leader of the opposition down gently... She didn't feature in my thinking at all.",
      "\"I was so busy over the weekend I didn't even see her proposal.",
      "\"She has appointed herself I think saviour of the western civilisation in a desperate search for relevance.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged the prime minister to back the idea of a European rearmament bank \"so that we can finance a big increase in manufacturing capacity without the need to cut Britain's vital soft power\".",
      "The prime minister replied that there was \"an ongoing discussion\" with allies about future funding and he would share details with MPs \"as it evolves\".",
      "Earlier, a former defence chief of staff said he believed the decision to hike UK defence spending has been \"accelerated\" by President Donald Trump's actions on Ukraine.",
      "General Sir David Richards said the decision to raise defence spending over the next two years was a sound strategic move, but one that \"almost certainly would not\" be happening if not for Trump.",
      "\"It was going to happen, it's now been accelerated by Donald Trump's actions, and all of us, I think, would say not before time,\" he told  BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Lord Richards stressed the British Army was currently \"very hollowed out indeed\" and suggested the \"army isn't big enough\" currently for British troops to be part of a rotation of European peacekeeping forces.",
      "Questions have been raised about the Labour government's U-turn on its manifesto pledge to raise international development funding to 0.7% of gross national income, with unease among some Labour MPs about the move.",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Labour backbencher Diane Abbott suggested the decision could increase the risk of conflict abroad, telling the PM that \"there is also a view that taking money from aid and development to spend on armaments and tanks makes people less safe, not more safe, because the desperation and poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter.\"",
      "The PM defended the decision in the chamber, and earlier Healey had said \"hard power is now more important than soft power\".",
      "Asked whether the increase announced on Tuesday is linked to Sir Keir's visit to the White House, Healey told the Today programme: \"President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge.",
      "\"He's reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way.\"",
      "The US has been warning European leaders it wants to see a significant increase in their defence contributions to Nato for at least a decade.",
      "Trump's rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin, and the US siding with Russia on a UN resolution on Ukraine, has sent shockwaves through European allies.",
      "Asked whether he believed the UK increasing its defence contribution would bring Trump on side, Healey said that the PM could now tell Trump: \"You are challenging Europe and the UK to step up on European security, on Ukraine, on defence spending, on reinforcing our industrial base.",
      "\"We are, and we will step up further.\"",

      "\"The bereaved and the survivors and members of the Grenfell community are still waiting for the justice they need and deserve,\" Rayner said, \"and justice must be done\".",
      "The government said it is already working on a list of reforms to building safety which came from the cladding crisis following Grenfell, and that it will begin implementing the changes from 2028.",
      "The fire in the west London tower block killed 72 people in 2017. The inquiry found all their deaths were avoidable.",
      "It concluded that the fire was the result of a chain of failures by governments, \"dishonest\" companies and the fire service, which lacked a strategy for dealing with high rise cladding fires.",
      "Rayner, who is also deputy prime minister, said the Grenfell Inquiry had uncovered \"serial incompetence and negligence, complacency and inaction, and blatant dishonesty and greed\" which led to the fire.",
      "She said the government was acting on its findings and would take \"tough action\" to reform the system and \"ensure no community will ever have to face a tragedy like Grenfell ever again\".",
      "\"That means greater accountability, stronger regulation, and putting residents at the heart of decision-making,\" she added, saying it was owed \"to the memory of those who lost their lives\".",

      "Manufacturers either concealed evidence of the risks their products posed or made false and misleading claims, the inquiry found.",

    "story": [
      "Farmers protesting at government changes to agricultural inheritance tax rules have briefly disrupted a minister's speech at a national conference.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed was met with horns from tractors parked outside and protesters who silently unfurled banners in front of him as he outlined farming reforms, which included plans to focus on food production and make the industry more resilient to disruption.",
      "Reed told the hundreds gathered at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference that he could not give them \"the answer many of you want on inheritance tax\" but he understood the strength of feeling in the room.",
      "NFU president Tom Bradshaw told the annual conference on Tuesday the inheritance tax changes were \"morally wrong and economically flawed\".",
      "Under the government's planned changes, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",
      "The government has previously said that the changes will only impact the wealthiest 500 farms each year, a number disputed by farmers unions which estimate up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "Mr Bradshaw, whose speech was also briefly interrupted by two protesters who appeared to be urging people to be vegan, said the government had broken promises made before the election and had increased the mental health pressures on farmers, calling for it to correct the tax policy \"urgently'.",
      "\"We will fight this family farm tax until ministers do the right thing,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, this government needs a reset moment with farming, where they face up to the reality of how much the industry is struggling.\"",
      "Many farmers argue that while they are asset rich, for example in terms of their land or livestock, they are cash poor and the proposed changes would mean they would have to sell up in order to pay the tax.",
      "What is inheritance tax, who pays it and what's changing for farmers?",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "In his speech, Reed had also outlined plans for a 25-year farming roadmap and food strategy, which would put food production at its core and make farm businesses more resilient to challenges such as severe flooding, drought and animal disease.",
      "He said it would ensure farming is a \"sector which recognises restoring nature is not in competition with sustainable food production, but is essential to it\".",
      "As farmers outside the conference centre sounded their tractor horns, he announced measures including extending the seasonal worker visa scheme for five years, support for precision breeding and new technology.",
      "He also announced new requirements for government catering contracts to favour \"high quality, high welfare products that British producers are well placed to meet\".",
      "Earlier in the day, a multi-generational farming family - Martin Towler, his daughter and son-in-law, Hazel and Tom Church, and their five-year-old son Bertie - went to the Treasury to handover a collection of pre-loved farming toys donated by farmers who might be hit by the government's proposed changes to agricultural inheritance tax.",
      "The family have been farming Scald End Farm, a mixed beef and sheep farm in north Bedfordshire, since the 1940s but they all now also have to work off farm to supplement their income.",
      "They say the impact of the proposed inheritance tax changes will leave them facing a \u00a3400,000 bill and the prospect of selling off so much of the 210-acre farm that it would become unviable as a business.",
      "Mr Church said he hoped the government would listen to farmers' concerns and try to find a compromise on its inheritance tax policy.",
      "He told the BBC the changes, as currently proposed, would have a \"detrimental\" impact on the family's ability to run a profitable business.",
      "\"We are struggling at the moment as it is. There's no two ways about that,\" he said.",
      "\"Farming is incredibly low return on investment when you look at the asset values of the land and the income generated.",
      "\"If we are saddled with further debt through death - is it viable? Selling land is going to make it even less viable.\"",

      "During Tuesday's conference in Westminster - the first time it has been held outside Birmingham for years - Reed, took questions from the audience.",
      "There was clear anger among those questioning him on the tax changes and he was told many older farmers \"were wishing their lives away\" and now felt they would benefit their families by dying before the 2026 tax change.",

      "Under the bill, police would gain the power to enter and search a property without a court warrant for a stolen mobile phone or other items that have been electronically tracked, such as laptops or Bluetooth-tagged bikes.",
      "The power would mean that victims of mobile phone thefts who track their device while it is in the hands of a criminal could call on police to recover it quickly.",
      "Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she understood the \"incredible frustration\" of phone theft victims who say \"I can track it, I can see where it is - it's in this particular house, it's in this particular location\".",
      "\"And yet the police can't act fast enough to be able to track it down,\" she added.",
      "Cooper said \"we have to have the stronger powers and action [and] the police say they welcome this\".",
      "Asked about the reliability of locator apps, where people can use another device to help track down the location of their missing or stolen phone, being used in police searches, Cooper told BBC Breakfast: \"Police will have to make decisions [and] it will need to be signed off by a police inspector, and [they will] need to make decisions about where the evidence is good enough for them to be able to act.\"",
      "She added that the bill would include scrapping a \"ludicrous\" \u00a3200 threshold for shoplifting, which meant lower value thefts were not currently prioritised by police.",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins told Sky News she was \"deeply concerned\" that no longer treating shoplifting below \u00a3200 as a summary-only offence would have significant long-term effects on crown courts, saying \"victims of rape will find it even harder and longer to get their day in court\".",
      "But Cooper said addressing lower value thefts which were not likely to lead to prison would stop criminal behaviour escalating to the stage where such sentences would apply.",
      "The bill also includes the government's proposed \"Respect Orders\" - court-imposed restrictions that will be similar to the Asbo developed in the Tony Blair era, then scrapped by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats coalition a decade ago.",
      "While Asbos were popular with voters, critics say the restrictions often became unworkable or poorly enforced.",
      "The proposed Respect Orders allow courts to impose restrictions on an individual's behaviour, just like an Asbo.",
      "But they would also be able to compel them to attend programmes such as addiction treatment or anger management courses to change their ways.",

      "An offence of assaulting a shop worker - also a Conservative commitment before the 2024 General Election.A new police power to seize without warning off-road bikes or e-scooters.A new offence of spiking drinks, separate to current assault laws.Giving judges the power to issue a Stalking Prevention Order against a suspect, even if they are not convicted of a crime.",

      "Restaurant and retail bosses have written to Cooper to warn the bill \"stops short\" of protecting delivery riders under the plans. They want the new offence of threatening or assaulting a shop worker in their place of work to include couriers on journeys to and from customers.",
      "Cooper refused to be drawn on whether introducing new criminal offences would add unwelcome extra pressure on police, prisons, and the court system.",
      "Several police forces across England and Wales have previously warned they will have to make cuts to existing officers this year despite receiving extra funding, and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in December that prisons were at risk of running out of space.",
      "Cooper told the Today programme that a boost in police spending and increasing \"early prevention action\" would help prevent crimes escalating and prison sentences needing to be imposed, while community measures like tagging and curfews would also be strengthened.",
      "The Home Office says the bill's aims will be delivered by recruiting 13,000 additional neighbourhood officers by 2029 - and the department has pledged \u00a3200m specifically towards that.",

    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

    "story": [
      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.",
      "Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.",
      "1. A surprise letter to Trump from King Charles",
      "Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.",
      "Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.",
      "Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"",
      "After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting",
      "Trump's letter from the King: What does it say and what does it mean?",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.",
      "Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".",
      "2. Trump wanted to take charge",
      "While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.",
      "The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.",
      "A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.",
      "Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.",
      "At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.",
      "Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.",
      "3. The similarities between Starmer and Trump",
      "To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.",
      "But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"",
      "What else do they share? Trump said: \"We like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country.\"",
      "But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.",
      "4. Starmer a 'tough negotiator'",
      "Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference the president called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".",
      "Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".",
      "Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".",
      "5. Trump 'minded' to accept UK's Chagos deal",
      "Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.",
      "The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.",
      "The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.",
      "But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".",
      "6. 'Did I say that?' Trump walks back comments on Zelensky",
      "Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.",
      "An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"",
      "In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".",
      "Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.",
      "7. Starmer hits back at free speech criticism",
      "At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"",
      "Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".",
      "That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

    "story": [
      "Andrew and Tristan Tate, the controversial British-American social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, have been freed from travel restrictions in Romania after several high-level White House officials took an interest in their case.",
      "It's unclear what, if any, role Donald Trump's administration may have played in their release, but one of Trump's top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month.",
      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",
      "On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.",
      "Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.",
      "What is the White House saying?",
      "When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"",
      "But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania.",
      "Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers' case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times.",
      "And Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich.",
      "Hurezeanu said the Tates were mentioned during that conversation, but denied being pressured to release the pair.",

      "Why are the Tate brothers in the US?",

      "The Tate brothers are Trump supporters and also have ties to figures in his administration.",
      "One of Tate's lawyers now works as White House liaison to the US justice department.",
      "Paul Ingrassia was part of a team representing the Tate brothers in a defamation lawsuit they filed in Florida against several of their alleged victims.",
      "Ingrassia also acted as Tate's publicist and says he got the influencer onto a show hosted by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host.",
      "He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".",
      "Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.",
      "Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"",
      "The statement alleged that the Tates and others are victims of \"weaponised legal systems\" and \"politically motivated prosecutions\".",
      "McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.",
      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",
      "Like many other extreme influencers, in the face of criticism he often claims his posts are satire or jokes, mocking his detractors as his messages spread further, propelled by online outrage.",

      "Trump supporters split",
      "The pair's supporters were thrilled with his release and eager to proclaim their innocence, despite the outstanding charges against them.",
      "Four British women who have filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate meanwhile issued a statement calling on UK authorities to \"take action\", saying they were \"in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news\".",
      "And support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers.",
      "Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where Tates landed on Thursday, said of their activities: \"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct.\"",
      "The state's attorney general later said he would open a preliminary inquiry into the Tates and said Florida has \"zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women\".",
      "In the conservative Washington Examiner, podcaster Brady Leonard wrote: \"Tate's obnoxious, misogynistic brand is toxic to everyone besides electorally insignificant corners of social media.\"",
      "Matt Lewis, a US conservative political commentator who has been critical of Trump in the past, said advocating on behalf of Tate \"fits in with the ethos of the Maga world right now, which is: 'let's be tough guys'\".",
      "\"But I also think it speaks to a legitimate problem, which we have seen in the last couple decades, a problem with men...where there's an epidemic of loneliness, a sense the world is passing them by, a sense that modernity has made it harder to be successful as a husband and a father. I think that's had some real psychic effects,\" he said.",

      "The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite \u2013 cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it.",
      "There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind \u2013 and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic.",
      "Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later.",
      "But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence.",
      "The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. \"It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy,\" as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance.",
      "Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two.",

    "summary": "The government wants to adopt a scheme which encourages inmates to gain qualifications and take jobs.",
    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.",
      "The decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.",
      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",
      "The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum.",

      "The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.",
      "Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.",
      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",
      "Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.",
      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",
      "The scientists believe the skull gave some protection to the brain.",

      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",

      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",

      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",

    "story": [
      "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.",
      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",
      "Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.",
      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",

    "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

      "It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free.",
      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",
      "In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.",
      "Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News.",
      "First released in 2003, Skype was bought by the tech giant in 2011 for $8.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) - its biggest-ever acquisition at the time.",
      "As Microsoft once outlined, Skype became integrated with the company's other products such as Xbox and Windows devices.",

      "\"Skype was such an exciting invention at the time - before smartphones and WhatsApp calls,\" she said.",
      "\"It's so easy to assume that we've always been able to freely talk to people across the world but that's such a recent development really.\"",
      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",

      "The emotions are raw and the scene deeply distressing, with both brothers in tears and Eitan pleading to Benjamin Netanyahu to stick with the ceasefire deal and release all remaining hostages.",
      "The video is clearly designed, once again, to play on the frayed emotions of the Israeli public and heap pressure on the Israeli prime minister.",

      "This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security.",
      "This was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent.",
      "Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party.",
      "His speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics.",
      "Yet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson.",
      "Vance accused him of \"moralistic garbage\", \"historical illiteracy\" and - worst of all - of being a \"globalist\".",
      "And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week.",
      "Out of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens\".",
      "The prime minister pushed back firmly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\u2026 We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "This was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms.",
      "The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.",
      "Several questions present themselves. Was Vance's attack on Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe?",
      "White House sources have told US papers it was not.",
      "Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to dish out punishment to the president's opponents?",
      "Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again?",
      "Whatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.",
      "The impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding.",
      "Each season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.",

      "\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"",

She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.",
      "\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.",

      "The cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.",
      "Long queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.",

      "The email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.",
      "\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.",
      "He and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.",
      "\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added.",
      "Following a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.",
      "\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.",
      "\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.",
      "Outdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.",
      "\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.",
      "Some of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.",
      "Meanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.",
      "Concerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.",
      "Wildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.",
      "\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.",
      "\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\""

      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",

    "title": "Can Europe deter Russia in Ukraine without US military?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjeejw9z4zo",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 16:16:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump will not get involved in security guarantees for Ukraine, but can Europe fill the gap?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass.",
      "When asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: \"The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves.\"",
      "However, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia.",
      "In public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops.",
      "\"Too small\" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.",
      "According to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP.  In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.",
      "President Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests.",
      "He suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others.  It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?",
      "The short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.",
      "Britain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending.",
      "But Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.",
      "Instead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.",
      "That force would be focused on providing \"reassurance\" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.",
      "Can Europe still count on the US coming to its defence?",
      "How much do Nato members spend on defence?",
      "Hegseth sets out hard line on European defence and Nato",
      "But these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US \"backstop\" - \"to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia\" and to \"give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely\".",
      "Officials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a \"command and control element\" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities.",
      "It could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons.",
      "While Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided \"the cream\" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems.",
      "European nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics.",
      "Nato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.",
      "But Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough.",
      "But the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee.",
      "Europe's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground.",
      "France is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same. Some Northern European nations - Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic states - are willing to consider a commitment, but again would like US security guarantees. Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed.",
      "Sir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force.  But as for Donald Trump's question - would  Britain be able to take on Russia's military? Even though Russian forces have been weakened, the answer is no."

    "story": [
      "The day began with the same cordial routine the White House reserves for visiting foreign dignitaries.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was welcomed by US President Donald Trump at the door of the West Wing with an honour guard, and the leaders shook hands politely.",
      "We were in the Oval Office as part of Ukrainian media pool, witnessing the well-rehearsed formalities and about half an hour of polite talk.",

      "Trump complimented Zelensky's clothing.",
      "So far, so diplomatic.",
      "But minutes later, what erupted was unprecedented to say the least. The genial tone devolved into acrimony and chaos. Voices were raised, eyes rolled, aspersions cast - and all in front of the world's TV cameras.",
      "The US president and vice-president berated the visiting leader, accusing Zelensky of not being grateful enough for US support that has sustained Ukraine's war effort.",
      "Tensions flared when Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.",
      "What kind of diplomacy, Zelensky replied.",
      "Talking over the Ukrainian president, Vance told the visiting leader it was \"disrespectful\" for him to come to the Oval Office and make his case in front of the American media and demanded that he thank Trump for his leadership.",
      "Journalists in the room watched with gaping mouths as an extraordinary exchange followed.",
      "\"You've done enough talking. You're not winning this,\" Trump told him at one point. \"You gotta be thankful. You don't have the cards.\"",
      "\"I'm not playing cards,\" Zelensky replied. \"I'm very serious, Mr President. I'm the president in a war.\"",
      "\"You're gambling with World War Three,\" Trump responded. \"And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.\"",
      "Vance retorted: \"Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting? No.\"",
      "Ukraine's ambassador to the US watched with her head in her hands.",
      "The atmosphere had shifted entirely - and all out in the open.",
      "Our American colleagues remarked that they had never seen anything like it. \"A scene like this was simply unimaginable in the White House,\" one told me.",
      "As reporters exited the Oval Office, many stood still in a state of shock. In the White House briefing room, where the exchange was replayed shortly afterwards, the rest of the media who hadn't been in the room watched in disbelief.",
      "Confusion ensued. There were immediate questions about whether the planned news conference would go ahead \u2013 or if the much-anticipated deal between the US and Ukraine over mineral resources would even be signed.",
      "Minutes later, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Zelensky could \"come back when he is ready for peace\".",
      "The news conference and deal-signing ceremony - set to take place in the East Room of the White House - was officially cancelled.",
      "Soon after Zelensky strode out and into a waiting SUV, as his ambassador trailed behind him.",
      "They pulled away as the world was only beginning to digest an extraordinary moment.",
      "Despite the full-blown argument, there may still be a minerals deal sooner or later.",
      "But one thing is certain: this visit by Zelensky will be remembered for entirely different reasons.",
      "The world saw first-hand how negotiations between the US and Ukraine are unfolding: they are difficult, emotional, and tense.",
      "It was clear that this was a tough negotiation for both parties.",
      "The gift of Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk's belt certainly didn't save the situation. And after this bout at the White House, the real question now is what this means for the war in Ukraine - and Zelensky's own future.",

    "story": [
      "These were already turbulent times in Romania.",
      "But as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.",
      "A country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.",
      "Was a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?",
      "Or are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?",
      "Minister questions why Tate brothers were allowed to leave Romania",
      "Did the White House help end the Tate brothers travel ban?",
      "Andrew Tate: The self-proclaimed misogynist",
      "As foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?",
      "\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin.",
      "Declining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.",
      "But if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.",
      "This is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.",
      "So, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.",
      "\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"",
      "\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.",
      "It is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House.",
      "Many in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.",
      "There is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.",
      "But the picture is not clear cut.",
      "President Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.",
      "Meanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.",
      "\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.",
      "\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.",
      "\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.",
      "As for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.",
      "The fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.",
      "And while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.",
      "\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case.",
      "The brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.",
      "In the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.",
      "With their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond.",
      "Clearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

      "Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.",
      "These are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.",
      "Then there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.",
      "\"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.",
      "North Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.",
      "Since then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.",
      "But after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.",
      "Last Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.",
      "Among them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.",
      "Ben Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.",
      "\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"",
      "Despite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"",
      "On his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.",
      "For now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.",
      "Set up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.",
      "Joe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.",
      "Joe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.",
      "\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"",
      "But according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.",
      "Covid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.",
      "It is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.",
      "Local guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.",
      "Even Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"",
      "The regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.",
      "\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.",
      "One of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.",
      "They knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"",
      "Such conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.",
      "Mike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.",
      "\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"",
      "For Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"",
      "But tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.",
      "\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.",
      "One conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

    "summary": "David Johansen, the gravelly-voiced singer, was last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls.",
    "story": [
      "David Johansen, the wiry, gravelly-voiced singer and last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls who later performed as his campy, pompadoured alter ego, Buster Poindexter, has died. He was 75.",
      "Johansen died Friday at his home in New York City, Jeff Kilgour, a family spokesperson told The Associated Press. It was revealed in early 2025 that he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumor.",
      "The New York Dolls were forerunners of punk and the band's style - teased hair, women's clothes and lots of makeup - inspired the glam movement that took up residence in heavy metal a decade later in bands like Faster Pussycat and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.",
      "\"When you're an artist, the main thing you want to do is inspire people, so if you succeed in doing that, it's pretty gratifying,\" Johansen told The Knoxville News-Sentinel in 2011.",
      "Rolling Stone once called the Dolls \"the mutant children of the hydrogen age\" and Vogue called them the \"darlings of downtown style, tarted-up toughs in boas and heels.\"",
      "\"The New York Dolls were more than musicians; they were a phenomenon. They drew on old rock 'n' roll, big-city blues, show tunes, the Rolling Stones and girl groups, and that was just for starters,\" Bill Bentley wrote in \"Smithsonian Rock and Roll: Live and Unseen.\"",
      "The band never found commercial success and was torn by internal strife and drug addictions, breaking up after two albums by the middle of the decade. In 2004, former Smiths frontman and Dolls admirer Morrissey convinced Johansen and other surviving members to regroup for the Meltdown Festival in England, leading to three more studio albums.",
      "In the '80s, Johansen assumed the persona of Buster Poindexter, a pompadour-styled lounge lizard who had a hit with the kitschy party single \"Hot, Hot, Hot\" in 1987. He also appeared in such movies as \"Candy Mountain,\" \"Let It Ride,\" \"Married to the Mob\" and had a memorable turn as the Ghost of Christmas Past in Bill Murray-led hit \"Scrooged.\"",
      "Johansen was in 2023 the subject of Martin Scorsese and David Tedeschi's documentary \"Personality Crisis: One Night Only,\" which mixed footage of his two-night stand at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle in January 2020 with flashbacks through his wildly varied career and intimate interviews.",
      "\"I used to think about my voice like: 'What's it gonna sound like? What's it going to be when I do this song?' And I'd get myself into a knot about it,\" Johansen told The Associated Press in 2023. \"At some point in my life, I decided: 'Just sing the (expletive) song. With whatever you got.' To me, I go on stage and whatever mood I'm in, I just claw my way out of it, essentially.\"",
      "David Roger Johansen was born to a large, working class Catholic family on Staten Island, his father an insurance salesman. He filled notebooks with poems and lyrics as a young man and liked a lot of different music - R&B, Cuban, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding.",
      "The Dolls - the final original lineup included guitarists Sylvain Sylvain and Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane and drummer Jerry Nolan - rubbed shoulders with Lou Reed and Andy Warhol in the Lower East Side of Manhattan the early 1970s.",
      "They took their name from a toy hospital in Manhattan and were expected to take over the throne vacated by the Velvet Underground in the early 1970s. But neither of their first two albums - 1973's \"New York Dolls,\" produced by Todd Rundgren, nor \"Too Much Too Soon\" a year later produced by Shadow Morton - charted.",
      "\"They're definitely a band to keep both eyes and ears on,\" read the review of their debut album in Rolling Stone, complementary of their \"strange combination of high pop-star drag and ruthless street arrogance.\"",
      "Their songs included \"Personality Crisis\" (\"You got it while it was hot/But now frustration and heartache is what you got\"), \"Looking for a Kiss\" (I need a fix and a kiss\") and a \"Frankenstein\" (Is it a crime/For you to fall in love with Frankenstein?\")",
      "Their glammed look was meant to embrace fans with a nonjudgmental, noncategorical space. \"I just wanted to be very welcoming,\" Johansen said in the documentary, \"'cause the way this society is, it was set up very strict - straight, gay, vegetarian, whatever... I just kind of wanted to kind of like bring those walls down, have a party kind of thing.\"",
      "Rolling Stone, reviewing their second album, called them \"the best hard-rock band in America right now\" and called Johansen a \"talented showman, with an amazing ability to bring characters to life as a lyricist.\"",
      "Decades later, the Dolls' influence would be cherished. Rolling Stone would list their self-titled debut album at No. 301 of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, writing \"it's hard to imagine the Ramones or the Replacements or a thousand other trash-junky bands without them.\"",
      "Blondie's Chris Stein in the Nolan biography \"Stranded in the Jungle\" wrote that the Dolls were \"opening a door for the rest of us to walk through.\" Tommy Lee of Motley Crue called them early inspirations.",
      "\"Johansen is one of those singers, to be a little paradoxical, who is technically better and more versatile than he sounds,\" said the Los Angeles Times in 2023. \"His voice has always been a bit of a foghorn - higher or lower according to age, habits and the song at hand - but it has a rare emotional urgency.",
      "The Dolls, representing rock at it's most debauched, were divisive. In 1973, they won the Creem magazine poll categories as the year's best and worst new group. They were nominated several times for The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame but never got in.",
      "\"Dirty angels with painted faces, the Dolls opened the box usually reserved for Pandora and unleashed the infant furies that would grow to become Punk,\" wrote Nina Antonia in the book \"Too Much, Too Soon.\" \"As if this legacy wasn't enough for one band, they also trashed sexual boundaries, savaged glitter and set new standards for rock 'n' roll excess.\"",
      "By the end of their first run, the Dolls were being managed by legendary promoter Malcolm McLaren, who would later introduce the Sex Pistols to the Dolls' music. Culture critic Greil Marcus in \"Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century\" writes the Dolls played him some of their music and he couldn't believe how bad they were.",
      "\"The fact that they were so bad suddenly hit me with such force that I began to realize, ''I'm laughing, I'm talking to these guys, I'm looking at them, and I'm laughing with them; and I was suddenly impressed by the fact that I was no longer concerned with whether you could play well,\" McLaren said. \"The Dolls really impressed upon me that there was something else. There was something wonderful. I thought how brilliant they were to be this bad.\"",
      "After the first demise of the Dolls, Johansen started his own group, the David Johansen band, before reinventing himself yet again in the 1980s as Buster Poindexter.",
      "Inspired by his passion for the blues and arcane American folk music Johansen also formed the group The Harry Smiths, and toured the world performing the songs of Howlin' Wolf with Hubert Sumlin and Levon Helm. He also hosted the weekly radio show \"The Mansion of Fun\" on Sirius XM and painted.",
      "He is survived by his wife, Mara Hennessey, and a stepdaughter, Leah Hennessey.",

Dylan's rise to fame is not immediate, being in the shadow of another star in folk music circles, Joan Baez (best supporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro).

She would later tour with Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue in the mid-'70s, and the two collaborated on projects into the '80s, with their '60s romantic association becoming fodder for memoirs, music treatises and documentaries. (Baez herself recalled her first impression of Dylan in her 1987 autobiography, \"And a Voice to Sing With\": \"His eyes were as old as God, and he was fragile as a winter leaf.\")",
      "Barbaro told the Los Angeles Times she understood Baez's attraction to Dylan. \"She fell in love with the poet, the person willing to say what he was willing to say. I think she fell in love with the words themselves and how he was saying things she was trying to find the words for,\" Barbaro said. \"And they were so young. If I try to unpack my relationships at 20 ... I can't imagine that being inspected on a public level for decades to come.\"",
      "To play Baez, Barbaro studied the guitar and took vocal lessons for a year to match Baez's incomparable soprano. \"Every conversation about Joan's voice, you hear about her vibrato, the key she sings in and the angelic quality. It was about getting those things so it was recognizable,\" she told the Times. \"I leaned into getting as close to her as possible. And on the day, you put the preparation on the shelf and receive the person in front of you in a real authentic moment.\"",
      "In this interview for Variety, Barbaro, costar Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Mangold discuss the singing sequences. Barbaro said, \"In terms of the music, I mean, it was important to all of us to not have a bunch of sort of carbon copies of these musicians, or any sort of sign of mimicry in the film, and yet they have to be recognizable versions of these musicians.\"",
      "Of the movie's message \u2014 how art used to address issues like social justice and war \u2014 Barbaro told the Times, \"The coolest thing about this film is getting to see audiences who lived then and [see them] feel like their time was understood.\"",
      "Barbaro studied dance and ballet while growing up in the Bay Area. She graduated from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, and acted in \"Chicago Justice,\" \"The Good Cop,\" and the Tom Cruise blockbuster \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" as Lt. Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace. This is her first Oscar nomination. She also received two Screen Actors Guild nominations for her performance.",

      "Based on the long-running Broadway musical, \"Wicked\" is a prequel to \"The Wizard of Oz,\" presenting the origin story of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. What was her relationship with the Good Witch of the East, and how did it turn so bad?",
      "The story is told in flashback through Glinda, the ravishingly popular student at Shiz University, where the two meet. Initially an outcast, Elphaba attracts the attention of a professor of magic, Madame Morrible \u2014 and Glinda finds herself eagerly trying to get into both their good graces, for her own advancement.",
      "Watch this excerpt of Glinda selling herself as a tutor to her new charge \u2014 best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo \u2014 in the ways of becoming \"Popular\":",
      "In 2018 Grande appeared alongside the stars of Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, in a televised concert celebrating the show's 15th anniversary, \"A Very Wicked Halloween.\" Grande sang \"The Wizard and I\" (which in the show is sung by Elphaba). Three years later, Grande had her first audition for the part of Glinda in the movie version.",
      "In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Grande discussed her audition process for \"Wicked,\" for which she sang \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and \"Popular.\" \"Even though it was very clear that I was going in for Glinda, I also sang 'The Wizard and I' and 'Defying Gravity' twice. \u2026 I just remember leaving buzzing,\" she said.",
      "The casting of Grande as Glinda, and Erivo as Elphaba, was universally praised, as they were seemingly born for the parts. Chenoweth, the actress who originated Glinda on stage, told \"Entertainment Tonight\" that when Grande won the role, the young singer called her: \"And we both squealed. She said, 'I need your help.' I said, 'You don't need my help. Just do you.'\"",
      "In December Grande was interviewed by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation about her performance in the film. \"I've loved these songs since I was 10 years old, and I've sung them for fun in the car, in the shower, growing up,\" she said. \"Even when I got older, when I was nervous to perform or something, I would turn to the soundtrack for comfort when I was warming up to do a show. It's just funny because when you spend time with the lyrics and dig into what's happening in-between the lines, you get to know what's happening in a very different way than just singing in a car.\"",
      "Grande described the questions she asked of her character: \"Why is she so fascinated with Elphaba? What is the magic that [Elphaba] has that Glinda doesn't? And what are her insecurities? And what's not on the page \u2014 what's motivating her to give [Elphaba] the hat, when deep down she doesn't want to?\"",
      "Months before her first audition, Grande worked with her vocal coach to prepare: \"The vocal cords, like any other muscle in the body, they're habitual; you have to train them to do new things. And I naturally have a high range and I sing whistle tones and I sing high notes, but it's very different than singing coloratura soprano, a classical operatic. I knew I wanted to go in for Glinda, so I wanted to train my voice as much as I could so that by the time my first audition came around it sounded authentic and warm and fully and truly like what's required of Glinda.\"",
      "Grande, who has won two Grammy Awards and reportedly sold more than 90 million records, previously appeared in \"Don't Look Up.\" This is her first Academy Award nomination.",

      "\"This script, when it came through, I think all of us involved knew that it was special,\" Jones told BBC Radio's \"Woman's Hour.\" \"It was unusual to read something that had this depth of character in it, and this huge epic sweeping story that's underpinned by these very intimate, domestic, very precisely drawn moments.",
      "\"I was incredibly moved by it fundamentally, and I felt that Erzs\u00e9bet was this magnificent character. She was someone who is completely unafraid of who she is. When we meet her, you realize she's been through incredible trauma; she's been through concentration camps alongside her husband (in different camps, but they've been through very similar experiences), and I felt there was a great challenge in conveying this woman's experience. She's incredibly accomplished; I do particularly like the line where, 'Did you not tell them anything about me?' \u00a0I think that could have only been written by a woman!\"",
      "Though physically weak and malnourished, Erzs\u00e9bet exhibits a powerful forthrightness, and a willingness to challenge others. \"You get to learn actually that she's exceptionally strong throughout the film,\" Jones said.",
      "Shooting on film (\"The Brutalist\" was produced in VistaVision, to be blown up to 70mm) was an added element of her performance versus shooting on digital, Jones told the audience at a New York Film Festival screening last fall. \"It gives more value to what you're doing because it feels somehow more precious,\" she said. \"It doesn't feel like you can just keep going and going for hours and hours. You know, in that moment when it's 'Action!' you do feel like you've got to make, you've got to perform in that moment. And everyone does \u2014 cast, crew, everyone has to give their best, because it's not limitless, and [celluloid] costs a fortune!\"",

And so, it was fantastic to play a role where I don't have any lines, but everybody's a little bit afraid of me!\"",
      "She told the Los Angeles Times that she used the limitations of her character to her advantage: \"We had three or four days of rehearsal, but I was nervous,\" she said. \"I thought maybe Sister Agnes would be nervous, too, so I used that. I didn't have to repress it. She's not part of the brawl with the men. She doesn't get into the opinion of who should be the next pope.

You know it takes discipline to not sort of, like, judge a character as you're approaching it and you're putting it together. You kind of go, 'Well, I wouldn't do what she did,' and it's like, 'Well there's no, it's not a she, it's an I, it's a me, and where am I? I'm desperate right now, I need a way out.

But after an hour-and-a-half Zoom call, during which Salda\u00f1a even sang, Audiard rewrote the part for her \u2014 and postponed shooting to accommodate Salda\u00f1a's schedule. And once she arrived in Paris for filming, she found the director drawing on the actress' own perspective for Rita. \"It felt like an experiment where we were finding things as we went, and that's how the first 'Avatar' was shot,\" she told The Times. \"Ever since then, I've been searching for that high again of being with a seasoned, prolific director and having the director look at you going, 'I don't know, what do you think?'\"",

    "summary": "Colt Ford had even undergone a preventative check-up that found no signs of concern before he had a \"silent\" heart attack on tour.",
    "story": [
      "Country star Colt Ford doesn't remember the day he had a life-threatening heart attack.",
      "He and his band performed at Whiskey Row, a venue in Gilbert, Arizona, on April 4, 2024, but Ford told CBS News that he has no memory of the show. He also doesn't remember the moments after the show, when he returned to the tour bus and collapsed.",
      "\"One of my guys just happened to walk back on the bus and find me already slumped over,\" Ford, a former professional golfer, said.",
      "Ford had experienced a massive heart attack. His bandmates called for help and started performing CPR. First responders took him to an area hospital, where he underwent a 10-hour surgery. He flat-lined twice, Colt said, and his heart had to be shocked back into beating.",
      "After the surgery, he was transferred to the Mayo Clinic, where he was kept in a medically induced coma for eight days. He was also put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, a form of machine support that helps the heart and lungs.",
      "No one, including Ford, had noticed any symptoms of the heart attack. Ford had undergone a check-up before his tour that found no problems, he said. He had recently lost weight and thought he was in good shape, and he was 53 years old at the time. His bandmates remembered the night as one of the best shows of their tour, and videos from the night show Ford active on stage.",
      "\"I woke up eight days later, and I don't remember any of it,\" Ford, now 54, said. \"I had no concept of it.\"",
      "Do heart attacks always have symptoms?",
      "Heart attacks don't always have symptoms, according to Dr. Sawella Guseh, a cardiologist at Mass General Brigham who was not involved in Ford's care. The phenomenon hasn't been closely studied, so exact numbers of who does and doesn't have symptoms don't exist, he said, but silent heart attacks do make up a \"significant\" number of cases.",
      "Some groups are more prone to \"silent heart attacks,\" Guseh said. That includes people with diabetes, who may have nerve damage from high blood sugar, meaning their nerves can't alert their brains about the problems in the heart. Athletes and\u00a0those with a high pain tolerance may not notice the symptoms, Guseh said.",
      "Any shortness of breath after activities that don't normally make someone breathless should be considered a symptom, he said. Even something seemingly unrelated to the cardiac system, like tooth pain after exertion, could be a sign that your heart is in danger.",
      "\"I pretty much tell everybody, it's not just chest pain, it's anything that can happen with exertion between your ears and your belly button,\" Guseh said. \"Your brain doesn't actually have a signature for the heart. The nerves from the heart that go to the brain are actually the same ones that come up from the stomach, so the brain is like 'Something's up, but I don't actually know if that's my heart or anything else.'\"",
      "Most people who have a heart attack or cardiac episode experience things like chest tightness or pressure. More unusual symptoms might include pain in the neck and jaw or in their shoulder. Women may be more likely to experience these kinds of symptoms, CBS News previously reported.",
      "\"I'll say that usually when you go back and ask, you can find something that was a little bit off,\" Guseh said. \"But there are people where, yeah, they actually felt absolutely nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't know how much more dire it can be\"",
      "Dr. Kwan S. Lee, the Mayo Clinic cardiologist who led Ford's care team, said the country singer most likely experienced a sudden artery block, which can cause the heart to stop abruptly. Keeping him alive afterwards required \"the whole village,\" Lee said. In addition to ECMO, Ford received multiple stents to open the blocked arteries in his heart. Weaning him off ECMO took more work, Lee said, and his care team had to ensure that he didn't get any infections that could pose further danger.",
      "When Ford opened his eyes after eight days in a coma, he was too weak to even lift a Styrofoam cup of ice chips, he told CBS News. His wife and son were by his side, and his doctor filled him in on what had happened over the past several days.",
      "\"I was really, really, really sick. I died twice,\" Ford said. \"My doctor said I was 1% of the 1%. I don't know how much more dire it can be than that.\"",
      "Even though he was awake, that wasn't the end of his journey.",
      "Ford underwent a fasciotomy to relieve pressure that had built up in his leg while he was asleep. He also had lost sensation in one leg below the knee. Once the conditions were treated, he had to begin physiotherapy and start a pharmaceutical regimen that would keep his heart stable even after he left the hospital. Ford said that process included learning \"how to walk again,\" while also focusing on his mental health.",
      "\"I'd never been through anything like that. We've all had injuries. As an athlete and musician, you learn to play through things, you play through pain. I've played shows with kidney stones,\" Ford said. \"But this wasn't that. I was helpless there for a while.\"",
      "Recovering and returning to music",
      "Ford went home from the hospital several weeks after waking up. He continued cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy there. He has also urged fans, friends and family to learn from his story and take stock of their own health.",
      "\"All my friends, all my buddies, they're all going to the doctor,\" Ford said. \"Everybody thought 'Oh, Colt's doing good. He's lost all that weight. He's great.' And then I wake up eight days later.\"",
      "His goal, he said, was always to get back on stage. After almost a year of recovery, he's getting ready to do just that: In a few months, he plans to join fellow musician Brent Lee Gilbert for a few shows.",
      "He said he's been dealing with anxiety related to returning to performing. It's something he's never experienced before, he said, but he hopes the appearances will make it possible to \"progress a little bit further and see what we can do on our own.\"",
      "While recovering, he's still had time for music. On Feb. 21, he released his first single since the heart attack. The song, \"Hell Out Of It,\" had been nearly complete when he collapsed, but the brush with death gave it new meaning.",
      "\"That fear of the unknown is such a real thing. You're told that when you're young, that it all goes fast, and I didn't believe at that, you know? Like, oh, that's just something old people tell you,\" Ford said. \"And now it's like, every day, I'm like 'Wow, you better pay attention, because it can change in the blink of an eye.'\"",

      "\"I'd like to say hi to my mom. Unfortunately, she's watching Ted Koppel. That's her idea of a son!\"",
      "\u2014 Johnny Carson, outset of The Tonight Show monologue, August 6, 1982 (ten weeks before his 57th birthday",
      "\"One got the impression that Johnny's relationship with his mother was complex. Once, when I came into his office, he told me that his mother had just angrily hung up on him. I asked why, and he said, 'I called and asked her how things were going. She said, \"Not so good. Yesterday, we put Walter Burbage in the ground.\" I said, 'Was he dead?'\"",
      "\u2014Emailed anecdote from Carson monologue writer Michael Barrie",
      "The complexities of Ruth Elizabeth Hook Carson\u2014woman of grand flair and mannered propriety, poker-game hellcat, preternaturally withholding, crisp, exacting, colorful, misunderstood\u2014imbued her son Johnny, in particular, with even deeper complexities. But without them, he would not have grown into what he needed to be. Which is how it has worked, vis-\u00e0-vis powerful men re: their mothers, since time and nimble psyches began ticking. Arguably, traces of this mother mixed throughout the bulk content of her middle child's infamous tightly packed suitcase. The parts of her that he would directly adopt into his own makeup were also, in no small measure, the same parts of her to which he was forced to adapt\u2014or steel himself against\u2014from tender years onward.",
      "So it followed that he had sired three sons who would also never quite believe they were unconditionally adored (or, at times, much cared for) \u2014no matter that his own cloistered heart wanted far better for them than he had ever gotten. Demonstrating the difference, of course, was the big hitch, since no affirming example had been drummed into him. Instead, his protectiveness for the boys showed up as a brisk tough love (with sweet dashes of twinkle)\u2014which mostly left them wanting, especially in a household that grew more and more unstable and where their father was mostly missing in action. Thus, the circle stayed unbroken\u2014a fact he would later grasp with sizable remorse. Except it was a frozen, paralytic remorse that all but stymied him from correcting matters. \"It was very hard,\" says Suzanne Pleshette, who saw the toll of these struggles across many years. \"I know all of the children of all of the big stars. And all of these kids have a lot of legitimate complaints\u2014and yet it's these guys' demons that made them who they are, and also who their children ended up becoming. Johnny's relationship with his sons was difficult and bittersweet\u2014especially knowing that he felt that he hadn't given what they deserved to have. In some ways, he had probably replicated what was painful for him. And he didn't quite have the ability to know how to fix it.\"",
      "At best, he did find a way to address that niggling impulse\u2014by proxy, anyway. Long after the die was cast and the boys had become men, he would softly bolster younger fathers who found themselves in grim marital straits, almost wistfully forking over his two cents in a manner akin to don't-do-as-I-do-just-do-as-I-say. (It was a singular exception to his tendency to stifle advice dispensation.) The comedian and fail-safe guest Robert Klein, whose only child, a son, was born in 1983, had been one such beneficiary\u2014absorbing repeated doses of concern during Tonight Show commercial breaks (which was when the host deigned to socialize, selectively but also genuinely, with preferred or privileged seat-fillers). \"He was very, very kind to me when I was going through a terrible divorce [in 1988],\" Klein told People. \"He advised me to make sure to let my boy know that I love him very much, and he kept telling me this over and over.\"",
      "Like any comedy pro, Johnny Carson knew that misadventures in fatherhood were tantamount to gold, especially after intervening years, or decades, had diluted whatever traumas may have been part of the payoff. (See comedy theorem of tragedy-plus-time-equals-funny.) Like the night of December 10, 1981, when he was caught, post-commercial break, interacting with his Burbank studio constituency: \"I was telling the audience the story about the guinea pigs,\" he explained to viewers, a bit ominously. \"I don't want to repeat it\u2014maybe later. But never buy your children little guinea pigs in New York and then put them outside at night. They were hard as a carp!\" This material, of course, was basically the benign stuff of typical suburban cocktail party patter\u2014except his shaggy parenting tales were magnified via coast-to-coast broadcast, albeit in distant aftermath. \"I know my dad enjoyed wearing the mantle of fatherhood with his friends and acquaintances,\" Carson's youngest son Cory mordantly notes. \"Always been a part of the irony for me. And it's okay.\"",
      "But The Tonight Show was always going to be where he shared himself most generously (eking out, via chatty dollops of personal history, the autobiography he refused to write) and, during those confessional or conversational asides, his sons' names and pursuits would often trip eagerly\u2014and proudly\u2014from his tongue. As these things went, his fame would certainly, if unintentionally, form their lives as much as he fought against it by leaning hard on them. Phil Donahue aimed in early 1970 to pry open that worm-can, asking him: \"When you first signed an autograph in front of your kids, how did they respond? Did it affect them in a way that undermines your ability to be their father?\" To which he replied, after a confounded pause, \"I don't know. It's hard to ask your own children.\"",
      "Email from Cory Carson, August 2, 2005: \u00a0My feelings about my Dad are quite mixed. Professionally he was without a doubt most suited for the career he sought. \u00a0The right man for the job and ... at the right time in history. On the personal side of the coin, he left his kids and family as a consequence to [pursue] that professional end and, as a result, made life most difficult for those left to watch the \"magic\" unfold without the benefit of experiencing it with him. I think he was typical of most entertainers \u00a0in that area though, so whaddaya gonna do? Work was easy for him, family was not.",
      "Email from Cory Carson, August 3, 2005: \u00a0I understand my dad's foibles better than any, been a lifetime study. \u00a0I am free of feeling unworthy though, that was a biggie many years ago. \u00a0Imagine witnessing the little guests that would frequent the show and having my Dad absolutely enthralled with their every word. What did they have that we didn't? Ten minutes of material! Hey!!! (snare-kick sound) \u00a0Show bidness. Gotta love it.",
      "***",
      "While Carson's love for his sons rarely manifested in hugs and attaboys, it was nonetheless tucked away in subterranean seams awaiting extraction. On June 21, 1991, it exploded to the surface. Carson was only a month into his valedictory season when, toward the end of a two-week vacation, he learned that his son and middle child, Rick, had died in a car accident near Morro Bay, on the Southern California coast. Investigators determined that the thirty-nine-year-old amateur photographer had likely been taking or setting up for photos when his SUV plunged 125 feet down an embankment, fatally injuring him. There was talk of Carson's returning to The Tonight Show as scheduled, but he was too devastated and needed more time. Only a few weeks later, however, he was back on the job.",
      "\"The first time I spoke with him [on the phone], I didn't know what to say,\" says Helen Sanders, Carson's longtime executive assistant. \"The thing that came out of my mouth was 'I just wish I could give you a big hug.' Afterward, I thought, What a stupid thing to say! Why did I say that? \u00a0I felt so dumb. The day he came [back] to do the show, the first thing I noticed is that he had no energy. He always had a sparkling energy; you could see the sparks come off him. But he was like a shell. It scared me. I said, 'Hi.' I didn't really know what to say; I was trying to act normal. He just stood there and said, 'Can I have that hug?' I got up, and I just gave him a big hug. We hugged and cried together. I felt him just take my energy. I feel really good about the fact that I made a really safe, calm place for him to be that afternoon.\"",
      "When Carson's writers gathered that day for their regular meeting, he told them, \"Don't ever go through this, guys.\" Then it was business as usual, the show going on as it must. Rick had been a second assistant director on the pilot for Amen, recalls Ed. Weinberger, a short-lived Carson Productions president and former Tonight Show writer. \"But he wasn't prepared to work, and I feel very bad about that. That's a very serious regret that I was not more patient or understanding\u2014but [we were] in the midst of doing the show and with actors saying, 'He can't do his job' and 'I didn't come out of my dressing room because I didn't know that I was due.'\" There were all kinds of things, so I let him go. He called me one night when he had obviously been drinking, and he said, 'I know why ... I understand ... You're a lot like my father \u2026' He went on for thirty-five, forty minutes just rambling about who he was, what he was. He was lost.\" Rick's pal Danny Robinson, son of Tonight Show talent manager Bud Robinson, knew him on a much different level. \"He was hilarious\u2014killer sense of humor,\" Robinson says, adding that of Carson's sons, Rick most closely reflected his father. \"He had the same sort of energy, the same sense of humor.\" Carson, too, saw the resemblance, telling second ex Joanne that \"he was so like me in so many ways.\" But Carson could be cold and cruel. According to Tonight Show associate producer Tom Boles, \"there was not a mean bone in [Rick's] body. I think his own individuality was so eclipsed by Johnny's mega-stardom that he was unable to exist as his own individual. It was impossible for him to be anything more than Johnny's son.\" Boles also notes, \"I would see [Johnny's youngest son] Cory in the halls of NBC. He'd be around the Tonight Show irregularly. You could tell he didn't bear that same weight that Rick did. It's hard to put your finger on Rick. There was something troubled about him. You kind of felt bad for the guy.\" After Rick died, Danny and Boles attended a memorial that Rick's girlfriend and some of his friends held at the tiny and historic Little Brown Church, on Coldwater Canyon Avenue in Studio City. Attendees received laminated memorial cards that bore one of Rick's lush landscape photos\u2014a blue sky, brown mountains, and water. On its flip side were Rick's birthdate and words typically attributed to Scottish poet Thomas Campbell: \"To live in the hearts of those you leave behind is not to die.\" By Robinson's account, former Tomorrow Show host (and Rick's former boss when he worked on the program as a stage manager and associate director) Tom Snyder attended. So did various Tonight Show staffers, people from the Today show, and others who'd known Rick. \"Johnny didn't come, and I get it,\" Robinson says. \"I buried my parents, and that was as hard as anything I ever want to do in my life. And I've buried, unfortunately, enough friends. I can't imagine burying your child. But here's what Johnny said: 'Where I go, the press will go. I don't want it to turn into a circus.' Personally, I would have loved for Johnny to be there because he would have gotten to see a side of Ricky that maybe he never saw.\" During Rick's stint at the Tomorrow Show, he'd become friends with producer and director Andy Friendly (son of CBS legend Fred Friendly). \"His death, following a difficult time in his life, was devastating to me, and to all of his friends and Tomorrow Show colleagues,\" Friendly wrote in an excerpt from his 2017 memoir Willing to Be Lucky: Adventures in Life and Television. \"I wrote a long letter to his dad expressing my sympathy and describing the kind, fun-loving, great person and colleague Rick was.\" Carson replied with a brief note of thanks.",
      "During the first Tonight Show taping after Rick's death, on July 17, 1991, Carson made no mention of the sensitive subject up top. (\"We were all on tenterhooks, walking on eggshells,\" Ed McMahon says. \"Worrying about how he was gonna do the show.\") Instead, he delivered a joke-filled monologue and interviewed guests Bernadette Peters (who also sang) and Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson before delivering a eulogy for Rick from behind his desk near the show's end. For such an interior and private man it was no small feat, and at times he stifled tears. Two days after Rick died, he said, Carson's good friend, the actor and director Michael Landon, had called to offer consolation. Landon was deeply unwell at the time and died of pancreatic cancer the following week. \"So these have not been the most happy several weeks,\" Carson said. With a photo of his handsome boy displayed on monitors\u2014not to be \"mawkish,\" he assured, but because it was a better representation than the driver's license shot used in press reports\u2014Carson described Rick as \"an exuberant young man, fun to be around. When Rick was around you wanted to smile.\" Carson briefly glanced off to the wings, where he could hear de Cordova on the phone with director Bobby Quinn, letting him know they were running long. De Cordova also flashed Carson a stunningly ill-timed sign to wrap things up. (The gaffe damaged their decades-long relationship, though they reportedly mended fences before de Cordova died in 2001.) Tamping down his anger like a musket ball, Carson went on as if nothing had happened: \"He tried so darn hard to please. He had a laugh that was contagious as could be. Luckily he left some marvelous memories for the whole family, and that's what you kind of hang on to.\" A montage of Rick's photographs followed, accompanied by Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble's languid jazzy-bluesy tune \"Riviera Paradise\"\u2014urban vistas and rural horizons; shores beneath mountains and crashing surf; a wildflower field and a poplar grove. (\"This one goes out to anyone who's suffering in any way,\" Vaughn said before an October 10, 1989, performance of the song at Austin City Limits.) The moving segment lasted five and a half minutes. Prolonged emotionalism, even in the wake of such a crushing personal loss, wasn't Carson's style. Offstage, though, his quiet grieving never ended. Recalling the impact of Rick's death two decades after it happened, Severinsen said, \"Johnny was never the same, ever, after that.\"",

      "Mirren's illustrious career includes an Academy Award\u00a0for \"The Queen,\" three Golden Globes, five Emmys and a Tony Award.

      "\"Anora,\" the Palme d'Or winner at last year's Cannes Film Festival, is a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of Anora, a Brooklyn sex worker, who enters into a Cinderella romance and marriage with the flighty son of Russian oligarchs. But Russian oligarchs are not to be taken lightly, nor the strongmen that are tasked with righting a perceived wrong.",
      "However, writer-director Sean Baker is not interested in familiar, stereotypical mob muscle.

      "Throughout most of the film, Borisov's performance is not dependent upon dialogue; he's an observer, an instrument of others, and a guardian. In this scene, Igor and Anora seem to recognize that \u2013   for all that has happened between them \u2013  there is nonetheless a connection that transcends their circumstances. Non-spoiler alert: I will not give away the actions preceding and following this clip, but they are at the heart of the film's tremendous emotional impact:",
      "In an interview for the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, Borisov was asked to describe his character's transition, from being a threat to Anora, to becoming a vulnerable, empathetic confidant, feeling things about her he didn't expect. [Indeed, Igor shows more compassion to Anora than anyone else in the movie.]",
      "\"I don't know how to answer, 'cause if I could explain it by words, I better to be a writer than an actor,\" he said. \"That's why I tried to explain by [actions]. It's thanks to Sean, his editing, because he used some right moments, and that's why you could feel what [Igor] feels. \u2026 And thanks to Mikey, she just going forward to her goal, I'm just going behind her and trying to help and protect. That's it.\"",
      "Borisov told the Associated Press that the theme of the film was about making connections: \"Connection between people, between mentalities and nationalities and cultures. Especially today, because I think that it's possible, this connection, between everybody of us. Of course, it's not easy. I know, and everybody knows, but it's possible. And during this shoot I feel this \u2013 that we are different but at the same time we're absolutely similar. And I feel that humans, in the most important things, are similar and I feel everybody of us like children and souls, you know. For me, it's about connection between souls, and it's possible.\"",
      "Born in Moscow, Borisov's credits include \"The Bull,\" \"Kalashnikov,\" \"Compartment No. 6,\" and the Netflix film \"Silver Skates.\" For his performance in \"Anora\" he received Golden Globe, BAFTA and two Screen Actors Guild nominations. He tied with Kieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\") for best supporting performance from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.",
      "He was in a car with his wife and two daughters when he heard the Oscar nominations being announced. \"My [category] was first, and my name was first.

      "Kieran Culkin won an Emmy Award for \"Succession,\" playing the snarky son of a tycoon whose media empire is seemingly up for grabs among his duplicitous offspring. In the movie \"A Real Pain,\" Culkin and Jesse Eisenberg (who wrote and directed) play cousins on a trip to Poland to see where their late beloved grandmother was raised \u2013 and take a Holocaust heritage tour.",
      "Culkin's character, Benji, is a charming but rudderless man-child. Asked why he connected with the role, Culkin told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"I don't really know what it was with me, but \u2026 I instantly knew who this guy was. I understood the dynamic, and I really wanted to play.\"",
      "Speaking of Benji, Culkin has described himself as being \"one quick little misstep away from being that person.\" That person is someone who \u2013 in his cousin's view \u2013 says the wrong thing, acts inappropriately, and raises the discomfort level in social situations.",
      "In this scene, Benji reacts to the absurdity of riding a train in comfort compared to the situation facing Jews on trains in 1940s Poland:",
      "\"I feel like I easily could've gone down that path,\" Culkin said of Benji. \"There was something in that that I recognized as myself, but I'm not that guy at all. But I think I'm worried that I easily could've become that guy, [had I not] married, kids, or figured out how to, you know, get my s*** together.\"",
      "Jesse Eisenberg, the writer-director of \"A Real Pain,\" told \"Sunday Morning\" he hadn't seen Culkin's work on-screen (he avoided watching \"Succession,\" he said, because he was afraid of how great it might be). But he had auditioned with him for 2009's \"Adventureland.\" \"He came into this audition room and started, like, beating me up like in the script and making fun of me\u2026 and being so brilliantly funny, and then walked out of the room, and we were like, 'That was brilliant and aggressive, fascinating and so brazen.' And so, when I was thinking about who would work well with me in this movie playing a character who comes on that trip that I plan and who kind of beats me up but also charms the group at my expense, I was thinking, Oh yeah, that's the relationship I had briefly with this brilliant actor \u2026 That seemed to me just so perfect.",
      "\"And then, Kieran showed up on set and within two seconds it just felt like we had been doing this for years.\"",

      "Edward Norton has previously been nominated for three Oscars \u2013 for playing a homicide defendant in \"Primal Fear,\" a neo-Nazi in \"American History X,\" and a Method actor in \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance).\" For \"A Complete Unknown,\" a biography of Bob Dylan, Norton portrays legendary folk singer Pete Seeger, who became a mentor of Dylan's.",
      "In this early scene, Seeger, having been found guilty of contempt of Congress for refusing to name names in a political witch hunt, responds to the developments with a patriotic song:",
      "Norton told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "Just one of the challenges: Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well. \"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "He said the film offered him a chance to channel greatness: \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",

      "Guy Pearce, \"The Brutalist\"",
      "In \"The Brutalist,\" architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (best actor nominee Adrien Brody) emigrates from post-war Europe to the United States, where he hopes to revive his career. He gets his chance with a job that tantalizes industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce).",
      "In this scene, Van Buren announces to T\u00f3th that he has decided he wants the architect, an apostle of the Brutalist style of architecture, to design a grand edifice in honor of his mother \u2013 a community center in the hinterlands of Pennsylvania. But Van Buren also hints that he doesn't expect T\u00f3th, or anyone, to deny him his wishes, as Van Buren begins to take ownership over T\u00f3th:",
      "At the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Pearce spoke of the dynamic between his character and that of Brody's: \"The interesting kind of position that Van Buren takes, or tries to take, in life generally is that he is the top dog, that he is the one in control, that he is the one who has the power, that he is the one who decides. And I think a lot of that does come from insecurity, from feeling powerless, from feeling like he's not in control. And he's worked his way to seemingly a position in life where he has the dominance. And yet, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 comes into his life, who he's intuitive enough and has enough taste to recognize not only his skill but also his artistry, etc. But the thing he really detects in L\u00e1szl\u00f3 is, I believe, sort of an underlying sense of self-confidence, an ability to see the truth of the world, where my character is ... whatever truth he's feeling within himself, he's masking, hiding, being presentational, etc.",
      "\"And so, I think the yearning for a man like this, to be a man like this, to perhaps possess a man like this is quite the mirror and quite the turmoil for Van Buren,\" Pearce said.",
      "Pearce described the dualism of his character in \"The Brutalist\" to the Associated Press: \"I'm really aware of how precarious we are as human beings \u2026 Good people can do bad things and bad people can do good things. Moment to moment, we're trying to just get through the day. We're trying to be good. And we can do good things for ourselves and other people, but pretty easily we can be tipped off course.\"",
      "\"There's a performative element to Van Buren,\" he said. \"He exhausts himself because he's trying to dominate, to be the one in charge, be Mr. Charming. I don't think he can ever enter a room without being self-conscious. That's an exhausting way to be, I reckon.\"",
      "Born in England, Pearce moved to Australia and at age 20 starred in the popular soap opera \"Neighbours.\" He shot to international fame starring in \"L.A. Confidential\" and Christopher Nolan's \"Memento.\"\u00a0 And while he appeared in the best picture winners \"The King's Speech\" and \"The Hurt Locker,\" and the \"Alien\" franchise, much of his resume has been in smaller films, such as \"Animal Kingdom,\" \"The Rover,\" and \"Factory Girl\" (playing Andy Warhol). He won an Emmy for the HBO mini-series \"Mildred Pierce.\"",

      "Set in 1970s and '80s New York City, the film (written by journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Ali Abbasi) traces the origins of the real estate tycoon and future reality TV star/U.S. president through his relationship with Cohn, who, it could be said, helped make Trump what he is today.",

    "story": [
      "Two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman, 95, and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog were found dead Wednesday afternoon in their home outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The deaths were found to be \"suspicious enough in nature\" to require a thorough investigation, a search warrant filed in New Mexico says.",
      "In an email to CBS News early Thursday, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office said, \"Foul play is not suspected as a factor in those deaths at this time. However, (the) exact cause of death has not been determined.\"",
      "\"This is an active and ongoing investigation by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office,\" the statement added.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa had been dead for some time and their bodies were found by deputies in different rooms, according to a search warrant obtained by CBS News. Hackman was found in a mudroom and Arakawa was found in a bathroom next to a space heater, and there was an open prescription bottle and pills on the counter near Arakawa, the warrant said.",
      "Hackman's daughters and granddaughter released a statement Thursday confirming the deaths.",
      "\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,\" Elizabeth, Annie and Leslie Hackman said in the statement. \"We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.\"",
      "Hackman was a consummate actor renowned for playing complicated figures in such classics as \"The French Connection,\" \"The Conversation\" and \"Unforgiven,\" and who also delighted superhero fans as the comical villain Lex Luthor in three \"Superman\" films.",
      "Hailed as one of the best actors of the era before retiring from the screen in 2004, Hackman moved easily among genres, from heart-wrenching family stories (\"I Never Sang for My Father\"), crime dramas (\"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Mississippi Burning\"), thrillers (\"The Conversation,\" \"No Way Out\"), and triumphant tales of sports (\"Hoosiers\") to comedies (\"Get Shorty,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums\").",
      "Rough-hewn and flinty, a movie star without stereotypical movie-star looks, Hackman gave even his humorous roles a slightly sinister, unpredictable edge.",
      "The quality of Hackman's performances and the charisma that the shy ex-Marine would bring to the screen were praised by famed stage director Ulu Grosbard, who'd once hired him for a small role in Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge.\" In a 2004 Vanity Fair profile, Grosbard described the actor as \"a complex guy. Very intelligent. A generosity of spirit. Socially charming. A lot going on in him. A certain sense of being tormented with past ghosts and things. That's part of what he brings to his work.\"",
      "\"Ghosts and things\" were likely evoked in three of Hackman's most heralded performances, in movies that redefined their genres. In William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\" (1971), Hackman played \"Popeye\" Doyle, a New York City detective unbound by rules, who constantly crossed the line between law officer and law breaker while tracking down the head of a drug ring. Dangerous and unpredictable, his Doyle was brash, vindictive and colorful, whether it was chasing down a suspect while wearing a Santa Claus costume or recklessly driving a car in pursuit of an assassin through the streets of Brooklyn.",
      "In Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" (1974), he starred as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert whose wiretapping of his subjects leads to increased paranoia about his own safety when he believes he's uncovered evidence of a murder plot; and in Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western \"Unforgiven\" (1992), Hackman played \"Little\" Bill Daggett, the brutal sheriff of a Wyoming town who confronts Eastwood's bounty-hunting gunslinger.",
      "\"There was no finer actor than Gene,\" Eastwood said in a statement following Hackman's death. \"Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.\"",
      "In a 2001 New York Times interview, Hackman noted that his scene in which he brutally beats up a bounty hunter played by Richard Harris was fueled by the disappointment that Harris hadn't remembered working with Hackman on the 1966 film \"Hawaii.\"",
      "\"I just took that disappointment and did this kind of transference,\" Hackman said.",
      "Hackman was less \"method-y\" than some of his peers, though he admitted that the ways in which he would behave on-screen and off as he inhabited a character \u2014 fueled by memories of his dysfunctional family growing up and the slights he faced during his struggling early years \u2014 took their toll. Temper tantrums earned him a nickname: \"Vesuvius.\"",
      "''I don't mean to live my roles,'' he told The Times. ''But sometimes I suppose it's not comfortable to be around me.''",
      "His success as an actor was merely one facet of Hackman's biography. He also raced sports cars, flew planes, deep-sea dived, painted, designed houses, and wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels \u2014 living a life as varied and challenging as the roles for which he became famous. \"I need the diversity,\" he explained to CBS's \"Sunday Morning\" in 2000.",
      "\"One could say, you know, that I've achieved some manner of success,\" Hackman said. \"But it's like the difference between being a doctor and a lawyer, and being, maybe, a laborer. I feel that, in some ways, my efforts of being an actor are so all-instinctive, and that I haven't really paid my dues in terms of my contribution to the firmament.\"",
      "From character actor to star",
      "A shy and itinerant acting student, Hackman washed out of classes at the Pasadena Playhouse with the worst grades ever. He had several TV credits (including \"Naked City,\" \"The Defenders\" and \"Route 66\") and was featured in several light comedies on Broadway before appearing in the 1964 Warren Beatty film \"Lilith.\" After Hackman co-starred in \"Hawaii,\" \"A Covenant of Death\" and the war film \"First to Fight,\" Beatty hired him to play Buck Barrow, the older brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow, in the 1967 classic \"Bonnie and Clyde.\"",
      "The film, directed by Arthur Penn and produced by Beatty, was a shot across the bow of the studio system in its glamorous and violent dramatization of a pair of Depression Era lovers who robbed banks and killed people. After initially receiving lukewarm reviews over its blend of blood and sardonic humor, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" quickly garnered a reappraisal, spearheading Hollywood's own \"New Wave\" of filmmaking that revolutionized the industry in the late 1960s and '70s.",
      "It earned 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Hackman for best supporting actor.",
      "His film resume grew as a result, to include \"Riot,\" \"The Gypsy Moths,\" \"Downhill Racer,\" \"Marooned,\" and \"I Never Sang for My Father,\" earning Hackman his second Oscar nod for supporting actor, playing the son of a dominating parent (Melvyn Douglas).",
      "\"The French Connection\" would cement Hackman's position as a movie star. The film's brash, documentary-style production perfectly captured Hackman's character, a seething, sadistic NYC cop seeking to bust a ring of heroin smugglers \u2014 like Ahab on the hunt for the white whale.",
      "Although much of the film's heralded chase scene \u2014 in which Doyle, in a car, pursues an assassin who has hijacked an above-ground subway train \u2014\u00a0 featured stunt driver Bill Hickman, Hackman as Doyle did drive for some of it, crashing his car into a wall.",
      "At times during production, Hackman was unsure about his performance and asked to be fired. And then, after the film proved to be a hit, winning five Oscars \u2014 including for best picture, best director and best actor \u2014 he feared that he would be typecast as a determined cop thereafter. Hackman would return to the role in the 1975 sequel, \"French Connection II,\" in which he gave a grueling portrayal of Doyle suffering withdrawal from heroin addiction.",
      "His star power led him to both big-budget studio fare, headlining an all-star cast in the 1972 disaster film \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" and small character dramas such as \"Scarecrow,\" opposite Al Pacino, and \"Zandy's Bride,\" co-starring Liv Ullman. Other 1970s appearances included playing a private eye in the film noir \"Night Moves\"; a horseman competing in a cross-country race in the Western \"Bite the Bullet\"; a rum-runner in the Prohibition Era comedy \"Lucky Lady\" (opposite Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli); a contract killer in the conspiracy thriller \"The Domino Principle\"; and a World War II general in \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "One of his most memorable turns was an unbilled cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein,\" playing a blind hermit who spills hot soup into the lap of Peter Boyle's monster.",
      "Then came \"Superman\" (1978), in which Hackman, as Lex Luthor, faced off against Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel in a scheme that involved nuking the San Andreas Fault, which would make much of California slide into the ocean and turn Luthor's worthless desert land into prime seaside real estate.",
      "Hackman's criminal mastermind was wily, vain, cantankerous, and a bit too sure of himself. He told the BBC in 1986 that playing Luthor was great fun: \"He's kind of a flamboyant character and deranged, and all the things that actors love to play.\"",
      "Still, director Richard Donner had to go to lengths to coax Hackman into taking the job (a $2 million paycheck helped), and when the actor refused to shave off his mustache (let alone shave his head), Donner agreed to shave off his own mustache if Hackman got rid of his. Once the actor put a razor to his upper lip, Donner ripped off his own mustache \u2014\u00a0 a fake.",
      "He continued playing Luthor for the sequel (shot concurrently with the first film), but when Donner was fired by the producers and replaced for the remainder of what would be released as \"Superman II,\" Hackman walked. A body double and dubbed voice filled in for him. He later returned to the role in 1987's \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\"",
      "\"Getting to be somebody\"",
      "Eugene Alden Hackman was born January 30, 1930 in San Bernadino, California. His father, a pressman for newspapers, moved the family several times during Hackman's youth before they settled in Danville, Illinois. It was there, when Gene was 13, that his father left the family with just a wave goodbye.",
      "Seeking escape from an uneasy family life, Gene was entranced by the movies. He idolized James Cagney and Errol Flynn, and vowed to become an actor himself. \"I loved the idea that somebody could convince me that they were a sea captain without being phony,\" he told Vanity Fair in 2004. \"I think because I was shy I felt insecure, and acting seemed like a way of maybe getting around that. Getting to be somebody.\"",
      "He dropped out of school and lied about his age to get into the Marine Corps, where he spent four and a half years. He got a taste of performing as an announcer on Armed Forces Radio, but injuries from a motorcycle accident led to his departure from the Marines, just in time to avoid fighting in the Korean War.",
      "He tried his hand at acting with classes at the Pasadena Playhouse, where his fellow students voted him (along with classmate Dustin Hoffman) \"Least Likely to Succeed.\" He picked up and moved to New York City, where he existed in a stream of menial jobs as he tried to create a path toward an acting career, aided and abetted by a circle that included Hoffman and Robert Duvall. Married, Hackman even shared his apartment with Hoffman for a time, as they experienced disappointments that would have crushed others.",
      "\"It was more psychological warfare, because I wasn't going to let those f*****s get me down,\" Hackman told Vanity Fair. \"I insisted with myself that I would continue to do whatever it took to get a job. It was like me against them, and in some way, unfortunately, I still feel that way. But I think if you're really interested in acting there is a part of you that relishes the struggle. It's a narcotic in the way that you are trained to do this work and nobody will let you do it, so you're a little bit nuts. You lie to people, you cheat, you do whatever it takes to get an audition, get a job.\"",
      "The rejections, he said, \"create a resolve in you that, no matter what kind of part you're given, you can do anything. Give me the challenge, I can do it. The scarier the better.\"",
      "\"He is incapable of bad work\"",
      "In the 1980s, his marriage with Faye Maltese, with whom he'd had three children, ended in divorce. Uncomfortable with life in Los Angeles, he contemplated retirement, though his desire for acting continued.",
      "His credits included \"All Night Long,\" \"Reds,\" \"Under Fire,\" \"Uncommon Valor,\" \"Twice in a Lifetime\" (a rare romantic role), \"Power,\" \"Hoosiers,\" \"No Way Out,\" \"Split Decisions,\" \"Bat*21,\" \"Another Woman,\" \"Postcards From the Edge,\" \"Narrow Margin\" and \"Class Action.\"",
      "In 1988's \"Mississippi Burning,\" Hackman's FBI agent scrapes against the by-the-book attitude of his colleague (played by Willem Dafoe) as they investigate the kidnapping and death of civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi. Hackman earned his fourth Oscar nomination for his performance.",
      "Alan Parker, the film's director, said of Hackman, \"He is incapable of bad work. Every director has a short list of actors he'd die to work with, and I'll bet Gene's on every one.\"",
      "The '90s gave him further latitude to explore his considerable range, from John Grisham legal thrillers (\"The Firm,\" \"The Chamber,\" \"Runaway Jury\") to westerns (\"Unforgiven,\" \"Geronimo: An American Legend,\" \"The Quick and the Dead,\" \"Wyatt Earp\"). He brought heft and authority to the thrillers \"Crimson Tide,\" \"Extreme Measures,\" \"Absolute Power,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Under Suspicion,\" \"Heist,\" and \"Behind Enemy Lines,\" and winking humanity to the comedies \"The Birdcage,\" \"Heartbreakers,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" and \"Welcome to Mooseport,\" his last film appearance.",
      "In 1992, he starred on Broadway in \"Death and the Maiden\" with Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfuss, under the direction of Mike Nichols.",
      "Hackman the writer",
      "He retired from the screen in 2004 and would only return as narrator on a pair of documentaries about the Marines. He lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his second wife, Betsy Arakawa, and pursued his interests in art and writing.",
      "When he met up with Daniel Lenihan for some scuba lessons, the two got to talking about adventure books they grew up with and decided to try writing one \u2014 a pirate story. Hackman wrote his chapters longhand in spiral notebooks; the two would then meet up at a caf\u00e9 to go over their work. \"I would have some pages, he would have some pages,\" Hackman told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"We would trade. And we'd read them over while we were ordering and eating, and by the end of that couple of hours, we would have critiqued each other's work and decided where we were going to go from there.\"",
      "\"The Wake of the Perdido Star,\" a tale of shipwrecks and piracy set in 1805, was published in 1999. It sold well but received mixed reviews. The acclaimed actor now faced a new audience. He told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The fact that you're being judged on your intelligence and your skill as a writer, and your skill as a storyteller, that was very tense for me \u2014 and being criticized, and finding that you're vulnerable to the critics, in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\"",
      "Hackman and Lenihan later collaborated on the crime drama \"Justice for None\" (2004) and the historical novel \"Escape From Andersonville\" (2008). Hackman then authored two books solo: a Western, \"Payback at Morning Peak,\" and a police thriller, \"Pursuit.\"",

      "\"It was hard,\" he admitted. \"And we wanted to kill each other at the end of it. It's like learnin' how to play. It's hard. But that's what makes it worth doin'.\"",

Like, you have the wisest, most insightful people in the world are talkin' to you,'\" Marsalis recalled when he began his classical training.",

      "\"Wicked,\" the film version of the long-running Broadway musical (which was itself based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel), is a prequel to \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and tells of the friendship and falling-out between Glinda (the most popular student at Shiz University) and Elphaba (an outcast who would go on to become the Wicked Witch of the West).",
      "This tale of frenemies is anchored by best actress Oscar nominee Cynthia Erivo, whose performance echoes the pain of being seen as different (she was born green) and of being targeted by an authoritarian power (which she has dared to stand up to), resulting in her using her new-found power to thwart capture.",
      "In this scene, having decided that she must leave the Emerald City as the nefarious forces of the Wizard close in on her, Elphaba parts ways with Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande), and expresses her wish for freedom, with the song \"Defying Gravity\":",
      "Asked what she brought to the role of Elphaba, Erivo told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The vulnerability, her humanity.\" She described that vulnerability for herself, personally, as \"always wanting to do well and not wanting to fail, not wanting to let family down. Those are the insecurities. Finally owning how I look.\"",
      "What do you mean?\u00a0 \"Well, I think we're not necessarily told that, you know, dark-skinned Black girls are the prettiest girls,\" Erivo said. \"And the only person that really is telling you, thankfully, is your mother. It's up to you to figure out that for yourself, and to start owning what beauty is to you.\"",
      "Erivo, who won a Tony Award, a Grammy and an Emmy for her role as Celie in the 2015 Broadway revival of \"The Color Purple,\" was previously nominated for two Academy Awards, for best actress and best original song, for the 2019 drama \"Harriet,\" about abolitionist Harriet Tubman.",
      "Erivo's performance as Elphaba is notable not just for her singing, which is astounding, but for singing live on set, rather than acting to pre-recorded vocal tracks. She said it allowed her to play, and change her performance, moment to moment: \"It means that you can act on impulse. \u2026 You have more breath, more space.\"",
      "She told \"CBS Mornings\" that she did change the character slightly from the original Broadway show (which was originated by Tony-winner Idina Menzel), in order to inform Elphaba with her own experience. \"I definitely felt like I had a responsibility to the character and to the piece because I didn't want to remove it so far away that you just didn't recognize her anymore,\" she said, \"but I also wanted to find out what the truth was for me playing this character. So, I knew it would feel different, but I wasn't trying to make it different. I just knew that if I told my truth, it would end up being different anyway. There's no need to force the difference in.

A fake death is staged, Manitas' wife and children are relocated to Europe, and Manitas becomes Emilia P\u00e9rez.",

      "In May, Gasc\u00f3n told the Associated Press, \"I want to get to the point where trans actresses are not limited to only playing trans characters. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you can't also play a lady going to the bakery. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you can't play a philosopher. Trans people are normal and ordinary just like anyone else. Not every trans person is engaged in prostitution on the street and if they do pursue it's because society rejects them, not necessarily because they wanted to do it. So, the opportunity for me to play these two roles is a gift from the universe. \u2026 It's marvelous to be able to find myself with roles like these.\"",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's Oscar nomination was announced (she was also nominated for a BAFTA, Golden Globe, C\u00e9sar, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards), she received backlash over a series of offensive and racist social media posts she'd made several years earlier. In one, from 2021, she slammed the Academy Awards ceremony as something akin to \"an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or [International Women's Day].\" Other posts attacked Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, and George Floyd.",

But she was dropped from Netflix's promotional tour for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" was absent from Spain's Goya Awards\u00a0and Britain's BAFTAs, and had a book cancelled. The film's director disavowed her, telling Deadline, \"I haven't spoken to her, and I don't want to.\"",
      "On February 9, at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Selena Gomez commented on the controversy swirling around \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and Gasc\u00f3n's posts: \"Some of the magic has disappeared, but I choose to continue to be proud of what I've done, and I'm just grateful.

      "Sean Baker's \"Anora,\" which won the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival, is a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of a Brooklyn sex worker who enters into a Cinderella romance and marriage with the flighty son of Russian oligarchs. Mikey Madison portrays Anora (preferred name: Ani) as a woman older than her 25 years, but still young enough to believe in the sanctity of elopement, when she and her immature lover, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), decide to tie the knot in Las Vegas.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2013 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "In this scene, Ivan makes his proposal, to a young woman not quite sure whether to believe the guy (Note: Graphic language):",
      "Madison told Variety that it was a long, engaged process for her to get into the world Ani inhabited: \"It was a character that felt so far away from home in every single way. It was very intimidating at first; how do I empathize with her? I was like, I just need to start small. I did quite a bit of pole training. I did this stripper boot camp where I was taught how to give lap dances, how to twerk. And I would know everything about her \u2014 what cigarettes she smokes, what her school life was like.\"",
      "Madison, whose credits include Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\" \"Scream,\" and the TV series \"Better Things,\" told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Baker, whose past films include \"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine\" and \"Prince of Broadway,\" told Madison he would write the character of Ani expressly for her if she agreed to be in his movie. \"It's very surreal, and I am very lucky, because I dreamed of working with someone like Sean my entire career as an actress,\" she said.",
      "Madison's accent in particular was key to her getting the character. She moved into the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn a month before shooting, in order to absorb the sound of the locals. Luna Sof\u00eda Miranda, who plays Ani's best friend, Lulu, and who is herself a stripper, also instructed Madison on the vernacular of the world of \"gentlemen's clubs.\" \"She is amazing and was so sweet, and made me [two] PowerPoint presentations,\" Madison said. \"One of them was just stripper memes, and then another one was lingo and slang.\"",
      "What was some of the slang? \"Brick.\u00a0Oh, it's brick outside, which means it's cold. And then another one, I think, was a whale, which means a very wealthy, powerful person who comes into the club, someone who has a lot of money.\"",
      "Madison told the Hollywood Reporter that one of the lessons she learned from Baker was, \"He really made it clear that he cared about my ideas and what I was bringing to the film. The most important thing I learned from him is that my opinion and my voice matter.\"",
      "She returned to Brighton Beach since the film was released and found everything to be exactly the same. \"That's one of the things I love about Brighton Beach, is that it's such a time capsule. It's basically been the same for 30 years,\" she told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "This is Madison's first Academy Award nomination. She won the BAFTA, was nominated for Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards, and received best actress honors from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (tying with Marianne Jean-Baptiste for \"Hard Truths\").",

      "In the darkly comic body horror film \"The Substance,\" Demi Moore plays an aging TV star who discovers a sinister-looking potion that can give her a younger, more perfect version of herself, but at a terrible price.",
      "Moore, who has been a Hollywood fixture \u2013 and a target of the tabloid press \u2013 since the 1980s, told \"Sunday Morning\" that she recognized the story's message about the pains those in the public eye would go through to meet supposed social standards. \"I put so much pressure on myself,\" she said, when discussing the value she had placed on her attractiveness in the past. \"And I did have experiences of being told to lose weight. And all of those, while they may have been embarrassing and humiliating, it's what I did to myself because of that.\"",
      "In this scene, Moore's character, preparing for a date, looks in the mirror, applies makeup, then purposely smears it. She said the process of shooting that scene was difficult. \"Emotionally, that idea that I think many of us have been where we're trying to make something better, and then we just keep making it worse,\" she said. \"For me, it's one of the most heart-wrenching moments in the whole film. And it was at least 15 takes each time. And so, by the end, my face was raw.\"",
      "Asked what she thinks when she looks in a mirror, Moore replied, \"Uhm, it fluctuates. Some days I look and I'm like, Wow. That's pretty good. \u00a0And some days, I catch myself dissecting, hyper-focusing on, you know, things that I don't like.",
      "\"The difference is, now I can catch myself. I can go, Yeah, I don't like that loose skin. But, you know, it is what it is. So, I'm gonna make the best of what is, as opposed to chasing what isn't.\"",
      "Moore endured hours of body prosthetics, and spent much time naked on-screen. She told \"CBS Mornings,\" \"The interesting thing for me was the exploration of that violence we have against ourselves, the harshness of how we can sit in judgment \u2013 that heavily comparing and dissecting. That for me was something that really resonated, because I felt that was so human.\"",
      "She broke out in such films as \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"No Small Affair,\" and starred in \"The Seventh Sign,\" \"Ghost,\" \"A Few Good Men,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Striptease,\" \"G.I. Jane,\" and \"Margin Call.\"\u00a0 \"The Substance,\" which marks her first Oscar nomination, won Moore a Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (musical or comedy) and the Screen Actors Guild Award.",
      "\"Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress,\" she said, accepting her Golden Globe. \"And at that time, I made that mean that this wasn't something that I was allowed to have. And so today, I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me. And for the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong.\"",

In 1971 Rubens was kidnapped by the military, tortured and killed.",
      "The film, directed by Walter Salles (\"Central Station,\" \"The Motorcycle Diaries\"), is based on the 2015 book \"I'm Still Here,\" written by Marcelo Rubens Palva, about his parents. \"[The book is] when we really discovered Eunice,\" Torres told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \"The book is about the son in his adulthood discovering that the real hero of the family was not the father, not him, but it was this amazing woman called Eunice Paiva.\"",
      "It was a story almost lost to history. Following her husband's murder, Eunice \u2013 a housewife and mother of five \u2013 not only fights to protect her children, but also fights to confront a repressive system. She returned to university and became a lawyer, and eventually led efforts to protect the rights of Indigenous people in Brazil and for protection of the Amazon rain forest. But her contributions were never fully acknowledged by the public.",
      "\"It's like a woman who always fights the right fight, and she never had the will to be recognized by this, which is kind of strange nowadays,\" Torres said. \"She was a woman who never felt like it was important for [herself] to be recognized.\"",
      "In this scene, Eunice \u2013 alerted to the death of the family dog in front of their home \u2013 confronts two mysterious men parked across the street, who have been spying on her:",

The first? Her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, nominated for \"Central Station.\"",
      "Torres told W Magazine, \"I was raised in the wings of theaters. My father, Fernando, is also an actor and producer. And they named me Fernanda. So, I couldn't escape, you see? I paid a lot of hours in shrinks, and I really don't know how I did it, but I did it. I started working as an actress from the time I was 13 years old. \u2026 I find it a miracle. Isn't it a miracle? Even now, to be here with this film. The other day, I saw Judi Dench saying that there is a lot of luck involved in this business, and I think she's right.\"",
      "\"My mother reminded me a lot of Eunice \u2013 the intelligence, a kind of woman that is down-to-earth and courageous,\"\u00a0she told Interview Magazine. \"It's a form of femininity. It has so much to do with my childhood that I think it became universal because of that.",
      "\"It's a tragic story,\" she said. \"In tragedy, you face the unfaceable. You restrain, and you endure. That was very clear, and I never worked in anything like that, where I have restraint and change through the restraint. She was just like a sketch of what she could be, and after the disappearance of the man, she becomes herself, which is a beautiful tale.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here\" has become a sensation in Brazil, where the nation's collective memory about the hundreds who disappeared under the dictatorship, and the 20,000 estimated to have been tortured under military rule across two decades, is being revived through the story of Eunice and her family. But the film also met with universal acclaim outside of Brazil, and earned Torres the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (drama).",
      "Commenting on the packed category of actresses, Torres talked with \"Entertainment Tonight\" about her \"Cinderella night,\" at the Golden Globes, saying, \"Everybody deserves it. Everybody. So I don't know why they choose this street dog that speaks Portuguese, but I'm so glad!\"",
      "Like Gascon, Torres has been made to address her past, in her case a performance from 2008 in the Brazilian sketch comedy series \"Fantastico,\" in which she appeared in blackface. She told Deadline, \"At that time, despite the efforts of Black movements and organizations, the awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn't yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil. Thanks to better cultural understanding and important but incomplete achievements in this century, it's very clear now in our country and everywhere that blackface is never acceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here,\" released by Sony Pictures Classics, is also nominated for best picture and best international feature film.  It is screening exclusively in theaters.",

      "Michelle Trachtenberg, star of the teen drama series \"Gossip Girl\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" has died at 39 years old, the New York Police Department confirmed to CBS News on Wednesday. She was found at her home in Manhattan, and the death is not believed to be suspicious, police said.",
      "The NYPD said officers responded to a 911 call at 8:01 a.m. local time Wednesday to an apartment in midtown Manhattan, where they found the actress unconscious and unresponsive.",

      "Through her representative, Trachtenberg's family confirmed the actress' death and requested privacy for their loss.",

      "Trachtenberg, a child actor who grew up in Brooklyn, appeared in her first commercials at age 3, according to the\u00a0movie database\u00a0IMDb. At 8 years old, she landed a role as Nona Mecklenberg on Nickelodeon's \"The Adventures of Pete & Pete,\" which ran from 1994 to 1996.",
      "She starred in \"Harriet the Spy\" and other movies, and landed the plum role of Buffy's younger sister, Dawn, in the hit series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" in 2000. She wasn't yet 18 years old.",

      "Adrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"",
      "In 2003 Adrien Brody became the youngest best actor Oscar-winner in history for his performance in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a musician struggling to survive in the Jewish ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It was a role for which he virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning the piano so that he could play Chopin.",
      "Twenty-two years later, Brody is back with his second Oscar nomination for \"The Brutalist,\" Brady Corbet's lacerating tale of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States, and his efforts both to resume his career and to assimilate in a society where antisemitism and classism are rife.",
      "T\u00f3th  is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. In this scene, T\u00f3th  \u2013 who is working a construction site in Pennsylvania \u2013 is discovered by Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce), who sees in T\u00f3th a talent for which he wants to be the patron.",
      "T\u00f3th  accepts a commission. But once his wife Erzs\u00e9bet (best supporting actress nominee Felicity Jones) arrives from Europe, T\u00f3th\u00a0 feels caught between his artistic impulses and the realities of working in an America that, in many cases, is closed to the foreign born:",
      "Brody, whose mother and grandparents fled Hungary during the 1956 revolution, said their sacrifices informed his performance. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "He also heard the voice of his Hungarian grandfather in T\u00f3th. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said. \"I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "In this extended interview with \"Sunday Morning,\" Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the Golden Globe for best motion picture actor (drama), and the BAFTA for \"The Brutalist.\" The film received 10 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director (Brady Corbet).",
      "\"The Brutalist,\"\u00a0released by A24, is playing in select theaters in\u00a070mm, and is available via VOD.",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"A Complete Unknown\"",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned his first best actor Oscar nomination at age 22 for \"Call Me By Your Name,\" as a teenage boy who becomes the target of an older man. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet plays the iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan during the years when he made a name for himself as a folk artist and as a rock star who, to a segment of his fans, left the roots of folk music behind.",
      "In this scene Dylan is introduced by Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton) for his first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he performs \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Prior to shooting, Chalamet travelled to Minnesota to research Dylan's roots and his formative days. He returned to the state for a screening of the finished film in Minneapolis. In December\u00a0Chalamet told CBS Minnesota station WCCO, \"I think he's very proud of his Minnesota heritage, and I think, in some ways, the way I relate to him is, I think the iron ore in his songs and the iron ore in his voice \u2014 as a New Yorker, as a 28-year-old New Yorker, I don't think my path would have really brought me out here, ever.",
      "\"So, the first time I got here I thought, 'Wow, what a gift, Bob Dylan, being in this guy's worldview.'\"",
      "The actor was first attached to the project in 2019, but shooting was repeatedly delayed due to COVID and then the actors' strike. In the intervening years, Chalamet learned how to play the guitar. \"I don't know if I'll ever get this much time to work on something in advance,\"\u00a0he told The Hollywood Reporter. He also gained 20 pounds prior to shooting, to better match the folk singer's physique.",
      "He said the role marked the furthest that he'd stretched himself. \"And it became so biblical to me in terms of this man's life and his work that I felt if I let my focus err for a second, that I'd be self-loathing about it for years to come. I had three months to play Bob Dylan, and the rest of my life I don't get to be about that, so why not give it my all?\"",
      "To connect with what the reclusive Dylan represented, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he disconnected from his own life for the two-and-a-half months of filming. He did not use his cellphone, or have visitors on set. \"I've never approached a character so intensely as Bob, 'cause I have such respect for the material,\" Chalamet said. \"And I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I remembered that I was lazy on a day when something went wrong.\"",
      "In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he learned to perform about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script. But while Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie (to be played back on set during filming), he said they sounded \"too clean,\" and so he tried performing live on set, doing so the first time in a scene in which Dylan visits his terminally ill hero, folk artist Woody Guthrie, in a New Jersey hospital.",
      "Director James Mangold said he knew Chalamet nailed \"Song to Woody\" on his first take: \"There's a moment in that scene right at the last stanza where he holds a note \u2013 that would never have happened if we'd used the playback track,\" Mangold said.",
      "Chalamet also examined video of the singer, including footage taken of a Dylan performing a duet of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" with Joan Baez, which he played at a reduced speed. \"That was when I really slowed down, 'cause it's fascinating the way Bob observes her,\" he said. \"And how he refuses eye contact in that video.\"",
      "In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet and Barbaro perform \"It Ain't Me Babe\":",
      "Speaking of the finished film, Chalamet said, \"I was honored and counting my lucky stars that we got to bring this to life. Because nothing's a given. No opportunity is a given. No career is a given. I talked a lot about this with Edward Norton: the gift to work on something where every day \u2014 whether listening to the musicians we were playing, or the musicians that inspired them, or reading the authors that inspired them \u2014 you learn more about yourself.\"",
      "Chalamet told \"60 Minutes\" he's not sure what he'd say to Dylan if he ever did meet him \u2013 but maybe not even mention the movie, and only talk about the weather: \"What his favorite sandwich is, or something like that ... I would play it super cool, you know? 'Cause I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise.\"",
      "Chalamet won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.",

      "At New York's Sing Sing prison, the organization Rehabilitation Through the Arts, or RTA, was formed to produce plays featuring incarcerated men performing classics by Shakespeare, as well as original plays that spoke to the lived experiences of men. \u00a0The value of theater as a tool of reform was made palpable by RTA's success; compared to the prison's typical recidivism rate of 60%, only 3% of former inmates who had taken part in RTA were back in prison three years or less after their release.",
      "Directed by Greg Kwedar, the film \"Sing Sing\" was built on the experiences of real-life former inmates (two of whom, Clarence Maclin and John Divine G Whitfield, share an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay). Colman Domingo was nominated for playing Divine G, a founding member of Sing Sing's theater program and an award-winning author.",
      "In this scene, Divine G attends a clemency hearing and describes to the commissioners how the prison program grew into something he calls \"wonderful\":",
      "Domingo was a journeyman actor whose work in recent years has exploded, from \"Fear the Walking Dead\" and \"Euphoria,\" to \"The Color Purple\" and \"The Madness.\" He received two Tony Award nominations (for acting in the musical \"The Scottsboro Boys\" and producing the play \"Fat Ham\"). He earned his first Oscar nomination last year for playing civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in \"Rustin.\"",
      "He talked about his recent success on \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0last November: \"I feel that it's been a long time in my journey, where suddenly the roles are sort of meeting my skill set and what I'm curious about and what I can do. So, it just feels like I'm a journeyman actor. I've been working for 34 years, and it just feels like, I never knew what this time would be like.\"",
      "Last March, on the day of the Oscars, Domingo posted a picture of himself on Instagram as a child, writing, \"His dream came true. Not easily. With dedication, hard work, hardships, triumphs, pitfalls, detours, reroutes and love and faith. Today is a good day for this kid. He already won. And as you can tell he always loved a pop of color. Got it from his parents.\"",
      "That \"pop of color\" led to Domingo being asked by Anna Wintour to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala. \"She actually said, 'I'm not sure if you'd be interested in something like this or if you have time,'\" Domingo laughed. \"I said, 'I think I have time!'\"",

As Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, Fiennes navigates the intrigue of papal politics, a reluctant player consumed with doubt.",
      "In this scene, Lawrence gives a sermon about the power of uncertainty in faith.",
      "\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.",

      "In \"The Apprentice,\" set in 1970s and '80s New York City, a young Donald Trump, trying to take charge of his father's real estate business, comes under the tutelage of Roy Cohn, a notorious attorney-fixer, who instructs Trump on how to promote himself in the media. Cohn's dictum:\u00a0 Attack, attack, attack. Deny, deny, deny. Never admit defeat \u2026 lessons that Trump would carry through in his business career, social media projections and, later, political branding.",
      "In this scene, Trump (best actor nominee Sebastian Stan) tries to sell himself to a newspaper reporter, using the motivation of Cohn (best supporting actor nominee Jeremy Strong) to not-quite-successful effect. It's clear he has a ways to go\u2026",
      "The film, written by journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Ali Abbasi, premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival. While it received critical praise, potential film distributors shied away after the Trump campaign threatened to sue.

      "In an appearance last October on \"CBS Mornings,\" Stan (whose credits include \"Gossip Girl,\" \"I, Tonya,\" \"Pam & Tommy,\" and playing Bucky Barnes in Marvel's Captain America franchise), admitted that he'd been warned by some to stay away from the project, specifically because it could be seen as a political third rail.",
      "\"Yeah, it's usually when I hear 'Don't do it,' I end up doing it!\" he laughed. \"But generally speaking, I think fear should motivate us to go into the storm, not run away from it.",
      "\"People are going to come into the film with a lot of baggage, a lot of projections [about Trump],\" he said. \"But I think trying to strip away all the noise and getting down to the basics \u2014 what is the emotional need? What is the drive? What was the potential of the man, and where did it end up? How did it all get to this today? And I think there's still value in understanding that.",
      "\"I think the film's about trust,\" said Stan. \"I think we have an opportunity to look at these people and genuinely ask ourselves, do we trust them? Can we use our human instinct rather than what we're being told to think, feel, and understand? Can we use our instinct to trust these people as we're going forward into the future?\"",

    "summary": "Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud in a plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property.",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal charge accusing her of concocting a brazen plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property before a judge halted the mysterious foreclosure sale.",
      "During a hearing in front of a Memphis federal judge, Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She previously pleaded not guilty to the two-count indictment, which also includes a count of aggravated identity theft that will now be dropped.",
      "When asked by the judge if Findley was admitting guilt and accepting responsibility, she said \"Yes.\" Findley will be sentenced on June 19. She would have faced up to 20 years if convicted, but she is expected to receive less than that under the plea deal.",
      "\"We are grateful for the hard work of the federal investigators and prosecutors who secured this conviction,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. \"Graceland matters so much to so many people around the world \u2013 just go to Memphis during Elvis Week and listen to all the different accents and languages of fans who make the pilgrimage. All of Tennessee is glad that Graceland remains safely in the possession of Elvis's heir and that it will remain a celebrated Memphis landmark for generations to come.\"",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan\u00a0before her death in January 2023, prosecutors alleged when she was\u00a0charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents, and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "In May, a public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owes $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.",
      "Keough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending \u2014 the bogus lender authorities say Findley created \u2014 said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough's lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.",
      "Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate's lawsuit. The judge said the notary's affidavit brings into question \"the authenticity of the signature.\"",
      "The judge halted the foreclosure sale of the beloved Memphis tourist attraction, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing that a company's attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.",
      "Elvis bought Graceland in 1957 and died there in 1977, and about five years later, the mansion was opened to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the 17,552-square-foot mansion each year, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Visitors can then stop at the large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street.",
      "Elvis and other members of the Presley family, including Lisa Marie Presley and her son, Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide in 2020, are buried on the mansion's grounds.",
      "Keough, who starred in the television series hit \"Daisy Jones and The Six,\" said in a 2024 interview\u00a0with CBS News that she plans to continue running the beloved property and keep the mansion in the family. Keough and her husband Ben Smith-Peterson have a\u00a0daughter, Tupelo,\u00a0who is Elvis' first great-grandchild.",
      "\"I think, like, my instinct with everything is always to do what my mother would have wanted. Which is to keep it a home,\" Keough told CBS News last year. \"It was our family's home.\"",

After years of reflection and now thoughtful, the new team and I have amazing plans for Fyre 2. The adventure seekers who trust the vision and take the leap will help make history.\"",
      "For now, it's unclear what exactly festival attendees are getting for their money. The festival's site promises arts, cuisine, music, comedy, fashion, gaming, sports and \"treasures.\" But no musical artists have committed to performing at the three-day event, slated for May 30 to June 2. Instead, so-called \"Fyre Experiences\" will be released in a number of drops leading up to the festival,\" its website says.",
      "Lostnights, a Mexican festival producer, will produce and operate the event.",

      "A package valued at roughly $1.1 million, dubbed the \"Prometheus God of Fyre\" pass, covers accommodations for up to eight people, although other perks are not specified.

      "McFarland also promised a luxury experience at the first Fyre fest, staged in Great Exuma, Bahamas, eight years ago, with Blink-182 and other musical acts expected to perform.",

      "McFarland, who was convicted of defrauding investors of more than $27 million, in 2018 was sentenced to six years in prison. He served four years and was released in 2022.

What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",
      "Offit said he received the notification that the meeting was canceled shortly after 4 p.m. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to discuss how to update the shots for the next flu season, Offit said.",
      "Some of the other committee members said they had not received any notification about the upcoming meeting being canceled. Offit said the email he received was addressed to all of the committee's members.",

      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "\"Because the vaccine is grown in eggs, for the most part, it requires six months to produce. So March is six months before September, which is when these vaccines roll out,\" said Offit.",

      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",

    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month.

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 14:05:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers still coping with high food costs face scalding hot coffee prices, with retail costs up 75% in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregorys Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, who has been tasked with leading the\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, is pleading for retired air traffic controllers to consider returning to work amid an ongoing, nationwide shortage of qualified air safety workers.",
      "The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX issued his appeal on X Tuesday, citing \"a shortage of top notch air traffic controllers,\" adding that \"If you have retired, but are open to returning to work, please consider doing so.\"",
      "The FAA has faced a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, while the agency's oversight of the skies has recently faced heightened scrutiny following a\u00a0string of recent aviation incidents. Currently, more than 90% of U.S. airport towers are understaffed, and do not meet standards set by a working group that includes the FAA and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday announced an effort to \"supercharge\" the hiring of air traffic controllers following a visit to an FAA training institute in Oklahoma, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "\"I witnessed firsthand the dedication, skill and rigor that our future air traffic controllers bring to their training and the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.\"",
      "The FAA announced an air traffic controller hiring window between Feb. 27 and Mar. 17. It said the hiring process will be more efficient by becoming a five-step, rather than an eight-step process. Starting salaries for candidates are also being by 30%; the average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year, the FAA noted.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",
      "Duffy has said he wants to extend a waiver to the current controllers who are near retirement age to help expand the workfroce.",
      "Earlier this month, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing air traffic controllers, told CBS the proposal is not \"an effective solution to addressing the chronic air traffic controller staffing crisis. \"In the next 12 months, we anticipate 49 ATCs across 35 facilities will reach age 56.\u00a0This is not enough to address the nationwide staffing shortage,\" the union added.",
      "\"The solution to the ATC staffing crisis is a long-term commitment to hiring and training and the retention of the experience of all the highly skilled, highly trained air traffic controllers,\" it added.",
      "Shortage goes back to pandemic",
      "In its Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, the FAA blames its struggle to staff air traffic control facilities in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA,\" the agency said in its report. \"At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities.",
      "There are currently a number of open air traffic control jobs on the FAA's website, including for air traffic control and traffic management specialists and at various stages of their careers. Robust training is required to become an air traffic controller, including the completion of training courses at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. According to the FAA, air traffic control specialists earn a median annual wage of $127,805, plus benefits.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

      "On Monday, the FAA\u00a0said\u00a0on X that it \"has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska.\" The agency also said it is testing one Starlink terminal at the FAA's facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and at two terminals at \"non-safety critical sites\" in Alaska.",
      "Bloomberg News\u00a0reported on Monday that Musk last week approved 4,000 Starlink terminals to be shipped to the FAA for testing, citing a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The FAA told CBS News that \"no decisions have been made\" about a long-term contract to upgrade its air traffic control systems.",
      "Representatives for Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Potential conflict",
      "Lawmakers and experts on government contracts have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest for Musk, who is spearheading the Trump administration's effort to slash federal funding even as companies like SpaceX do business with the government.",
      "Asked by CBS News whether Musk's involvement could pose a conflict of interest given that the FAA regulates SpaceX and his companies are a major user of the airspace, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month that the entrepreneur isn't involved in setting agency policy.",
      "\"I was very conscious of anyone who comes in \u2014 I don't want to see conflicts of interest,\" Duffy said on Feb. 19 from the FAA's ATC Command Center in Warrenton, Virginia. \"So [Musk] was talking to air traffic controllers, didn't plug into the system, but looked at the terminals that they use... They had a back and forth about what works well for you, what doesn't work well.\"",
      "\"[T]hey spoke freely about these are the problems that we have. And so it was nothing about the way that SpaceX uses the airspace. It was about how do controllers do their job,\" Duffy added.",
      "Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The George Washington University Law School, noted that federal regulations prohibit government contractors from having conflicts of interest, and warn even against the mere appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog focused on reducing government corruption, told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's close relationship with President Trump could amount to a conflict of interest.",
      "\"You do worry if there is pressure from the top, even from the president himself, to favor his system over the existing system,\" Amey said. \"People could be afraid to lose their jobs and will do whatever they can to please Elon Musk.\"",
      "Such contracting decisions should be made \"by career civil servants doing what is in the best interest of taxpayers,\" he added.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers said the FAA moving to adopt Starlink's technology raises potential ethical concerns.",
      "\"How much richer will Elon get with an FAA contract to another one of his companies? My ELON MUSK Act would stop this blatant corruption,\" Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, wrote on X on Tuesday, referring to proposed legislation that would direct federal agencies to end any contracts held by a special government employee, similar to bans that apply to members of Congress and other federal employees.",

Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to vote against her nomination, while three Democrats \u2014 Sens.

Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress, which did not advance past introduction. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize. During her confirmation hearing last week, the former lawmaker addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect\" and she backs right-to-work laws, which allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",

      "Why is Starbucks removing drinks from its menu?",
      "The less commonly purchased drinks were complex to make and were too similar to other more popular offerings, creating menu redundancies, a Starbucks spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The drink cuts, along with some food changes, reflect about a 30% reduction of menu items, according to Starbucks.",
      "The brand said it's responding to customer trends and preferences in making the changes.",
      "\"As part of our plan to get back to Starbucks, we're simplifying our menu to focus on fewer, more popular items, executed with excellence,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"This will make way for innovation, help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company. \"",
      "When will the Starbucks drink menu change?",
      "The Starbucks menu changes will go into effect on March 4.",
      "The company offers recommendations for fans of the soon-to-be eliminated drinks to try instead. For example, a spokesperson encouraged Iced Matcha Lemonade fans to try the Green Tea Lemonade, which will remain on the menu.",
      "For fans of the Royal English Breakfast Latte, the London Fog Latte shares similar sweet floral notes, a spokesperson said.",
      "Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College, lauded the coming menu changes as a step in the right direction for the coffee company, but said this move alone won't be enough to turn the brand around.",
      "\"I think about Starbucks and the amount of frustration people have when they're ordering and want to pick something up and it's not ready; there's a lot of confusion,\" he said. \"And Brian Niccol is good at figuring out how to uncomplicate things and speed up operations by getting rid of things that are not working.\"",
      "As far as the menu changes go, while a small share of customers might miss the beverages that are being eliminated, Starbucks probably \"did the math and figured the cost of keeping them on the menu was greater than the benefits,\" Cohan said.",
      "\"The dissatisfaction of those few customers is a small price to pay and hopefully they will get better service and other products those customers want to buy instead,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Sales data show many Europeans, seemingly angry with Elon Musk as he navigates his close relationship with President Trump to influence U.S. policy, may be choosing to steer clear of Tesla vehicles. A sharp decline in sales comes as anti-Musk ads appear in the U.K. and other countries alluding a comparison to Adolf Hitler.",
      "Tesla new vehicle sales fell across the continent by nearly half in January, plunging by 45% year-on-year, according to data compiled by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). In hard numbers, Tesla sold just under 9,950 vehicles in Europe in January. For the same month in 2024, the company sold just over 18,100 new vehicles.",
      "The drop in sales has hurt Tesla's share price, which had nearly doubled in the first month after Mr. Trump's election victory to a record high. Most of those gains have since been lost, and Tesla's market cap has plunged below the $1 trillion mark. The stock, which as of early Wednesday traded for roughly $305 in the U.S., remains up 54% over the last 12 months, buoyed by the company's ambitious plans for self-driving cars and humanoid robots.",
      "In Germany, Tesla sales fell nearly 60% in January year-on-year as would-be buyers voted with their wallets \u2014 possibly angered by Musk's purported meddling in the country's federal elections last weekend, which saw the far-right AfD party he backed become the country's second most popular.",
      "In France, Tesla's sales in January fell 63%. The plunge came after Musk backed far-right parties in that country and attacked left-leaning ones, although the impact of his political activities on Tesla's financial performance is hard to gauge and could reflect other factors, such as mounting competition from other EV makers.",
      "Tesla sales in the U.S. have also been declining, falling 1% in 2024 compared to the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years despite global EV sales rising 7.3%. As CBS News' MoneyWatch reported this week, Wall Street analysts have said Musk's political activities could alienate consumers previously loyal to the brand, and protests have erupted at a number of Tesla dealerships in the U.S.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" analysts for the U.S. financial services firm Wedbush wrote in a Tuesday company report on the automaker. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November. That said, we view this as containable brand issues for Tesla for now that are not a major cause for concern.\"",
      "A similar trend has been seen in Europe. While Tesla's European sales numbers plunged in January, ACEA data show sales of electric vehicles overall surged by 34%, with buyers increasingly eyeing options from China and the continent's own automakers.",
      "In the U.K., after Musk attacked Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called for the release of a jailed far-right activist, January sales fell a comparatively gentler 12% year-on-year, but anger at Musk has been visible on British roadsides after an activist group called \"Everybody Hates Elon\" pasted over bus stop ads with posters showing Musk making a hand gesture that strongly resembled a Nazi salute at one of Mr. Trump's inauguration events.",
      "Musk has neither admitted nor denied his intent with the gesture, but he mocked the criticism of it, saying in a message on his social media platform X that, \"the 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"",
      "On the protest group's posters, the words \"0 to 1939 in three seconds\" appear above the image of Musk, alluding to the start of World War II.",

    "story": [
      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",

      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",

      "\"The Conference Board's survey mirrors the Michigan survey in showing that consumers' confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and employment,\" Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "\"The weakness of confidence strongly suggests that recent rapid growth in spending on durable goods mostly reflects households pre-empting tariffs,\" he added.",
      "The Conference Board's report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.3 points to 72.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.",
      "\"This index says that consumers are rattled. Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" analysts with High-Frequency Economics said in report. \"The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election might not be a coincidence,\" they added.",
      "Growing pessimism",
      "Consumers' view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.",
      "\"Views of current labor market conditions weakened,\" the group said Tuesday. \"Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\"",
      "Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. However, U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with cold weather taking some of the blame for a dent in vehicle sales and at retail stores.",
      "Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of healthy gains.",
      "Inflation has also remained sticky. So much so that the Federal Reserve has taken a more cautious approach to interest rates, leaving its benchmark borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. Fed officials have also expressed uncertainty over the new administration's policies.",

      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",

      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",
      "Lithium deposits, meanwhile, are scattered across Ukraine's central, east and southeast regions \u2014 the latter of which are currently held largely by Russia. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries found in everything from electric vehicles to laptops and smartphones.",
      "Ukraine also holds about 20% of the world's global reserves of graphite. Commonly used in pencils, the soft substance is also used in industrial lubricants for motors and other machinery.",
      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed the U.S. has given Ukraine $350 billion in assistance since the war started three years ago, and made it clear he wants to get that back.",
      "Ukraine Oversight, a U.S. interagency watchdog group, says the U.S. has provided no more than $183 billion, however, and roughly a third of that was spent domestically in the U.S. to manufacture ammunition and other weapons and equipment to be used by Ukraine.",

      "Earlier Friday, sources familiar with the directive confirmed to CBS News the new email was expected to come from individual federal agencies, not the Office of Personnel Management, as was the case with the emails sent last week. That government-wide directive caused confusion as to whether a response was required \u2014 and the possible ramifications of not answering.",
      "With this new round of emails, OPM advised agencies to send the messages themselves, and each department has the discretion to decide whether to do so, sources told CBS News earlier Friday. The emails are part of a strategy to have agencies account for their employees' work each week and report it back to the government's human resources agency, though no decision has been made about whether the messages will go out weekly, the sources said.",

DHS employees have until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time Monday to respond.",

He tasked Elon Musk to lead the cost-cutting effort through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, though the billionaire is not the administrator of the task force. The White House confirmed earlier this week that Amy Gleason, who worked at the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE, is its acting administrator.",
      "But Musk and his team have roiled the federal government with their initiative; as thousands of probationary federal workers were fired, DOGE employees have sought access to departments' data systems housing sensitive information and work at some independent agencies has ground to a halt.",
      "Their actions have sparked numerous lawsuits, and on Thursday, a federal judge in California found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful.",
      "The initial round of emails sent to the federal workforce last Saturday came from OPM with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" It directed recipients to reply with five examples of what they accomplished in the prior week and include their bosses in the response. Government employees had until 11:59 p.m. Monday to answer and were told not to \"send any classified information, links, or attachments.\"",
      "Musk had initially warned on social media that a failure to respond \"will be taken as a resignation,\" but several agencies, including the FBI and Departments of State, Homeland Security and Defense, told their employees to ignore the request. OPM then told human resources officials from departments Monday that it was up to each agency to decide how they would handle the emails to their workers.",
      "But a memo also sent Monday to agency leaders that sought to provide guidance on the government-wide \"what did you do last week\" email said responses should be directed to department leadership, with a copy going to OPM.",

    "story": [
      "The signing of a key minerals agreement with Ukraine and a scheduled news conference Friday by President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were abruptly canceled and the Ukrainian leader's visit cut short after an Oval Office meeting that included Vice President JD Vance descended into insults and chaos.",
      "Afterward, the Ukrainians left the Oval Office to head to a \"separated room,\" while the U.S. team stayed in the Oval Office, a White House official said. While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.",
      "The contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\"",
      "Later in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy.",
      "\"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.",
      "The meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.",
      "Zelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration\u00a0Putin violated\u00a0the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which\u00a0had been signed\u00a0by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\"",
      "\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance.",
      "Vance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.",
      "\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.",
      "Zelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.",
      "Vance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.",
      "\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.",
      "Zelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"",
      "\"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"",
      "\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"",
      "\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.",
      "Zelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.",
      "\"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\"",
      "Mr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.",
      "\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.",
      "\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.",
      "Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire?",
      "\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"",
      "Earlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.",
      "\"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.",
      "\"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\"",
      "The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"",
      "\"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m.",
      "After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0@POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.",
      "As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.",
      "\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\"",
      "Administration sources on next steps",
      "High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.",
      "When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.",
      "No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "Zelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported.",
      "Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.",
      "The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.",
      "What to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit",
      "Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.",
      "In a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.",
      "\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\"\u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.",
      "\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.",
      "\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.",
      "Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.",
      "Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"",
      "The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.",
      "\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"",
      "But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.",
      "\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.",
      "\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.",

    "story": [
      "Washington, D.C. \u2014 The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border illegally in President Trump's first full month in office plunged to a level not seen in at least 25 years, according to preliminary government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "Last month, Border Patrol recorded about 8,450 apprehensions of migrants who crossed into the country unlawfully between official entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border, the statistics show.",
      "On some days during a record spike in illegal crossings under the Biden administration, Border Patrol recorded more than 8,000 apprehensions in a single day.",
      "February's total, which could be adjusted when the government officially publishes the statistics, would be the lowest monthly apprehensions tally recorded by Border Patrol since at least fiscal year 2000, the last period with public monthly data. The final tallies usually don't deviate much from the preliminary figures.",
      "Over the past 25 years, the only time monthly apprehensions came close to the level recorded in February was in April 2017, when Border Patrol apprehended 11,000 migrants at the southwest border, agency data show.",
      "While monthly data before fiscal year 2000 is not publicly available, the last time Border Patrol averaged roughly 8,000 apprehensions per month over a year was in fiscal year 1968, according to historical statistics.",
      "Illegal crossings along the U.S. southern border have been trending downward over the past year, including under the Biden administration, after spiking to an all-time high in late 2023.",
      "They first dropped in early 2024 after Mexican officials expanded efforts to stop migrants from reaching the U.S. border and then fell further in the summer following former President Biden's move to sharply restrict access to the asylum system.",
      "But the reduction in illegal immigration has been precipitous since Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "In January, Border Patrol agents at the Mexican border recorded 29,000 apprehensions, down 38% from 47,000 in December. The drop from January to February was even more pronounced, amounting to a roughly 70% decrease.",
      "Trump administration officials have credited their sweeping, government-wide immigration crackdown for the dramatic decrease in unlawful crossings.",
      "At the U.S.-Mexico border, the Trump administration has empowered federal officials to swiftly deport migrants without hearing their asylum claims, under the premise that the country is facing an \"invasion.\"",
      "U.S. law says migrants on American soil generally have the right to claim asylum to delay or halt their deportation. Trump administration officials have argued the system has been systematically abused by smugglers and economic migrants, who don't qualify for asylum.",
      "Mr. Trump has also directed the American military to help with immigration enforcement, deploying thousands of additional troops to the southern border and tasking military planes with deporting migrants.",
      "While Biden also moved to curtail asylum during his last year in office, Mr. Trump's unprecedented actions are far more restrictive.",
      "Unlike the Biden administration, for example, the Trump administration is not processing, in any significant capacity, asylum-seekers at official border entry points. In fact, a Biden-era system that facilitated that processing through a government app was quickly terminated.",
      "The Trump administration is also considering adding another layer to its restrictions at the border, making plans to invoke a public health law known as Title 42 to summarily expel migrants on the grounds that they could spread diseases like tuberculosis.",
      "Whether migrant flows continue dropping, plateau or increase in the coming weeks and months remains unclear. Historically, migrant arrivals at the southern border have increased in the springtime.",
      "While its border strategy has yielded quick results, the Trump administration's efforts in the U.S. interior, where the president has promised to conduct the largest deportation operation in American history, have encountered significant obstacles.",
      "Top Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been reassigned in recent weeks amid frustrations that the agency is not carrying out sufficient arrests and deportations.",
      "ICE's detention capacity has also been stretched thin. As of Friday, ICE detention centers were at 117% capacity, with the agency detaining more than 45,000 migrants, 20,000 of whom were first apprehended at the southern border, according to internal government data.",

    "summary": "Iowa's governor signed legislation removing gender identity protections on Friday from the state's civil rights code, despite large, intense protests.",
    "story": [
      "Des Moines, Iowa \u2014\u00a0 Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed legislation to remove gender identity protections from the state's civil rights code on Friday.",
      "In a statement released by her office after the bill was signed, Reynolds \u2013 a Republican and first woman to hold the governor's office in Iowa \u2014 said the Civil Rights Code blurred the biological line between the sexes and forced Iowa taxpayers to pay for gender reassignment surgeries.",
      "She said it was \"unacceptable to me, and it is unacceptable to most Iowans,\" saying the bill simply brings the state in line with the federal Civil Rights Code.",
      "\"We all agree that every Iowan, without exception, deserves respect and dignity. We are all children of God, and no law changes that,\" Reynolds said in the statement.",
      "\"What this bill does accomplish is to strengthen protections for women and girls, and I believe that is the right thing to do.\"",
      "Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state's civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state's civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \"shall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\"",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \"Trans rights are human rights\" and chanting slogans including \"No hate in our state!\"",
      "There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \"Shame!\" as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and fiercely defended it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens what he called \"commonsense\" laws to ban transgender participation in sports\u00a0and access to bathrooms.",
      "\"The legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\" Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers' actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state's hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa's current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state's Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\"",
      "\"The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\" Wichtendahl said. \"The sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\"",
      "When she finished speaking, she got a standing ovation from many legislators and onlookers in the gallery, reports CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI-TV.",
      "The station said that after the Senate passed the bill, a man started yelling from the gallery, calling lawmakers \"fascists\" and asking \"Who's next?\" Three state troopers carried him out. Others who were yelling were also removed.",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa's Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Trump.",
      "He also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women's sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",

    "story": [
      "European allies were quick to stand up for Ukraine after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance openly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a sharply contentious Oval Office meeting Friday.",
      "Zelenskyy and his Ukrainian team were told to leave the White House earlier than planned Friday and an important minerals agreement went unsigned, a White House official said, after a heated exchange in which Mr. Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being insufficiently grateful for U.S. support. The president told Zelenskyy he's \"gambling with World War III\" and did not acknowledge Russia's role in its assault on Ukraine.",
      "Russia immediately praised the president and vice president's admonishments of Zelenskyy. After the televised showdown, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia's security council, backed Mr. Trump on X: \"The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,\" the Russian official said of Zelenskyy. \"And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'\"",
      "European allies leapt to defend Ukraine, and Zelenskyy reshared on X over 20 of their social media posts and thanked them.",
      "\"Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\" wrote Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council. \"Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You will never be alone, dear President @ZelenskyyUa.\"",
      "\"There is an aggressor: Russia,\" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X, in a translated post. \"There is a people under attack: Ukraine. We were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago and to continue to do so.\"",
      "\"Luxembourg stands with Ukraine,\" wrote Luc Frieden, prime minister of Luxembourg.",
      "Thank you for your support. https://t.co/8miNebF718",
      "Congressional Republicans have mostly fallen in line behind Mr. Trump, denouncing Zelenskyy's demeanor in the Oval Office meeting, while others have remained silent.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has been supportive of Ukraine, condemned Zelenskyy. Graham said he spoke with the Ukrainian leader Friday morning and warned him \"don't take the bait.\"",
      "\"I don't know if we could ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham told reporters outside the White on Friday. \"He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Washington, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, echoed the call for Zelenskyy to resign \"for the good of his country.\"",
      "\"Whatever your view on what happened in today's bizarre televised WH diplomatic meeting, the West needs US and Ukrainian leadership trust on confronting Russia. After today, that likely requires a new Ukrainian leader,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, however, defended Ukraine.",
      "\"A bad day for America's foreign policy. Ukraine wants independence, free markets and rule of law. It wants to be part of the West,\" he told CBS News. \"Russia hates us and our Western values. We should be clear that we stand for freedom.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, a staunch Ukraine ally who serves as co-chair of the House Ukraine Caucus, said the meeting was \"heartbreaking\" to watch.",
      "\"It is time to put understandable emotions aside and come back to the negotiation table. This can and will be fixed,\" he said in a statement. \"I am confident that the parties will reconvene in pursuit of a mutually agreeable solution that best serves the interests of the United States of America and Ukraine. This is the only acceptable outcome.\"",
      "Republican senators who have been supportive of Ukraine and not shy against disagreeing with Mr. Trump have yet to share their opinions, including Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "The House or Senate were not in session Friday, making it more likely that lawmakers will be asked about the meeting in their districts or states over the weekend or when they return to the Capitol on Monday.",
      "Democrats in Congress widely criticized Mr. Trump, calling him \"a useful idiot for Putin\" and \"an embarrassment.\"",
      "Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was among the bipartisan group of senators who\u00a0talked with Zelenskyy\u00a0just before his White House visit and posted a hopeful picture before the fateful White House meeting.",
      "Really good bipartisan meeting before President Zelensky heads to the White House. We stand with Ukraine.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 pic.twitter.com/s5NJx0BcKZ",
      "Afterward, Klobuchar\u00a0responded\u00a0to Vance on X that \"Zelenskyy has thanked our country over and over again both privately and publicly.\"",
      "\"And our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of Europe,\" she added. \"Shame on you.\"",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Trump had thrown \"a temper tantrum in the Oval Office.\"",
      "\"This is just the latest in a string of alarming gestures made by Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin \u2014 excluding Ukraine and our allies from negotiations, refusing to hold Russia accountable for its invasion, parroting Kremlin propaganda, attempting to extort Ukraine at gunpoint, and siding with Russia at the UN. It's a dangerous pattern of deference to a dictator who seeks to undermine democracy worldwide,\" Meeks said.",
      "\"It is not President Zelensky who disrespected the United States in the Oval Office,\" he continued. \"It was Donald Trump-behaving exactly like the two-bit mob boss we've known him to be.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, characterized Mr. Trump's conduct as \"downright un-American.\"",

    "summary": "Ukrainian officials reached out to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track, but President Trump was unwilling to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy further today, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. military aid to Ukraine could be in jeopardy after a contentious Oval Office meeting Friday between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to administration officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "The day started on a positive note, with Mr. Trump joking with Zelenskyy, a guest book signing and warm conversation in the Oval Office.",
      "But the episode has raised questions about whether Zelenskyy can move forward toward a peace deal, and whether the U.S. will or should pause aid to Ukraine.",
      "Though several of the president's allies have called on Zelenskyy to step down or \"change,\" Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, according to the officials, who said there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than its current president.",
      "Multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy left the White House Friday afternoon to ask how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "No phone calls between Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the officials said.",
      "Still, the administration believes that the Ukrainian leader has put his country in a terrible position and that he missed out on a huge opportunity to have the U.S. as a business partner, with U.S. companies working on helping Ukraine monetize their mineral resources, such as gas and oil, aluminum and tritium and others.",
      "The minerals deal was set to be signed with much pomp and circumstance, and it was the first step in what Mr. Trump foresaw as a progression towards peace. According to the officials, Mr. Trump fully intended to sign the minerals deal. Two official binders were prepared and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Ukrainian counterpart, Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump were going to sit at a conference table in the East Room to trumpet the success.",
      "But there were suspicions before Zelenskyy arrived on Friday that it might fall apart. The Trump administration had been pushing for weeks for a minerals deal signing at the ministerial level, but Ukraine refused. Zelenskyy wanted security guarantees in exchange.",
      "And following the Oval Office meeting, Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track, but Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the officials said.",
      "When Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mr. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz went to the Roosevelt Room, where Zelenskyy and his team were holding after the Oval Office meeting, Rubio made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counter-productive, the officials said. Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake and had done a disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.",
      "U.S. officials thought negotiations would be much harder with Russian President Vladimir Putin and have been in disbelief that it has been Zelenskyy who has been difficult, the sources said. Trump officials were concerned the Russians would come with all-or-nothing demands during a recent meeting in Riyadh, but they didn't. The negotiators had reasonable requests for Rubio and Waltz, but instead it has been Ukraine that has had maximalist demands, according to the Trump officials.",
      "The White House is now uncertain if they can get Russia and Ukraine to end the war that has dragged on for more than three years, the officials told CBS News.",
      "Asked how Zelenskyy can repair this, the Trump officials said the Ukrainian leader needs to explicitly say he wants a ceasefire, because it's now unclear to the administration that he would ever sign anything with Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader, speaking to Fox News' Bret Baier later Friday, rejected the notion that he wouldn't sign a peace agreement with Putin. He said, \"We will have negotiations,\" and reiterated that Ukraine must have security guarantees.",
      "\"We are ready for peace but we have to be in a strong position,\" Zelenskyy said. He also expressed confidence that the relationship with Mr. Trump can be salvaged.",
      "The U.S. has made it clear to Ukraine that Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership before talking about security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, if it happened, the officials disclosed. There have been no discussions among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, have all been talking to Mr. Trump and his team about troop presence in Ukraine and what the security guarantees would look like.",
      "Meanwhile, a defense official said there have been U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine since Jan. 20, but no new packages have been announced. What was in the pipeline committed by the Biden administration has been continuing. It sometimes takes months for certain items, like vehicles, to arrive in Ukraine.",
      "There is $3.85 billion left in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, according to two U.S. officials. This is spending authority, not appropriated money, which means that it is up to the White House, not Congress, to determine whether to release that or not. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere, it is just authority to give Ukraine weapons from U.S. stockpiles. It is up to Mr. Trump to decide whether to send Zelenskyy the remainder of that weaponry.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Rubio and could potentially be held or released. The State Department under the Trump administration has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",

      "In a series of notifications sent to Congress late Friday, the State Department said it had signed off on the sale of more than 35,500 MK 84 and BLU-117 bombs and 4,000 Predator warheads worth $2.04 billion.",

    "summary": "The move supercharges RFK Jr.'s authority to implement health policy changes.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended a longstanding transparency rule on Friday, supercharging his authority to change policies in areas ranging from Medicaid to the National Institutes of Health without advance notice to the public.",
      "Dubbed the \"Richardson Waiver\" after the former health secretary who issued the rule in 1971, the policy Kennedy repealed had required regulations related to property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts to go through the federal \"rulemaking\" process.",
      "The law governing rulemaking usually exempts such regulations, but in response to calls at the time to close the exemption, officials voluntarily waived it. This meant that, until now, they would go through the process of notifying the public of their proposals and asking for comments before imposing changes.",
      "\"The extra-statutory obligations of the Richardson Waiver impose costs on the Department and the public, are contrary to the efficient operation of the Department, and impede the Department's flexibility to adapt quickly to legal and policy mandates,\" Kennedy said in a filing announcing the end of the waiver.",
      "Now health agencies no longer need to go through the notice and comment process for many policy changes about grants and benefits. This includes new rules that could otherwise be stymied by backlash during a public comment period, like potentially adding in work requirements to Medicaid or redrawing how the National Institutes of Health funds research.",
      "\"It's hugely important, because getting rid of the Richardson Waiver means that the agency can move a lot faster to implement big new policy changes,\" said Samuel Bagenstos, professor of law at the University of Michigan.",
      "Bagenstos previously worked as the general counsel for HHS under the Biden administration. He said following the policy was a major hurdle, bogging down proposals that might have otherwise been finalized.",
      "\"Courts have held HHS to that waiver, so it's not just something they could ignore,\" he said. \"If you think about HHS, it's a $1.7 trillion department. The overwhelming majority of what it does is grants and benefits.\"",
      "The waiver was also cited earlier this month by state attorneys general as one argument in their legal challenge seeking to block the National Institutes of Health's controversial cuts to research funding. They quoted the first Trump administration supporting the waiver in a 2020 post by the department to the Federal Register.",
      "\"The Department believes that its decision-making ought to be as transparent as appropriate to better enable the citizenry to comment on its proposed rules and demonstration projects,\" Trump HHS officials had said.",
      "The Council on Governmental Relations, a group that represents research universities and other institutions, criticized Kennedy's decision Friday. The group's president, Matt Owens, told CBS News in a statement that it \"flies in the face of the Trump Administration's professed mandate for greater transparency.\"",
      "\"For decades HHS policies affecting public health and research institutions have benefitted from public stakeholder participation in the policy process. Public input is an essential element of the policy process that reflects our nation's democratic principles,\" he said.",

At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",

      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end.

      "Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, said Mr. Trump's actions amounted to an \"effective nullification of congressional will\" and from the bench, he granted the aid groups' request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Trump's executive order suspending the refugee resettlement program. Whitehead promised a written ruling in the next few days.",
      "But Wednesday aid groups, including Church World Service and the Jewish refugee resettlement organization HIAS, received notifications that their \"cooperative agreements\" with the State Department had been canceled.",
      "The groups on Thursday asked Whitehead for an emergency hearing to discuss the impact of the termination notices, or to make clear that his ruling also applies to those newly issued notices. The groups called the administration's actions a \"flagrant attempt\" to evade the court's ruling.",

      "The State Department acknowledged receipt of an email from The Associated Press about the plaintiffs' motion, but did not otherwise respond to questions about it.

      "The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution - a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It's different from asylum, through which people who have just arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country.",
      "Despite longstanding support from both parties for accepting refugees, the program has become politicized in recent years. Mr. Trump also temporarily halted it during his first term, and then dramatically decreased the number of refugees who could enter the U.S. each year.",
      "There are 600,000 people being processed to come to the U.S. as refugees around the world, according to the administration.",
      "Mr. Trump's order and the administration's subsequent withholding of funds stranded refugees who had already been approved to come to the U.S., forced the refugee aid groups to lay off staff and cut off short-term assistance, such as rent, for those who had recently resettled here, the organizations said in the lawsuit challenging the actions.",
      "Thursday's filing came the day after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to block another court order requiring it to release billions in suspended foreign aid.

      "Those who would take the voluntary separation incentive payment must opt in by March 14 and leave the agency no later than April 19. The option echoes the \"fork in the road\" or deferred resignation program from OPM, in which eligible federal employees could resign from their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The incentive payments offered the SSA is dependent on an employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. Those with a GS-8 or under would get $15,000, while those classified with GS-9 to GS-12 would receive $20,000. Those with a GS-13 or higher would receive $25,000.",

      "\"[King] knew it would hurt public service\" if these hires were allowed to take the offer, said Hornick, who is also an administrative director at an Illinois local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, which nationally represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers. \"Because we're at a 25-year staffing low.\"",
      "Now that this separation incentive is available to them, Hornick said she has \"no doubt\" these frontline employees will take it, and warned that processing times for claims could \"go through the roof.\"",
      "\"I have been trying to reassure [these] employees to take a deep breath. They're terrified, scared to death they will not have a job tomorrow, and put a roof over their head. It's just been one thing after another this week,\" Hornick added.",

      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would have been expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy ... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If such an explosion occurred over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "Aside from the nearly 0% chance the asteroid will miss Earth, the good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare if something were to change.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",
      "Still, NASA tracks close approaches and calculates the odds of those space rocks \u2014 including asteroids, meteors and meteorites \u2014 impacting Earth.",
      "\"The majority of near-Earth objects have orbits that don't bring them very close to Earth, and therefore pose no risk of impact, but a small fraction of them \u2013 called potentially hazardous asteroids \u2013 require more attention,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0the website of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the center dedicated to studying near-Earth objects for NASA.",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost lunar lander privately developed by Firefly Aerospace is carrying a suite of sophisticated instruments to the moon for NASA.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander closed in on the moon Saturday, on course for a nail-biting automated descent to touchdown early Sunday, the first of three private-sector robotic moon landers to reach its target after launches earlier this year.",
      "The Blue Ghost lunar lander spent a month orbiting Earth after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in January, giving Firefly flight controllers in Austin, Texas, plenty of time to activate and test its systems and science payloads before heading to the moon.",
      "Once there, the spacecraft spent 16 days in lunar orbit refining its trajectory and beaming back spectacular views of Earth from 240,000 miles away.",
      "Now, after multiple thruster firings to reach the planned descent orbit, the 6.6-foot-tall spacecraft is poised for a rocket-powered drop to the surface. Touchdown at Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 is expected around 3:34 a.m. EST, near an ancient volcanic feature called Mons Latreille.",
      "The solar-powered lander is expected to operate for a full lunar \"day,\" or 14 Earth days. If all goes well, it may continue operating on battery power for a few hours into the dark lunar night before finally going silent.",
      "Firefly CEO Jason Kim said the Blue Ghost is the latest example of commercial technology provided by the private sector \"really bringing down the cost and affordability of (space) systems.\"",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" he said in a pre-launch interview with CBS News.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "NASA paid Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored  science instruments, built at a cost of $44 million, to the moon as  part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)  initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private  industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science  and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the  surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent another lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "For ispace's second attempt, the appropriately-named Resilience took a long, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to make its landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Firefly's lander is carrying 10 instruments, including cameras, a drill to bore into the surface below the spacecraft, a radiation-tolerant computer, equipment that will attempt to pull in GPS navigation signals from Earth, an experiment to learn more about managing lunar dust and one to monitor the dispersal of dust kicked up by the lander's rocket engines.",
      "\"One of the core purposes of the CLPS program with NASA is to be a precursor to Artemis, which is obviously sending humans back to the moon,\" said Ray Allensworth, Firefly's spacecraft program director.",
      "\"So our payloads are collecting data so we can figure out what does it feel like to be on the lunar surface, to operate on the lunar surface? So all that data will inform when we actually return humans to the moon.\"",

      "Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus could all be visible with clear skies, but not all can be seen by the naked eye, according to Space.com and other sites that track celestial events.",
      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York was expected to have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

    "story": [
      "With two commercial moon landers already on their way, Houston-based Intuitive Machines launched its second robotic lander atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday, the centerpiece of a multi-element NASA-sponsored mission to help pave the way for human expeditions.",
      "The workhorse rocket's nine first-stage engines roared to life at  7:16 p.m. EST, pushing the booster away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center atop 1.9 million pounds of thrust and a brilliant jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",
      "Given the on-time launch and assuming no major problems, the Athena lander is expected to descend to touchdown on a flat mesa-like structure known as Mons Mouton on March 6, setting down just 100 miles from the moon's south pole \u2014 closer than any other spacecraft has attempted.",
      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

      "NASA did note, however, that there was still a 1.7% chance that 2024 YR4 would impact the Moon on Dec. 22, 2032.",
      "When concerns over the asteroid were first raised, there was a possibility it could hit over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75% of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency when the odds of an impact were higher.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would have been expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy ... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If such an explosion occurred over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "Aside from the nearly 0% chance the asteroid will miss Earth, the good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare if something were to change.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",
      "Still, NASA tracks close approaches and calculates the odds of those space rocks \u2014 including asteroids, meteors and meteorites \u2014 impacting Earth.",
      "\"The majority of near-Earth objects have orbits that don't bring them very close to Earth, and therefore pose no risk of impact, but a small fraction of them \u2013 called potentially hazardous asteroids \u2013 require more attention,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0the website of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the center dedicated to studying near-Earth objects for NASA.",

      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",
      "Skype will be available until May 5, giving users about two months to decide which option they want to take.",

    "story": [
      "The Hague\u00a0\u2014 A global campaign has led to at least 25 arrests over child sexual abuse content generated by artificial intelligence and distributed online, Europol said Friday.",
      "\"Operation Cumberland has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material, making it exceptionally challenging for investigators due to the lack of national legislation addressing these crimes,\" the Hague-based European police agency said in a statement.",
      "The majority of the arrests were made Wednesday during the world-wide operation led by the Danish police, and which also involved law enforcement agencies from the EU, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. U.S. law enforcement agencies did not take part in the operation, according to Europol.",
      "It followed the arrest last November of the main suspect in the case, a Danish national who ran an online platform where he distributed the AI material he produced.",
      "After a \"symbolic online payment, users from around the world were able to obtain a password to access the platform and watch children being abused,\" Europol said.",
      "Online child sexual exploitation remains one of the most threatening manifestations of cybercrime in the European Union, the agency warned.",
      "It \"continues to be one of the top priorities for law enforcement agencies, which are dealing with an ever-growing volume of illegal content,\" it said, adding that more arrests were expected as the investigation continued.",
      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",
      "Just weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan bill called the \"TAKE IT DOWN Act\" that, if signed into law, would criminalize the \"publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \"deepfake revenge pornography\"), and requires social media and similar websites to implement procedures to remove such content within 48 hours of notice from a victim,\" according to a description on the U.S. Senate website.",
      "As it stands, some social media platforms have appeared unable or unwilling to crackdown on the spread of sexualized, AI-generated deepfake content, including fake images depicting celebrities. In mid-February, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had removed over a dozen fraudulent sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on Facebook.",

    "story": [
      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "DEI, aimed at promoting fairness in the workplace and opening career paths for people of color, women and other protected classes,\u00a0gained momentum\u00a0after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",

      "Cuomo, who resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after being accused of sexual harassment, began to\u00a0seriously consider entering the mayor's race\u00a0last week, CBS News New York reported.",

      "\"These conditions exist not as an act of God, but rather as an act of our political leaders, or more precisely, the lack of intelligent action by many of our political leaders,\" Cuomo said.",
      "The former governor, who racked up a number of accomplishments while in office, from rebuilding LaGuardia Airport and the Moynihan Train Station to legalizing same sex marriage, was also candid about the fact that during his time in public service, he made mistakes.",
      "\"Did I always do everything right in my years of government service?  Of course not. Would I do some things differently knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes, some painfully? Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it and I hope to show you that every day,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Why did Andrew Cuomo resign as governor?",

The investigation centered around claims from 11 different women.",

    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander closed in on the moon Saturday, on course for a nail-biting automated descent to touchdown early Sunday, the first of three private-sector robotic moon landers to reach its target after launches earlier this year.",
      "The Blue Ghost lunar lander spent a month orbiting Earth after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in January, giving Firefly flight controllers in Austin, Texas, plenty of time to activate and test its systems and science payloads before heading to the moon.",
      "Once there, the spacecraft spent 16 days in lunar orbit refining its trajectory and beaming back spectacular views of Earth from 240,000 miles away.",
      "Now, after multiple thruster firings to reach the planned descent orbit, the 6.6-foot-tall spacecraft is poised for a rocket-powered drop to the surface. Touchdown at Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 is expected around 3:34 a.m. EST, near an ancient volcanic feature called Mons Latreille.",
      "The solar-powered lander is expected to operate for a full lunar \"day,\" or 14 Earth days. If all goes well, it may continue operating on battery power for a few hours into the dark lunar night before finally going silent.",
      "Firefly CEO Jason Kim said the Blue Ghost is the latest example of commercial technology provided by the private sector \"really bringing down the cost and affordability of (space) systems.\"",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" he said in a pre-launch interview with CBS News.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "NASA paid Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored  science instruments, built at a cost of $44 million, to the moon as  part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)  initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private  industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science  and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the  surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent another lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "For ispace's second attempt, the appropriately-named Resilience took a long, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to make its landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Firefly's lander is carrying 10 instruments, including cameras, a drill to bore into the surface below the spacecraft, a radiation-tolerant computer, equipment that will attempt to pull in GPS navigation signals from Earth, an experiment to learn more about managing lunar dust and one to monitor the dispersal of dust kicked up by the lander's rocket engines.",
      "\"One of the core purposes of the CLPS program with NASA is to be a precursor to Artemis, which is obviously sending humans back to the moon,\" said Ray Allensworth, Firefly's spacecraft program director.",

    "story": [
      "From her home in Baker, Nevada, Elizabeth Woosley can see Andromeda,\u00a0the nearest galaxy to the Milky Way, with her naked eye. But she's one of the lucky ones as America's dark skies are rapidly disappearing.",
      "Woosley, the owner of the Stargazer Inn in Baker & Great Basin National Park, Nevada, is one of the state's dark sky lovers working to introduce millions of Americans to the importance of our nation's inky skies.",
      "Woosley, who grew up in New England, now lives in Baker, a town of 100 people. Alongside 20 of Baker's 100 residents, Woosley hopes to get dark skies designation for the area to lessen the light pollution from the street, house, business lights and other lighting sources.",
      "There are very few places left in the country where there is so little artificial light that the Milky Way is visible to the naked eye. Nevada is one such place, and to preserve that Woosley is part of a larger group of determined state residents dreaming up novel ways to raise funds to stop their dark skies from disappearing, including promoting \"astro-tourism,\" drives across large swathes of rural land in the dark of night \u2014 and even selling license plates.",
      "And after recent federal cuts in National Parks \u00a0\u2014 about 3,400 recently-hired employees with the U.S. Forest Service and 1,000 employees with the National Park Service were fired from their jobs last weekend under the Trump administration, accounting for 10% and 5% of those workforces, respectively \u2014 the stakes might be higher than ever.",
      "Most Americans live under light pollution",
      "These Nevada residents plan to save dark skies within their state borders \u2014 but also hope to inspire Americans across the nation to protect them. There are several dark sky areas in the United States,\u00a0the National Park Service says, including in Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Idaho.",
      "In 2019, Dark Sky International designated the first dark sky sanctuary on public land \u2014 as Nevada's Massacre Rim. (About 63% of Nevada's land is public.) Critics will say there are only about six truly dark areas, according to NASA maps, and other areas have light pollution.",
      "This matters, proponents say, because more than 80% of the world's population, and 99% of Americans and Europeans, live under sky glow - which causes big problems for humans, wildlife, and the environment. The natural circadian rhythms of humans and animals are disrupted by light pollution and have caused the decline of fireflies, the death of birds during migrations, and sea turtle confusion.",
      "In the U.S., about 19 states have laws limiting light pollution, and Texas has laws governing lights around military bases \u2014 but most areas have limited requirements. Dark Sky International says there are about 230 places around the world showing \"strong support\" for dark skies, and they created an interactive map for users to see if they live in a place impacted by light pollution.",
      "To ease the funding crunch needed to get dark skies designation \u2014 which was challenging before the latest federal cuts \u2014 local organization\u00a0Friends of Nevada Wilderness\u00a0started developing the idea for a \"Save Starry Skies\" license plate back in 2018. Program manager Pam duPre said it took years to get approval from the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles. The plates, designed by dark sky advocate Jonathan Boarini, were released in May 2024 for $61 - with $25 going to the Friends of Nevada Wilderness.",
      "About 2,000 plates have been sold and \"we expect that number to keep climbing,\" duPre told CBS News.",
      "Executive Director Shaaron Netherton said the funds will help rural communities get a dark sky designation, like Baker and Gerlach, a small town 100 miles north of Reno and the gateway to the annual festival \"Burning Man.\" Funding will also be used to promote astro-tourism, supporting local efforts to upgrade lighting and infrastructure to attract stargazers.",
      "Dark sky \"astro-tourism\"",
      "Dave Cooper, a long-time resident of Gerlach and defender of rural tourism and dark skies, like Woosley, has been working to promote \"astro-tourism\" in their area. Cooper, who retired from the Bureau of Land Management, has been living in rural Nevada for 24 years. The dark skies area in Nevada is \"the largest one on the lowest 48,\" and Cooper is working to develop dark sky tourism and \"astro-tourism\" in his area.",
      "Gerlach is an unincorporated community, so it is challenging to get all the lighting shields in place and infrastructure needed to keep the skies dark, Cooper says.",
      "Both Cooper and Woosley feel once visitors come to experience the majestic nature of truly dark skies, things will change for the better.",
      "\"People don't see dark skies as a resource,\" said Woosley, adding that dark skies haven't gotten the same attention as parks or beaches.",
      "Woosley said she didn't truly understand the depth of dark skies until she came out West. She was a teacher in Washington D.C. married to a national park ranger for three decades when they moved out to Great Basin National Park in 2018.",
      "The couple lived in the park for a few years before buying Stargazer Inn, opening it on March 4, 2022. About 150,000 visitors a year come to Great Basin National Park.",
      "\"We are quite remote,\" said Woosley, who says the inn is open 11 months a year.",
      "People come to star gaze, take new moon hikes, and see the Milky Way or stars.",

      "A day later she received an email, just a few short sentences, rescinding the contract's termination.",
      "The reversal failed to put her mind at ease.",
      "\"This is what our everyday looks like. The government is in a state of chaos,\" Salem said. \"And the way that we see that is 24 hours ago, we had a contract terminated, and 10 minutes ago [the termination] was rescinded.\"",
      "In the weeks since Elon Musk, an adviser to President Trump and the richest person in the world, began targeting the State Department agency USAID for closure, disruptions to the supply chain and services for a variety of global life-saving causes have faltered.",
      "While Salem's contract has remained active, except for most of Wednesday, she said the hollowing out of USAID \u2014 with nearly all of its staff suddenly placed on leave or outright fired \u2014 has caused growing disarray. Most pressing, she said, is that the USAID-operated payment system she relies on \"has been down for weeks.\"",
      "That's created unparalleled uncertainty that is spreading from her business of 150 employees to her American suppliers \u2014 farmers across 25 states \u2014 and the U.S. ocean liners she uses to ship hundreds of metric tons of Edesia's Plumpy'Nut therapeutic paste, and finally, to the international organizations that distribute it to children staving off death.",
      "\"Everybody who is caught up in this time of chaos with massive uncertainty is worried. Everybody is,\" Salem said.",
      "Plumpy'Nut is classified as a ready-to-use therapeutic food, prescribed for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children as young as six months old. It's a peanut-based paste that includes vitamins, minerals and milk powder, in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Edesia says it produces 800 metric tons of Plumpy'Nut and other foods used to treat malnutrition every week.",
      "Salem believes ultimately that her company's goal of protecting children aligns with Trump administration priorities. \"We have a strong belief that our mission will be protected, that these funds will be there, but I can't promise that to anyone.\"",
      "Salem said she agrees that USAID could be operated more efficiently, and she has ideas from years of work with the agency. She faces the same dilemma, whether she wants to propose solutions or simply try to process payments.",
      "\"Who should I call?\" She asked. \"I have been offering suggestions for years, and now is the time for someone to listen, if I can just find someone who will pick up the phone.\"",
      "A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that it had ended more than 90% of its USAID contracts, retaining only those that it believes make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. The agency's cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to drastically shrink the federal workforce and budget.",
      "Each packet of Plumpy'Nut produced by Edesia is printed with the phrase \"from the American people\" printed on it. Salem said the message to the desperate parents and caretakers of malnourished children is an important part of her company's mission.",
      "\"They will never, ever forget that it was the American people who were there for them in their biggest time of crisis,\" Salem said.",
      "She and others who run organizations associated with USAID told CBS News another global superpower is poised to step in if the United States retreats from corners of the world where it provides support for crucial medical care: China.",
      "\"This is an incredibly strong use of soft power to deliver a food, a specialized food to people in their biggest time of need,\" Salem said.",

It's a dangerous pattern of deference to a dictator who seeks to undermine democracy worldwide,\" Meeks said.",

    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander closed in on the moon Saturday, on course for a nail-biting automated descent to touchdown early Sunday, the first of three private-sector robotic moon landers to reach its target after launches earlier this year.",
      "The Blue Ghost lunar lander spent a month orbiting Earth after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in January, giving Firefly flight controllers in Austin, Texas, plenty of time to activate and test its systems and science payloads before heading to the moon.",
      "Once there, the spacecraft spent 16 days in lunar orbit refining its trajectory and beaming back spectacular views of Earth from 240,000 miles away.",
      "Now, after multiple thruster firings to reach the planned descent orbit, the 6.6-foot-tall spacecraft is poised for a rocket-powered drop to the surface. Touchdown at Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 is expected around 3:34 a.m. EST, near an ancient volcanic feature called Mons Latreille.",
      "The solar-powered lander is expected to operate for a full lunar \"day,\" or 14 Earth days. If all goes well, it may continue operating on battery power for a few hours into the dark lunar night before finally going silent.",
      "Firefly CEO Jason Kim said the Blue Ghost is the latest example of commercial technology provided by the private sector \"really bringing down the cost and affordability of (space) systems.\"",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" he said in a pre-launch interview with CBS News.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "NASA paid Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored  science instruments, built at a cost of $44 million, to the moon as  part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)  initiative.",

It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent another lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "For ispace's second attempt, the appropriately-named Resilience took a long, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to make its landing attempt in May.",

    "story": [
      "The signing of a key minerals agreement with Ukraine and a scheduled news conference Friday by President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were abruptly canceled and the Ukrainian leader's visit cut short after an Oval Office meeting that included Vice President JD Vance descended into insults and chaos.",
      "Afterward, the Ukrainians left the Oval Office to head to a \"separated room,\" while the U.S. team stayed in the Oval Office, a White House official said. While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.",
      "The contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\"",
      "Later in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy.",
      "\"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.",
      "The meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.",
      "Zelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration\u00a0Putin violated\u00a0the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which\u00a0had been signed\u00a0by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\"",
      "\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance.",
      "Vance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.",
      "\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.",
      "Zelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.",
      "Vance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.",
      "\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.",
      "Zelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"",
      "\"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"",
      "\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"",
      "\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.",
      "Zelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.",
      "\"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\"",
      "Mr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.",
      "\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.",
      "\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.",
      "Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire?",
      "\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"",
      "Earlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.",
      "\"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.",
      "\"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\"",
      "The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"",
      "\"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m.",
      "After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0@POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.",
      "As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.",
      "\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\"",
      "Administration sources on next steps",
      "High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.",
      "When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.",
      "No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "Zelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported.",
      "Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.",
      "The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.",
      "What to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit",
      "Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.",
      "In a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.",
      "\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\"\u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.",
      "\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.",
      "\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.",
      "Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.",
      "Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"",
      "The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.",
      "\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"",
      "But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.",
      "\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.",
      "\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.",

      "Kurdish militants who have waged a 40-year insurgency in Turkey declared a ceasefire on Saturday in what could mark a significant boost to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, two days after their imprisoned leader called for the group to disarm.",
      "The announcement by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, comes against the backdrop of fundamental changes in the region, including the reconfiguration of power in neighboring Syria after the toppling of President Bashar Assad, the weakening of the Hezbollah militant movement in Lebanon and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "The conflict between Turkey and the PKK has led to tens of thousands of deaths since it began in 1984. The ceasefire is the first sign of a breakthrough since peace talks between the PKK and Ankara broke down in the summer of 2015.",
      "The PKK declaration was published by the Firat News Agency, a media outlet close to the group, on Saturday. It referred to the insurgents' leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned by Turkey since 1999.",
      "\"We declare a ceasefire effective today to pave the way for the implementation of Leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society. None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,\" it said, referring to Ocalan by his nickname.",
      "On Thursday, a delegation of Kurdish politicians announced Ocalan's call for the PKK to lay down its arms and disband after visiting him on his island prison.",
      "The White House praised the call for peace, CBS News reported earlier this week.",
      "In its statement, the PKK's executive committee said Ocalan's call indicated that a \"new historical process has begun in Kurdistan and the Middle East.\" Kurdistan refers to the parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran inhabited by Kurds.",
      "While stating that it would \"comply with and implement the requirements of the call from our own side,\" the PKK emphasized that \"democratic politics and legal grounds must also be suitable for success.\"",
      "Ocalan's call came as the main pro-Kurdish political party in Turkey has faced pressure, with several of its mayors being removed from office in recent months and replaced by government appointees.",
      "The PKK also appealed for Ocalan to be released from Imrali prison, located in the Marmara Sea, to \"personally direct and execute\" a party congress that would lead to the militants laying down their arms.",
      "The peace initiative between the Turkish state and the PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies, was started in October by Erdogan's coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, a far-right politician who suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.",
      "Berkay Mandiraci, senior Turkey analyst with the\u00a0International Crisis Group\u00a0think tank, told CBS News a peace deal between the Turkish government and the PKK could \"remove this long-standing thorn in bilateral ties,\" and it could bring with it \"a host of dividends for Turkey.\"",

      "Some believe the main aim of the reconciliation effort is for Erdogan's government to garner Kurdish support for a new constitution that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his term ends.",
      "Bahceli has openly called for a new constitution, saying it was essential for Turkey's future that Erdogan remain in power. Erdogan and Bahceli are reportedly seeking parliamentary support from the pro-Kurdish People's Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM.",
      "\"There will be a series of meetings next week, including state officials and politicians, and many things will become clearer and more concrete. We hope that everything will be arranged in the next three months,\" said Sirri Sureyya Onder, one of the DEM members who visited Ocalan in prison on Thursday.",
      "The leader of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said Ocalan's call for a ceasefire does not apply to his group in Syria.",
      "Ocalan, 75, wields significant influence in the Kurdish movement despite his 25-year imprisonment, during which the PKK has been led by top figures who have fled and found sanctuary in the Kurdish region in northern Iraq.",
      "But a decade of fighting seems to have \"weakened\" the PKK, Mandiraci said. \"The Turkish military drove the group out of Turkey's southeast and pressed it deep into the steep and unforgiving mountains of northern Iraq,\" he said.",

    "summary": "In the weeks since the White House began targeting USAID for closure, services to a variety of life-saving causes have faltered.",
    "story": [
      "When Navyn Salem received a letter Wednesday terminating the federal government's contract with her Rhode Island company, Edesia, she halted its production line, which makes a life-saving paste for severely malnourished babies.",
      "A day later she received an email, just a few short sentences, rescinding the contract's termination.",
      "The reversal failed to put her mind at ease.",
      "\"This is what our everyday looks like. The government is in a state of chaos,\" Salem said. \"And the way that we see that is 24 hours ago, we had a contract terminated, and 10 minutes ago [the termination] was rescinded.\"",
      "In the weeks since Elon Musk, an adviser to President Trump and the richest person in the world, began targeting the State Department agency USAID for closure, disruptions to the supply chain and services for a variety of global life-saving causes have faltered.",
      "While Salem's contract has remained active, except for most of Wednesday, she said the hollowing out of USAID \u2014 with nearly all of its staff suddenly placed on leave or outright fired \u2014 has caused growing disarray. Most pressing, she said, is that the USAID-operated payment system she relies on \"has been down for weeks.\"",
      "That's created unparalleled uncertainty that is spreading from her business of 150 employees to her American suppliers \u2014 farmers across 25 states \u2014 and the U.S. ocean liners she uses to ship hundreds of metric tons of Edesia's Plumpy'Nut therapeutic paste, and finally, to the international organizations that distribute it to children staving off death.",
      "\"Everybody who is caught up in this time of chaos with massive uncertainty is worried. Everybody is,\" Salem said.",
      "Plumpy'Nut is classified as a ready-to-use therapeutic food, prescribed for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children as young as six months old. It's a peanut-based paste that includes vitamins, minerals and milk powder, in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Edesia says it produces 800 metric tons of Plumpy'Nut and other foods used to treat malnutrition every week.",
      "Salem believes ultimately that her company's goal of protecting children aligns with Trump administration priorities. \"We have a strong belief that our mission will be protected, that these funds will be there, but I can't promise that to anyone.\"",
      "Salem said she agrees that USAID could be operated more efficiently, and she has ideas from years of work with the agency. She faces the same dilemma, whether she wants to propose solutions or simply try to process payments.",
      "\"Who should I call?\" She asked. \"I have been offering suggestions for years, and now is the time for someone to listen, if I can just find someone who will pick up the phone.\"",
      "A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that it had ended more than 90% of its USAID contracts, retaining only those that it believes make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. The agency's cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to drastically shrink the federal workforce and budget.",
      "Each packet of Plumpy'Nut produced by Edesia is printed with the phrase \"from the American people\" printed on it. Salem said the message to the desperate parents and caretakers of malnourished children is an important part of her company's mission.",
      "\"They will never, ever forget that it was the American people who were there for them in their biggest time of crisis,\" Salem said.",
      "She and others who run organizations associated with USAID told CBS News another global superpower is poised to step in if the United States retreats from corners of the world where it provides support for crucial medical care: China.",
      "\"This is an incredibly strong use of soft power to deliver a food, a specialized food to people in their biggest time of need,\" Salem said.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 20:34:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Ukrainian officials reached out to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track, but President Trump was unwilling to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy further today, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. military aid to Ukraine could be in jeopardy after a contentious Oval Office meeting Friday between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to administration officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "The day started on a positive note, with Mr. Trump joking with Zelenskyy, a guest book signing and warm conversation in the Oval Office.",
      "But the episode has raised questions about whether Zelenskyy can move forward toward a peace deal, and whether the U.S. will or should pause aid to Ukraine.",
      "Though several of the president's allies have called on Zelenskyy to step down or \"change,\" Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, according to the officials, who said there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than its current president.",
      "Multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy left the White House Friday afternoon to ask how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "No phone calls between Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the officials said.",
      "Still, the administration believes that the Ukrainian leader has put his country in a terrible position and that he missed out on a huge opportunity to have the U.S. as a business partner, with U.S. companies working on helping Ukraine monetize their mineral resources, such as gas and oil, aluminum and tritium and others.",
      "The minerals deal was set to be signed with much pomp and circumstance, and it was the first step in what Mr. Trump foresaw as a progression towards peace. According to the officials, Mr. Trump fully intended to sign the minerals deal. Two official binders were prepared and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Ukrainian counterpart, Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump were going to sit at a conference table in the East Room to trumpet the success.",
      "But there were suspicions before Zelenskyy arrived on Friday that it might fall apart. The Trump administration had been pushing for weeks for a minerals deal signing at the ministerial level, but Ukraine refused. Zelenskyy wanted security guarantees in exchange.",
      "And following the Oval Office meeting, Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track, but Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the officials said.",
      "When Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mr. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz went to the Roosevelt Room, where Zelenskyy and his team were holding after the Oval Office meeting, Rubio made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counter-productive, the officials said. Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake and had done a disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.",
      "U.S. officials thought negotiations would be much harder with Russian President Vladimir Putin and have been in disbelief that it has been Zelenskyy who has been difficult, the sources said. Trump officials were concerned the Russians would come with all-or-nothing demands during a recent meeting in Riyadh, but they didn't. The negotiators had reasonable requests for Rubio and Waltz, but instead it has been Ukraine that has had maximalist demands, according to the Trump officials.",
      "The White House is now uncertain if they can get Russia and Ukraine to end the war that has dragged on for more than three years, the officials told CBS News.",
      "Asked how Zelenskyy can repair this, the Trump officials said the Ukrainian leader needs to explicitly say he wants a ceasefire, because it's now unclear to the administration that he would ever sign anything with Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader, speaking to Fox News' Bret Baier later Friday, rejected the notion that he wouldn't sign a peace agreement with Putin. He said, \"We will have negotiations,\" and reiterated that Ukraine must have security guarantees.",
      "\"We are ready for peace but we have to be in a strong position,\" Zelenskyy said. He also expressed confidence that the relationship with Mr. Trump can be salvaged.",
      "The U.S. has made it clear to Ukraine that Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership before talking about security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, if it happened, the officials disclosed. There have been no discussions among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, have all been talking to Mr. Trump and his team about troop presence in Ukraine and what the security guarantees would look like.",
      "Meanwhile, a defense official said there have been U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine since Jan. 20, but no new packages have been announced. What was in the pipeline committed by the Biden administration has been continuing. It sometimes takes months for certain items, like vehicles, to arrive in Ukraine.",
      "There is $3.85 billion left in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, according to two U.S. officials. This is spending authority, not appropriated money, which means that it is up to the White House, not Congress, to determine whether to release that or not. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere, it is just authority to give Ukraine weapons from U.S. stockpiles. It is up to Mr. Trump to decide whether to send Zelenskyy the remainder of that weaponry.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Rubio and could potentially be held or released. The State Department under the Trump administration has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",

      "In a series of notifications sent to Congress late Friday, the State Department said it had signed off on the sale of more than 35,500 MK 84 and BLU-117 bombs and 4,000 Predator warheads worth $2.04 billion.",

Repkon USA, located in Tampa, Florida, and The Boeing Company, located in St. Charles, Missouri, will manufacture the equipment, which is estimated to be delivered to Israel beginning in 2028.",
      "The arms sale comes as the first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of war, freed Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and enabled more humanitarian aid to reach Gaza, is set to expire on Saturday.",
      "The two sides seem willing to maintain their truce while negotiators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar guide talks aimed at getting to the next phase.",
      "The parties were supposed to have begun ironing out the details of phase two weeks ago. But talks were delayed as the first six weeks of the ceasefire were marred by disputes between Israel and Hamas over alleged violations of the deal.",
      "Under the terms of the truce that began in Jan. 19, the second phase would compel Hamas to release all the remaining living hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that triggered the war, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners in Israel, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Over the past six weeks, Hamas has freed 33 living and dead hostages in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners. The militant group still holds 59 captives, 32 of whom are believed to be dead.",

      "\"The Holy Father has always remained vigilant and oriented, collaborating in therapeutic maneuvers,\" the Vatican said. \"The prognosis therefore still remains reserved.\"",

      "\"The clinical picture remains complex, the criticality has subsided for the moment, but I would respect the caution of the doctors as the prognosis remains guarded,\" the sources said. There was no indication of how much longer the pontiff might remain hospitalized.",

      "A CT chest scan\u00a0taken Tuesday evening\u00a0showed the \"normal evolution\" of an infection as it is being treated. Blood tests have confirmed an improvement, according to the Vatican's update. The slight kidney insufficiency detected a few days ago has receded, and Francis is continuing to receive respiratory physiotherapy.",

      "\"I am making a call for the laying down of arms and I take on the historical responsibility for this call,\" Ocalan said in a letter read out by Kurdish politicians in Istanbul. \"All groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself.\"",
      "The PKK was established by Ocalan in 1978, initially seeking full independence and statehood for Turkey's large Kurdish minority, but later asking for autonomy. Since then, as many as 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of others displaced from their homes by the simmering conflict between the group and Turkish state forces. The PKK has carried out several major terrorist attacks in Turkey, killing scores of security forces but also civilians in Istanbul and Ankara.",
      "Ocalan was arrested in 1999 and is serving a life sentence in a prison in northwest Turkey, but he's still seen as the movement's ideological leader. The reading of his letter was broadcast on screens set up in majority Kurdish cities in the southeast of Turkey, where it was cheered by crowds hopeful for peace.",

      "As a NATO member, Turkey is a strategic ally of the U.S., and it has played a particularly vital role, given its location at the junction of Asia and the Middle East, in counterterrorism efforts and promoting Mideast stability.",
      "Close U.S. military cooperation with another Kurdish armed group based in neighboring Syria, the YPG, against ISIS during Syria's civil war, caused serious friction with Ankara. Turkey has long argued that the YPG is an extension of the PKK, and that American support for the Kurdish forces was therefor an indirect endorsement of and support for the PKK.",
      "The Trump administration welcomed Ocalan's call, with U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes telling CNN on Thursday that it was, \"a significant development and we hope that it will help assuage our Turkish allies about U.S. counter-ISIS partners in northeast Syria. We believe it will help bring peace to this troubled region.\"",
      "Berkay Mandiraci, senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank, told CBS News a peace deal between the Turkish government and the PKK could \"remove this long-standing thorn in bilateral ties,\" and it could bring with it \"a host of dividends for Turkey.\"",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also expressed support for Ocalan's disarmament call, with his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric telling reporters on Thursday that it was an \"important development\" that offered \"a glimmer of hope that could lead to a resolution of the long-standing conflict.\"",
      "Mandiraci told CBS News an agreement between Ankara and the PKK could also help bring stability to Syria.",
      "A new Syrian government, led by former Islamic extremist rebels who've disavowed militancy and publicly embraced secularism, is trying to assert itself and gain international support.",
      "Mandiraci said a peace deal with the PKK in Turkey could bolster ongoing talks between the Kurdish forces that were backed by the U.S. and Syria's interim government, aimed at integrating the Kurdish-controlled northeast region of Syria with the Syrian state.",
      "Why would the PKK disarm now?",
      "\"After a decade of intensive fighting, the PKK seems to be weakened,\" Mandiraci told CBS News, assessing the timing of Ocalan's call. \"The Turkish military drove the group out of Turkey's southeast and pressed it deep into the steep and unforgiving mountains of northern Iraq.\"",
      "So far, however, no information has been shared publicly regarding the details of any negotiations that led to Ocalan's call, nor how the process of disarming the group might actually work. The Turkish government has said nothing about what it might offer the PKK in exchange for disarmament.",
      "Ocalan's statement comes as the Turkish government faces accusations of a crackdown on dissent. Since local elections were held across the country in March 2024, more than 10 elected mayors have been removed from their posts and replaced by government appointees, mostly in Kurdish-majority cities.",
      "So far, Ocalan's call has drawn a muted response from Turkish officials. Efkan Ala, the deputy chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party, said the government was focused on the outcome, not the statement.",
      "\"The essence of the call is the laying down of arms and the dissolution of the terrorist organization,\" Ala said. \"We will look at the outcome. Of course, as Turkey, we will see whether this outcome will materialize.\"",
      "A similar attempt to end the fighting more than a decade ago failed, after a ceasefire that lasted two years collapsed in 2015, engulfing Turkish forces in a bloody conflict with the PKK.",

    "story": [
      "Boris Spassky, a Soviet-era world chess champion who lost his title to American Bobby Fischer in a legendary 1972 match that became a proxy for Cold War rivalries, died Thursday in Moscow. He was 88.",
      "His death was confirmed by the International Chess Federation, the game's governing body. No cause was given.",
      "Spassky was \"one of the greatest players of all time,\" the group said on social media. He \"left an indelible mark on the game.\"",
      "The Chess Federation of Russia called his death a \"great loss to the country,\" saying generations of chess players had learned from his matches.",
      "One of the first to react was Soviet grandmaster Anatoly Karpov, who told TASS state news agency: \"He was always one of my main idols.\"",
      "Spassky is best remembered for his duel with American Bobby Fischer in 1972, which was emblematic of the confrontation between East and West. The duel became known as the \"match of the century.\"",
      "The Soviet chess giant lived a checkered life, flitting between top-level clashes against the best players of the era and periods of virtual disappearance.",
      "Born in 1937 in Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg, Spassky showed prodigious talent early, becoming junior world champion and the youngest grandmaster in history at the time at 18.",
      "He said he learned to play chess at the age of five in an orphanage, having managed to flee Leningrad with his family when it was besieged by the Nazis during World War II.",
      "After the war, his aggressive style of play without fear of sacrifice was noticed by his peers and encouraged by the state, which provided him with a scholarship and a coach.",
      "Having made a strong impression, he found himself in the shadow of another rising figure in Soviet chess, Mikhail Tal, the so-called \"Magician of Riga\".",
      "It was not until 1961 that Spassky made a remarkable comeback by winning the USSR Championship.",
      "Eight years later he defeated his compatriot Tigran Petrosian to take the world title.",
      "\"I never set myself the goal of becoming world champion. Everything worked out by itself. I was progressing in leaps and bounds,\" Spassky said in 2016.",
      "Yugoslav grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric said that Spassky's secret strength \"lay in his colossal skill in adapting himself to the different styles of his opponents,\" the Washington Post reported.",
      "\"Colossal responsibility\"",
      "But Spassky would keep his title for just three years.",
      "In 1972 in Iceland he played the match that would define his career, against the American prodigy Fischer.",
      "With the Cold War at its height and the Soviet Union having dominated the game for years, Spassky faced a must-win situation in his match-up with the eccentric 29-year-old, who openly criticised Soviet chess players.",
      "But after a comfortable start for Spassky, the American roared back to win, ending an unbroken streak of Soviet world champions since 1948.",
      "Although the loss was a slap in the face for Moscow, for Spassky it was a relief to be rid of a \"colossal responsibility.\"",
      "\"You can't imagine how relieved I was when Fischer took the title away from me. I freed myself from a very heavy burden and breathed freely,\" he said nearly four decades later.",
      "The iconic Cold War duel has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and films. Most notably it inspired the Walter Tevis novel \"The Queen's Gambit,\" which was adapted into the acclaimed Netflix series in 2020.",
      "But at the time, in the wake of his defeat, Spassky fell out of favour.",
      "Four years later, in 1976, he moved to France, after marrying a Frenchwoman of Russian origin. He obtained French citizenship in 1978.",
      "Spassky did not return to the public sphere for years, until he played an unofficial rematch against Fischer in Yugoslavia in 1992.",
      "The last years of his life were marked by ill health and a mysterious family conflict.",
      "After two strokes, he returned to Russia in 2012 with the help of a sponsor and against the advice of his wife and sister.",
      "\"I have to start over from scratch, but I'm not afraid,\" Spassky said on Russian television after his return.",
      "A few years earlier, in 2008, he had visited the grave of his former rival Fischer, who died that year and was buried in a small cemetery in Iceland.",
      "\"Do you think that the neighboring spot is available?\" Spassky asked journalists accompanying him on the visit.",

    "story": [
      "The Hague\u00a0\u2014 A global campaign has led to at least 25 arrests over child sexual abuse content generated by artificial intelligence and distributed online, Europol said Friday.",
      "\"Operation Cumberland has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material, making it exceptionally challenging for investigators due to the lack of national legislation addressing these crimes,\" the Hague-based European police agency said in a statement.",
      "The majority of the arrests were made Wednesday during the world-wide operation led by the Danish police, and which also involved law enforcement agencies from the EU, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. U.S. law enforcement agencies did not take part in the operation, according to Europol.",
      "It followed the arrest last November of the main suspect in the case, a Danish national who ran an online platform where he distributed the AI material he produced.",
      "After a \"symbolic online payment, users from around the world were able to obtain a password to access the platform and watch children being abused,\" Europol said.",
      "Online child sexual exploitation remains one of the most threatening manifestations of cybercrime in the European Union, the agency warned.",
      "It \"continues to be one of the top priorities for law enforcement agencies, which are dealing with an ever-growing volume of illegal content,\" it said, adding that more arrests were expected as the investigation continued.",
      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",
      "Just weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan bill called the \"TAKE IT DOWN Act\" that, if signed into law, would criminalize the \"publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \"deepfake revenge pornography\"), and requires social media and similar websites to implement procedures to remove such content within 48 hours of notice from a victim,\" according to a description on the U.S. Senate website.",
      "As it stands, some social media platforms have appeared unable or unwilling to crackdown on the spread of sexualized, AI-generated deepfake content, including fake images depicting celebrities. In mid-February, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had removed over a dozen fraudulent sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on Facebook.",

In 1988, Congress formally established Red Ribbon Week, which encourages parents, educators and businesses to promote a drug-free lifestyle. The Enrique S.

      "While Pope Francis is certainly far from out of the woods, per Vatican reports, it is important to clarify that mild renal insufficiency simply means blood flow to the kidney is mildly reduced, perhaps from low volume or dehydration, and it might well be improving from the blood transfusions he is receiving.",
      "As long as his urine output keeps up and his kidney function doesn\u2019t worsen, this should not be a major obstacle.",

      "The researchers analyzed blood samples from 42 study participants who experienced symptoms of PVS and 22 who did not.",
      "Those with symptoms were shown to have lower levels of two types of white blood cells. People with PVS who had never had COVID also had lower levels of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, likely because they tended to have fewer vaccine doses, according to the release.",
      "\"Post-vaccination syndrome is real, and has been found [to occur] from many vaccines.\"",
      "\"Fewer vaccine doses and no viral infection means the body\u2019s immune system has had little opportunity to develop a defense to the virus,\" said the researchers.",

      "\"We don\u2019t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with PVS who didn\u2019t have any measurable spike protein \u2014 but it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome,\" said Iwasaki.",
      "People with the syndrome may suffer from excessive fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, insomnia and dizziness, according to the Yale researchers.\u00a0 (iStock)",

      "The rule change allowed student-athletes to profit from their NIL, which was previously prohibited by the NCAA. Walberg and Allen's letter said the expenditure records will \"provide important assistance to Congress in determining whether legislative changes are warranted.\"",
      "\"The Committee is concerned that the Biden-Harris NLRB spent significant taxpayer resources pursuing a case meant to curry favor with union interests for nearly three years,\" the letter states. \"The outcome could have upended intercollegiate athletics and stripped numerous scholarship opportunities from American students.\"",
      "The NLRB's general counsel during the Biden administration, Jennifer Abruzzo, issued a September 2021 memo explaining that the National Labor Relations Act, the nation's primary federal law protecting union organizing, \"fully support[s] the conclusion that certain Players at Academic Institutions are statutory employees.\" The announcement came just a few months after the NCAA began letting students profit from NIL after public pressure and state court cases.",
      "While the change in how college athletes are treated has been welcomed by many, others have been concerned about the move's potential implications. Earlier this month, the Trump administration rescinded the Biden administration NLRB's September 2021 memo insisting college athletes be recognized as employees under federal labor laws.",
      "The Trump administration this month also revoked guidance issued by President Joe Biden on his way out of the White House that required schools to distribute direct NIL payments equally to female and male athletes.",

      "\"Are unions going to step in between a coach and their athletes for yelling at the players, or because practice went long or because they're making them run an exceptional amount of lines?\" Withe wondered. \"If you're represented by a union, they're now your bargaining agent. You have no ability to go represent yourself in anything with the university if it is deemed they are your employer. You've got no ability to go negotiate with them anymore.\"",
      "Withe pointed out that the move could also lead schools to cut sports programs if they are not generating enough revenue, will affect the long-held tradition that meritocracy is the root of athletic competition and increase the financial burden on schools hoping to keep their athletic programs competitive.",
      "\"Public institutions, they're already forking over a cost for the NIL deals. Providing college athletes the same protections as typical employees is just going to increase their tax burden because it's going to be paying players that ordinarily wouldn't be getting paid. Schools are going to be forced to pay those guys, so there's going to be a bigger tax bill associated with it,\" Withe said.",

      "\"Attracting top-tier talent is going to be the hardest thing,\" he added. \"Because you've got a contract among all of your athletes \u2014 let's say, for football or basketball or whatever \u2014 you can't then go and bring in a superstar, a stud quarterback, because you can't pay them the same level that you could without the union. \u2026 Basically, money would sort of have to go over to the bigger revenue-generating sports to compensate everyone equally.\"",
      "The letter from Walberg and Allen added that, under an employee-employer relationship, student-athletes could be forced to start paying federal taxes on any scholarship funds they receive.",

It\u2019s the government's job \u2014 not its burden \u2014 to make sure student athletes' rights are respected and they get their fair share,\" Karla Walter, senior fellow for Inclusive Economy at the Center for American Progress, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Walter added that unionization is viewed favorably among those who don't have the option to be in one.",
      "\"Half of non-union workers say they would join a union if they could, but unionization rates hover around 6% in the private sector,\" she said.",
      "\"Student-athletes generate tens of millions of dollars for their universities,\" said Andrew Stettner, director of economy and jobs at The Century Foundation. \"Just like anyone else whose labor enriches a broader entity, they have a right under the National Labor Relations Act to collectively bargain for things like revenue sharing, workplace conditions and protections from injury,\"",

    "summary": "Just two months into 2025 there have been numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, ranging from infostealers to malicious software.",
    "story": [
      "Jose-Marie Griffiths discusses the increasingly important subject with Fox News Digital.",
      "It's early, but 2025 is not shaping up to be a great year for Mac cybersecurity.",
      "In less than two months, we've seen numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, which are generally considered very secure. These threats range from infostealers to malicious software capable of reading screenshots and stealing passwords.",
      "Now, Microsoft has identified a resurfaced malware that has returned after years, equipped with new malicious capabilities, including stealing sensitive information such as digital wallets and data from the legitimate Notes app.",
      "STAY SAFE & IN THE KNOW \u2013 AT NO COST! SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT FOR FREE SECURITY ALERTS & TECH TIPS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",
      "A person working on their Mac (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAM",
      "What data can it steal?",
      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "5 tips to protect yourself from Mac malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious XCSSET.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protect your Mac from XCSSET and other threats by installing strong antivirus software on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets. The threats are getting smarter and more aggressive, and no platform is off-limits. Staying ahead means taking security seriously, because the bad guys definitely are.",

      "Hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "We saw a rise in infostealer malware in 2024, with hackers using it to steal credentials, cryptocurrency and other personal data from millions of users. If you recall, I reported countless\u00a0incidents of an infostealer called Lumma preying on Android, Windows and even iOS and Mac users.",
      "A new cybersecurity report now highlights that hackers using Lumma, along with StealC, Redline and other infostealers, infected 4.3 million machines in 2024, leading to an astonishing 330 million compromised credentials.",
      "Security researchers have also observed 3.9 billion credentials shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs.",

      "Infostealer-related attacks on the rise in 2024",
      "A\u00a0cybersecurity report by threat intelligence platform KELA has uncovered a sharp rise in infostealer malware in 2024. Researchers also observed an alarming trend in how stolen data was circulated. Large compilations of credentials, often referred to as \"credential lists,\" were being shared across cybercrime forums. These lists, primarily sourced from infostealer logs, contained billions of login details harvested from infected devices.",
      "One of the most notable incidents linked to infostealer malware was the breach of Snowflake, a cloud data storage provider. In April 2024, threat actors gained access to customer accounts using stolen login credentials, many of which were obtained through infostealers. Exploiting weak security practices, such as the absence of multifactor authentication, attackers extracted valuable data and later attempted to sell it on underground markets. The breach affected at least 165 companies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The KELA report highlights that hackers deploying Lumma, StealC, Redline and other infostealers infected 4.3 million machines, leading to the compromise of 330 million credentials. Nearly 40% of these infected machines contained credentials for corporate systems, including content management platforms, email accounts, Active Directory Federation Services and remote desktop environments. In total, this accounted for 1.7 million compromised bots and 7.5 million stolen credentials.",
      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs. KELA\u2019s analysis suggests that almost 65% of infected devices were personal computers storing corporate credentials, making them a prime target for infostealer malware.",

      "2025 is not going to be any different",
      "Infostealer malware is not going anywhere in 2025. With malware-as-a-service platforms on the rise and infostealers becoming more advanced, cybercriminals will likely keep using them as a go-to method for stealing credentials and gaining access to systems.",
      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place. The constant demand for stolen credentials and the ability of cybercriminals to adapt means infostealer attacks will likely remain a major threat in 2025.",

      "Ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

      "Virtual environments provide a calming escape from daily stressors, effectively reducing anxiety in older adults. The immersive experiences offered by VR can also enhance memory function, as nostalgic trips down memory lane stimulate cognitive processes and aid in recall. Perhaps most importantly, engaging in VR activities keeps minds sharp and active, potentially slowing cognitive decline.",

      "I was one of the first to spit into a test tube, giving up my DNA forever to learn more about my health and heredity.\u00a0You know, the ones that promise to connect you with distant relatives you didn\u2019t even know existed or reveal genetic risks for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease. These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health. Even when it comes to ethnicity and ancestry, results usually rely on statistical comparisons to reference populations, which\u00a0don\u2019t necessarily yield accurate results, especially if you\u2019re from a less-studied ethnic group.",

According to an investigative journalist who tried to have her genetic footprint wiped, it was \"brutally difficult.\" Recent events, like 23andMe going bankrupt, highlight just how precarious the situation can be.",
      "Consumers are left worried about what will happen to their genetic data if a testing company is sold or acquired, especially when they have no easy way to retrieve or destroy that data. These companies often don\u2019t disclose where and how your samples are stored, either.",
      "According to Incogni, a data broker removal service, almost none of the DNA testing services it investigated provided any information more substantial than that of a \"secure facility.\" This lack of transparency about where their data is stored and how it can be destroyed creates a major roadblock for anyone trying to regain control over their genetic information.",

      "If you\u2019re still considering using a DNA service, if your genetic information has already been exposed or if you just want to take preventative steps, here are some things to do.",
      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your DNA holds some of the most personal and sensitive information about you, and once it\u2019s out there, you lose control over how it\u2019s used. From potential privacy violations to emotional surprises and the challenges of deleting your genetic data, DNA testing kits come with risks that many don\u2019t recognize upfront. If you\u2019re considering diving into your genetic blueprint, ask yourself: Are you comfortable with this data potentially ending up in the hands of marketers, law enforcement or even a company you didn\u2019t agree to share it with?",

      "Rose Girone, believed to be the oldest living Holocaust survivor and a strong advocate for sharing survivors' stories, has died. She was 113.",

      "\"Rose was an example of fortitude but now we are obligated to carry on in her memory,\" Greg Schneider, Claims Conference executive vice president, said in a statement Thursday. \"The lessons of the Holocaust must not die with those who endured the suffering.\"",
      "Girone was born on January 13, 1912, in Janow, Poland. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany, when she was 6, she said in a filmed interview in 1996 with the USC Shoah Foundation.",
      "When asked by the interviewer if she had any particular career plans before Hitler, she said: \"Hitler came in 1933 and then it was over for everybody.\"",
      "Girone was one of about 245,000 survivors still living across more than 90 countries, according to a study released by the Claims Conference last year. Their numbers are quickly dwindling, as most are very old and often of frail health, with a median age of 86.",
      "Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.",
      "\"This passing reminds us of the urgency of sharing the lessons of the Holocaust while we still have first-hand witnesses with us,\" Schneider said. \"The Holocaust is slipping from memory to history, and its lessons are too important, especially in today\u2019s world, to be forgotten.\"",
      "Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.",

      "The next morning her father-in-law was also taken and she was left alone with their housekeeper.",
      "After her daughter Reha was born in 1938, Girone was able to secure Chinese visas from relatives in London and secure her husband's release.",
      "In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only 6 months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.",
      "Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.",
      "But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three were forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bed bugs crawled through their belongings.",
      "Her father-in-law came just before World War II started but became sick and died. They had to wait in line for food and lived under the rule of a ruthless Japanese man who called himself \"King of the Jews.\"",
      "\"They did really horrible things to people,\" Girone said of the Japanese military trucks that patrolled the streets. \"One of our friends got killed because he wouldn\u2019t move fast enough.\"",
      "Information about the war in Europe only circulated in the form of rumors, as British radios were not allowed.",
      "When the war was over, they began receiving mail from Girone\u2019s mother, grandmother and other relatives in the U.S. With their help, they boarded a ship to San Francisco in 1947 with only $80, which Girone hid inside buttons.",
      "They arrived in New York City in 1947. She later started a knitting store with the help of her mother.",
      "Girone was also reunited with her brother, who went to France for school and ended up getting his U.S. citizenship by joining the Army. When she went to the airport to pick him up in New York, it was her first time seeing him in 17 years.",

    "summary": "The Israeli military&apos;s assessment goes through the years, months and hours leading up to Hamas&apos; brutal surprise attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. This includes intelligence and operational assessments.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on the funeral for the murdered Israeli hostages and the nation\u2019s response.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released most of its investigation of what happened on Oct. 7, 2023, and in the days leading up to Hamas\u2019 massacre. While the initial investigation began in November 2023, outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi ordered all units to start probes in March 2024. The IDF refrained from offering recommendations in its report, saying that those would be left to incoming IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, who will enter the role next week.",

      "OCTOBER 7 HASN'T ENDED. ONE YEAR LATER, 101 HOSTAGES ARE STILL BEING HELD IN GAZA",
      "1. Oct. 7 in numbers",
      "According to the IDF\u2019s assessment, 5,000-5,600 militants infiltrated Israel in three waves. Meanwhile, 4,696 rockets and mortars were fired towards Israel. The attacks left 829 Israeli civilians, 76 foreign nationals and 415 security personnel dead. Additionally, 251 hostages were taken into the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fundamental failure was a result of failure to understand Hamas's intentions and readiness for a wide-scale surprise attack,\" IDF senior officials say in the report.",
      "2. Hamas attack timeline",
      "Hamas\u2019 attacks were not done hastily, according to the IDF, the planning began nearly seven years before the massacre, with the formation of the \"fundamental concept\" in November 2016 and an \"initial plan\" in July 2017. Hamas\u2019 plan was approved in July 2019 and the operational plan was set in August 2021. In early 2022, a readiness committee was established and over the course of the year the terror group evaluated options for implementing its plan.",
      "The IDF says Hamas considered numerous dates for the attacks, including Sept. 16, which was Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Sept. 25, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. Ultimately, Oct. 7, 2023, which coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which marks the end and re-start of the Torah.",
      "This image from video provided by South First Responders shows charred and damaged cars along a desert road after an attack by Hamas terrorists at the Tribe of Nova Trance music festival near Kibbutz Re'im in southern Israel on Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023.\u00a0 (South First Responders via AP)",
      "LOOKING BACK ON THE TIMELINE OF ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS AFTER OCT. 7",
      "3. Full timeline of Oct. 7",
      "The attack, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment began taking shape in the early hours of Oct. 7. Hamas allegedly began preparing its forces around 11:00 p.m. on Oct. 6, after spending much of the day putting them on alert and gathering weapons, and concluded briefings by 4:00 a.m. on Oct. 7.",
      "The infiltration itself began with the first wave at 6:29 a.m. when 1,154 members of Hamas\u2019 Nukhba forces invaded, breaking the security barrier between Gaza and Israel. The IDF declared a state of emergency at 6:43 a.m., and at 7:10 a.m. the Israeli Air Force (IAF) followed suit.",
      "Between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., 3,400 militants were inside Israeli territory. Additionally, just before 8:00 a.m., Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif called on civilians in Gaza to join the attacks. The assessment states that after 9:00 a.m. attackers took advantage of IDF failures and seized opportunities to further the assault. Some allegedly planned to go deeper into Israeli territory.",
      "Several of the \"main attacks\" were stopped by the IDF around 1:00 p.m., but there were still hundreds of attackers in Israel at 3:00 p.m. The IDF says it gained control of some of the communities and surrounding areas by 9:00 p.m., but dozens were present around midnight.",
      "\"We did not predict Hamas would be able to be so brutal in its fighting,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",
      "4. IDF\u2019s incorrect assessment of threats",
      "Much of the IDF\u2019s focus was on Iran and Hezbollah prior to the Oct. 7 attacks, and Hamas was defined as a secondary threat at the time. Additionally, the IDF assumed that it could contain Hamas activity as it worked toward \"gradually improving the existing reality\" with the goal of removing the terror group.",
      "The IDF also believed that \"Hamas didn\u2019t want a full-scale war,\" leading Israel to conclude that a large-scale invasion was unlikely. In the assessment, the IDF says Hamas took advantage of Israel\u2019s perception of the situation and used it to its advantage.",
      "Another major misconception highlighted in the assessment is the IDF\u2019s thinking that the main threat from Hamas were the rockets and mortars being shot from Gaza. This combined with reliance on defense tactics and a barrier, as well as the reduction of troops on the Israel-Gaza border would lead to catastrophe.",
      "5. Intelligence failures",
      "Israel\u2019s Intelligence Directorate did not fully grasp or analyze intel it had on Hamas and its intentions. This apparently also applies to the IDF\u2019s perception of the Shi\u2019ite \"Axis\" and its views on Israel. The IDF says that during the review it found deep-rooted systemic issues with the intelligence directorate and culture.",
      "Since 2018, the Intelligence Directorate had been gathering information on Hamas\u2019 concept for a large-scale attack on Israel. However, the plan was deemed unfeasible and was thought to reflect Hamas\u2019 long-term goals.",
      "In August 2021, intel on Hamas\u2019 military wing described the plan for a large-scale attack on Israeli communities and military outposts surrounding the Gaza Strip. Intelligence officials failed to make the connection between this new intel and what it had gathered in 2018.",
      "The intelligence received in the months leading up to Oct. 7 indicated that Hamas was carrying out training exercises for raids. This apparently changed Israel\u2019s elite Unit 8200\u2019s assessment of the situation, but this was allegedly not communicated with senior leadership.",
      "Israeli soldiers inspect the burnt cars of festival-goers at the site of an attack on the Nova Festival by Hamas gunmen from Gaza, near Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, in southern Israel, Oct. 13, 2023.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Amir Cohen)",
      "ISRAELI ARMY FINDS BODIES OF 3 HOSTAGES IN GAZA KILLED AT OCT. 7 MUSIC FESTIVAL",
      "6. \"Early signs\" missed",
      "In the evening hours of Oct. 6, 2023, Israeli sim cards were activated inside Gaza. However, this was not alerted as it had happened before. Those same sim cards would later allow Hamas militants to communicate after they crossed the border into Israel. There were also indications that night that Hamas leaders were meeting. However, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment, neither of these facts were enough to change the Intelligence Directorate\u2019s way of thinking on Gaza, therefore there was no alert.There were also indications of both usual and unusual Hamas activity that evening. The inquiry revealed that there were intelligence sources that could have been utilized overnight to enhance information that were not used. However, the IDF asserts that had the Intelligence Directive changed its assessment of the situation, there would have been a higher alert for a localized Hamas offensive, but not for an all-out war.",
      "7. Assessment of the IAF",
      "The IAF was found to have met and even exceeded the defined standards for readiness except for two instances due to heavy rocket fire. However, these standards did not align with what would have been required to prepare for a large-scale surprise attack. The IDF concluded that there was \"significant difficulty\" distinguishing IDF troops, civilians and terrorists from one another.",
      "While the IAF struck key Hamas command centers, the IDF admits that even in its review of the strikes it is challenging to determine if there could have been a more effective strike effort given the circumstances.",
      "However, it was noted that the IDF did not prepare for anything like the brutal Oct. 7 massacre.\"We were addicted to the precise intelligence and information we got as commanders and did not consider other scenarios. This failure will forever be etched in our memories, and we will never and should never forget,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "In its conclusion, the IDF notes that the assessment of the situation in Gaza and regarding Hamas was so entrenched in the establishment that there was no deep discussion about alternate possibilities. Additionally, it now says that it was \"incorrect\" to try to \"conflict manage\" Hamas and, in the future, the removal of threats should be prioritized.",
      "The assessment also addresses the possibility of a future attack, saying that a preventative strategy will be key.",

    "summary": "President Trump has shredded America\u2019s defense pact with Europe. Now there are signs that longstanding allies are getting serious about cutting their dependence.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Even before the extraordinary Oval Office bust-up between President Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, relations between Washington and Europe were fraying dramatically.",
      "Now \u2014 after Friday\u2019s diplomatic implosion between Trump, the Ukrainian president and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 it\u2019s not clear what the way back could be for the trans-Atlantic alliance built over the past 80 years.",
      "European leaders lined up to support Zelenskyy in an effective rebuke to Trump, who told his Ukrainian counterpart he was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cgambling with World War III\u201d by defending his country against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201cdignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. \u201cBe strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Zelenskyy. We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, wrote that \u201cwe must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\u201d While French President Emmanuel Macron said it was essential to respect the Ukrainians \u201cfighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe.\u201d",
      "Perhaps most strikingly, European Union foreign minister Kaja Kallas said, \u201cToday it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It\u2019s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.\u201d",
      "Not everyone agreed of course. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban posted that during the \u201cdifficult\u201d Oval Office meeting, Trump \u201cstood bravely for peace.\u201d And other observers faulted Zelenskyy for his part in the exchange, saying he unnecessarily and publicly increased the temperature with a far more senior negotiating partner on which he relies.",
      "But for Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters, these European figures so passionately defend Ukraine because they see it as far more than an internecine conflict raging in the frigid fields of Eastern Europe.",
      "Putin\u2019s invasion is part of a far larger hybrid war, they say, from the Ukrainian battlefield to cyberattacks on Western democracy. They fear that giving the Kremlin a symbolic win in Ukraine may only embolden Russia to expand this assault elsewhere. Doubly so when they accuse Trump of undermining the alliance by barracking its allies and cozying up to Putin, widely reviled in Europe as a war criminal.",
      "This strength of feeling explains why trans-Atlantic relations were splintering before Friday\u2019s undiplomatic scenes. In fact, for the past few weeks, there have been increasing signs that European powers have finally decided to break free from their postwar dependence on the U.S.",
      "\u201cMy absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.,\u201d said Merz after his center-right Christian Democratic Union party won the German election Sunday. He questioned whether NATO\u2019s June summit would still see the alliance \u201cin its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly.\u201d",
      "It was a jaw-dropping statement from a conservative Americanophile, signaling not just a willingness to spend more on defense, a common Trump demand, but a desire to go it alone.",
      "\u201cI never thought I would have to say such a thing on a television program,\u201d he said.",
      "There are myriad uncertainties about how all this might work. Would Europe\u2019s newfound military independence mean spending parity with the U.S. within NATO? Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for example, say they have no desire to reduce their cooperation with Washington. Or would American involvement on the continent diminish or even vanish altogether?",
      "Either way, the scale of the challenge is vast. The U.S. military is so deeply ingrained in Europe that its removal would leave \u201chuge holes\u201d in air defense, military satellites and cyberspace, said Sven Biscop, a director at the Egmont Institute, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Since World War II, the U.S. has agreed to protect Europe\u2019s declining militaries against Russia on the understanding that in return it has been able to spread hard and soft American power through the continent and beyond. Unpicking this symbiosis will take hundreds of billions of dollars, likely footed by European taxpayers already embroiled in a cost-of-living crisis and cuts to public services.",
      "The combined E.U. defense budget of last year, $457 billion, was dwarfed by that of the U.S., $968 billion. Russia\u2019s total, $462 billion, was also larger, despite its far smaller economy, having retooled its entire economy on a war footing since invading Ukraine three years ago.",
      "It will take \u201cfive years as a minimum\u201d for Europe to \u201cfully deter Russia without any U.S. contribution,\u201d said Luigi Scazzieri, assistant director at the Centre for European Reform, a London think tank. \u201cYou can probably get something that fills a large part of the gap in two to three years \u2014 but only with a lot of urgency.\u201d",
      "Regardless of those practical mountains, Merz\u2019s comments showed an \u201cunderstanding that we are in a new era of trans-Atlantic relations,\u201d said Sophia Besch, a senior Europe fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank.",
      "The Trump administration \u201cno longer acknowledges shared community of values, shared interests, and puts forward a very \u2018great power competition\u2019 view of the world, where Europe is a side player and Russia is an equal,\u201d Besch said.",
      "The German leader-apparent is far from alone. He has a fellow traveler in Macron, who for years has argued Europe needs to end its reliance on Washington. \u201cWe are experiencing a historic moment,\u201d he said Monday in response to Merz\u2019s overtures. \u201cIt can lead to an unprecedented Franco-German agreement.\u201d",
      "Biscop believes that these leaders need to form something akin to a European \u201cwar Cabinet\u201d around which to organize this newfound autonomy. Joining them, he believes, should be Britain\u2019s Starmer, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and the E.U.\u2019s von der Leyen.",
      "\u201cThey need agility and they need to move fast,\u201d he said. \u201cEven faster on Ukraine \u2014 because the Americans and Russians are already negotiating.\u201d"

      "A peace deal looks more elusive now than at any point since Trump\u2019s return to power. His meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned dark, with Trump browbeating his counterpart for not being grateful enough for U.S. firepower that helped repel Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Negotiations with Ukraine appear to have collapsed for now, jeopardizing Trump\u2019s pledge to bring a quick end to the war \u2014 and perhaps spoiling his best shot at winning an award that has been on his mind for years.",
      "Four American presidents have won the Nobel Peace Prize, none named Trump. That missing piece of the resume grates on him, former aides say, as was evident during his meeting in the Oval Office last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cThey will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Trump said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about the award. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me.\u201d",
      "If not, it won\u2019t be for lack of trying.",
      "In the space of a few days last week, no fewer than three senior Trump administration officials or nominees made a case for Trump winning the prize, using similar talking points.",
      "Unprompted, both Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Rep. Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican nominated to be ambassador to the United Nations, told conservative activists that Trump is a president \u201cof peace\u201d who deserves the award.",
      "\u201cHe is going to end the war in Europe. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East,\u201d Waltz told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "\u201cAnd you know what?\u201d he added. \u201cBy the end of this, we\u2019re going to have the Nobel Peace Prize sitting next to the name of Donald J. Trump.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also mentioned the prize during an interview with Fox News. Without prompting, Bessent said Trump\u2019s plan to end the conflict between Ukraine and Russia merits the honor. If \u201cfairly awarded,\u201d he added, \u201cI think in a year he should get it from what I\u2019ve seen.\u201d",
      "The odds are tough and may hinge on the particulars of a truce between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 if there is one.",
      "Fears have risen in recent weeks that Trump will use his leverage to end the war on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s terms. His rhetoric has grown discernibly more hostile to Ukraine.",
      "Even before the angry meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, he called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and suggested that Ukraine instigated the war.",
      "Now, Trump\u2019s anger has spilled into public view. As Zelenskyy sat with arms folded, Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded him like they would a disobedient schoolboy.",
      "\u201cHave you said \u2018thank you\u2019 once in this entire meeting?\u201d Vance said to Zelenskyy.",
      "In a testy tone, Trump told the Ukrainian leader, \u201cYou\u2019re either going to make a deal or we\u2019re out. And if we\u2019re out, you\u2019ll fight it out. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be pretty, but you\u2019ll fight it out. But you don\u2019t have the cards.\u201d",
      "At one point, Trump suggested he had bonded with Putin during his first term over what he called a \u201cphony witch hunt\u201d involving investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "\u201cLet me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Afterward, the White House canceled a side-by-side news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, who was told to leave the building. He\u2019s not welcome back, Trump later said in a statement, until he is \u201cready for Peace\u201d",
      "If Trump forges an agreement that\u2019s favorable to Russia while leaving the rest of Europe vulnerable to Putin\u2019s aggression, that might sour any prospect of winning the prize. A pro-Russia deal may not sit well with the Nobel selection committee, whose five members are appointed by the Norwegian parliament.",
      "\u201cIn Norway, we are bordering on Russia. This is very tough for all of us, because we are the ones who will be in jeopardy if Russia keeps on taking territory,\u201d said Tybring-Gjedde, a member of Norway\u2019s parliament serving on the defense and foreign affairs committees.",
      "The National Security Council did not return a request for comment for this article.",
      "\u2018They probably will never give it to me\u2019",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize became a running subplot of Trump\u2019s first term. At times he sounded captivated by the award.",
      "At a future farmers event in Indianapolis in 2018, Trump mentioned a previous American winner who had died nine years earlier, Norman Borlaug, a plant scientist who had helped combat global famine.",
      "While praising Borlaug, he said: \u201cCan you believe it?\u00a0He won the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey probably will never give it to me, even what I\u2019m doing in Korea, and in Idlib province and all of these places,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThey probably will never give it to me.\u00a0You know why?\u00a0Because they don\u2019t want to.\u201d",
      "Trump had two real shots at winning one back then: his efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons (that didn\u2019t happen) and to normalize relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors (that one did).",
      "In September 2020, Tybring-Gjedde nominated him for the Middle East peace deal known as the Abraham Accords, though when the winners were announced the following year, Trump was skunked.",
      "Co-winners Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov were journalists who had exposed abuses of power in the Philippines and Russia, respectively.",
      "Even the nomination was something the White House chose to celebrate. The White House press office released a statement drawing attention it. Campaigning for re-election in Ohio that month, Trump complained that the press hadn\u2019t paid enough to attention to the nomination, though having one\u2019s name put forward isn\u2019t necessarily a rare distinction.",
      "The list of people allowed to nominate someone is long. Quite long.",
      "Any member of a national legislature can put someone\u2019s name before the selection committee. (Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., nominated Trump last year). So can Cabinet ministers and heads of state (Japan\u2019s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated Trump for the 2019 prize). And university professors. And retired university professors. And someone serving on the board of directors of an organization that once won the prize. And anyone who advised the Nobel Committee in the past.",
      "Since Trump ran his first winning presidential campaign in 2016, an average of 323 people or groups a year have been nominated for the prize. That\u2019s enough to fill the rosters of six NFL teams.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. One topic they discussed was whether Trump would impose tariffs on Britain.",
      "If Starmer wants to ingratiate himself with Trump, there\u2019s an easy way to do it, said John Bolton, the White House national security adviser in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cPeople say, \u2018What would you recommend Starmer do?\u2019 and I said I would recommend that he nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Bolton said in an interview.",
      "Trump, he added, \u201cis definitely obsessed with it.\u201d",
      "A look at some previous winners suggests that Trump would be something of an anomaly if he\u2019s chosen. He\u2019s out of step with a few of the past winners.",
      "In 2012, the prize went to the European Union. At his first Cabinet meeting, held this week, Trump said he\u2019d soon be placing a 25% tariff on goods from the E.U., an institution he said was \u201cformed in order to screw the United States.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s allies say he has reason to be peeved. The last president to win the award was Barack Obama, who got it just nine months into his presidency, before he had notched any real achievements. Even Obama acknowledged in his acceptance speech that his accomplishments were \u201cslight.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the fair question to ask is, would Barack Obama have won for helping bring an end to the war\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, Mick Mulvaney, a former Trump White House chief of staff, said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think we all know the answer to that question.\u201d",
      "The makeup of the Nobel selection committee could impede whatever chance Trump might have. Winners aren\u2019t chosen based on isolated actions. A candidate\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d also comes into play.",
      "\u201cI will only remind you that any candidate for any Nobel Prize must have given a contribution to the greatest benefit of humankind,\u201d Berit Reiss-Andersen, a former chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told NBC News.",
      "The committee\u2019s new chairman, J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, is also secretary-general of PEN Norway, a group whose mission includes supporting free expression and \u201cwriters at risk.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not the career path of a MAGA enthusiast. Trump has faced criticism over his treatment of U.S. journalists on free speech grounds. One of his early actions has been to bar The Associated Press wire service from Air Force One and certain events in which only a small group of \u201cpool\u201d reporters are allowed to watch and ask questions.",

      "Elite recognition",
      "Why would Trump care about the prize? He rode to power as a populist who disdains the elite. Yet the Nobel Peace Prize brims with elite validation.",
      "That\u2019s the duality. Trump may be allied with the MAGA movement, but some part of him seems to pine for elite recognition. He often mentions an uncle who taught at the prestigious MIT. When Pete Hegseth struggled to win Senate confirmation, Trump vouched for him in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d by mentioning that Hegseth had gone to Ivy League schools.",
      "But envy may play a role, as well. Obama\u2019s prize was a sore point for Trump, said Bolton and another former senior White House official from the first term.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration continued to face setbacks in court this week over its efforts to drastically downsize the size of the government, while plaintiffs in some of the cases accused the government of trying to sidestep judicial orders.",
      "A federal judge in California found a U.S. Office of Personnel Management memo that directed the firing of thousands of probationary employees was unlawful and should be rescinded, while another in Washington, D.C. ordered the restoration of foreign aid that was supposed to be freed weeks ago.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 and the judge \u2014 in the foreign aid case have accused the government of continued stonewalling, while plaintiffs in cases involving the suspension of refugee program funding charged the administration is failing to fully comply with court orders.",
      "Here's a look at the swirl of legal developments over the past week.",
      "Mass firings of probationary workers 'illegal'",
      "A federal judge in California on Thursday ordered OPM to rescind a memo and email telling agencies to get rid of probationary employees.  The directions, communicated in a Jan. 20\u00a0memo\u00a0and Feb. 14 internal email, are \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cshould be stopped, rescinded,\u201d Judge William Alsup said.",
      "\u201cThe Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees within another agency,\u201d the judge found. \u201cIt can hire its own employees, yes. Can fire them. But it cannot order or direct some other agency to do so,\u201d Alsup said.",
      "His ruling did not reinstate the thousands of employees who have already been dismissed, but it came ahead of expected terminations at the Defense Department Friday of probationary employees \u2014largely workers who've been in a job for less than two years.",
      "'Death, impoverishment, sickness, and waste'",
      "On Tuesday, a D.C. federal judge ordered for the third time the government to comply with his Feb. 13 order blocking a blanket freeze on foreign aid by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The frustrated judge also went a step farther, ordering them to free the funding by midnight Wednesday after a lawyer for the Justice Department couldn't tell him what steps they'd taken to comply with his order.",
      "The government then said for the first time in a filing the next day that it would take \"weeks\" to unfreeze the money, and appealed to a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0for a stay of the deadline. The appeals court rejected the government's bid, and the government then turned to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts issued a stay.",
      "The plaintiffs on Friday asked the high court to reject the appeal, and said the government had gone to the court \"with an emergency of its own making.\"",
      "In court filings in the underlying case, the government argued it's now in compliance with the order because all of the 12,000 grants and awards have since undergone individual reviews and Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u201chas now made a final decision with respect to each award, on an individualized basis, affirmatively electing to either retain the award or terminate it.\u201d The filing said over 10,000 of the awards have been terminated.",
      "The plaintiffs argue those terminations are unlawful \u2014 and the delays have been catastrophic in more ways than one.",
      "\"There is no dispute whatsoever that Defendants\u2019 actions have led to death, impoverishment, sickness, and waste\" around the world, they wrote, and they \"do not address the thousands of American jobs \u2014 and counting \u2014 that have been lost as a direct result of the blanket freeze.\"",
      "Refugee admission 'antics'",
      "A federal judge in Seattle on Tuesday blocked Trump\u2019s executive order pausing\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, agreeing with the plaintiffs' arguments that the order likely exceeded the president\u2019s authority.",
      "\u201cThe president has substantial discretion to suspend refugee admissions. But that authority is not limitless,\u201d U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead said in his decision. \u201cHe cannot ignore Congress\u2019 detailed framework for refugee admissions and the limits it places on the president\u2019s ability to suspend the same.\u201d",
      "Whitehead said he would issue a written decision in the coming days, and on Thursday, the aid groups that had filed the suit said the government was trying to circumvent his impending decision by formally deciding to terminate their refugee assistance contracts. They've asked for an emergency hearing to \"ensure that Defendants are not permitted to evade this Court's bench ruling and forthcoming written order with antics designed to confuse the state of play.\"",
      "The government is being sued in a separate but similar case by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which was also seeking a restraining order. They say the suspension has prevented the organization \"from receiving the funds necessary to carry out its mission to assist the refugees the government already placed in its care.\"",
      "On Thursday, the government filed \"a notice of change of material facts,\" informing the judge that USCCB's contract had been terminated, so its claim should now be considered a contract dispute that should be heard in the Court of Federal Claims. Joseph Carilli, a lawyer for the government, doubled down on that stance at a hearing on Friday. \u201cThis harm is about money, they want reimbursement. This is about money,\u201d he said.",
      "The organization said it's about its mission, and contended the judge should still take action. \"The government cannot escape review of its unlawful suspension by effecting an unlawful termination,\" it said in a filing.",
      "More DOGE restrictions",
      "A federal judge in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order barring OPM and the\u00a0Department of Education from allowing personnel with Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency from accessing records with sensitive personal information.",
      "The order by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman follows a similar ruling last week barring DOGE from access to records at the Treasury Department.",
      "Boardman found that the plaintiffs in the case, which include members of several major unions, had shown that the Education Department and OPM \u201clikely violated the Privacy Act by disclosing their personal information to DOGE affiliates without their consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cDOGE affiliates have been granted access to systems of record that contain some of the plaintiffs\u2019 most sensitive data \u2014 Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, income and assets, citizenship status, and disability status \u2014 and their access to this trove of personal information is ongoing,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThere is no reason to believe their access to this information will end anytime soon because the government believes their access is appropriate.\u201d",
      "In a separate case involving DOGE's access to Labor Department data, a federal judge in D.C. ordered a DOGE official to provide documents and testify under oath about the office's operations, which the judge described as \"opaque.\"",
      "ICE banned from some houses of worship",
      "In Maryland, a federal judge issued an order restricting immigration raids at or near houses of worship owned by a group of religious organizations that filed suit challenging a new policy allowing such raids.",
      "The previous policy, which had been in effect since the early 1990s, had protected \u201csensitive locations\u201d such as churches from immigration enforcement without special approval.",
      "The order by U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang of Maryland only applies to the religious organizations that filed the suit.",
      "Injunction on federal funding freeze",
      "On Tuesday, a federal judge in Washington issued a preliminary injunction barring the administration from reinstating a federal funding freeze directed by the Office of Management and Budget that had caused chaos and confusion across the country.",
      "\u201cMany organizations had to resort to desperate measures just to stay operational,\u201d Judge Loren AliKhan wrote in her order. \u201cThe pause placed critical programs for children, the elderly, and everyone in between in serious jeopardy. Because the public\u2019s interest in not having trillions of dollars arbitrarily frozen cannot be overstated, Plaintiffs have more than met their burden here,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The OMB directive was later rescinded, but the White House added to the confusion by then saying it was \"NOT a rescission\u00a0of the federal funding freeze.\"",
      "AliKhan and a federal judge in Rhode Island both issued restraining orders blocking the freeze from going back into effect. The Rhode Island judge, John J. McConnell, has yet to rule on a motion for a preliminary injunction in that case.",
      "Second appeals court loss on Trump birthright citizenship order",
      "For the second time in a week, a panel of federal appeals court judges handed a loss to the Justice Department's attempts to implement President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order\u00a0limiting birthright citizenship.",
      "The government had sought a stay of a lower court's ruling barring the order from going into effect while it appeals.",
      "The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied that bid in a ruling Friday. \"We join the Ninth Circuit in finding that the government has not made a 'strong showing' that it is 'likely to succeed on the merits' of its argument,\" the three-judge panel's ruling said.",
      "Trump\u2019s order aims to limit birthright citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a United States citizen or permanent resident. At least three judges have\u00a0blocked\u00a0the directive, finding it violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution."

    "story": [
      "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, announced Saturday that he\u2019s running to be the next mayor of New York City.",
      "Cuomo had been teasing a campaign launch for weeks and is now jumping back into politics just four years after he resigned from the governorship following multiple sexual harassment allegations.",
      "\u201cWe know that the first step towards solving a problem is having the strength, having the courage to recognize it, and we know that today, our New York City is in trouble,\u201d Cuomo said in a nearly 18-minute campaign launch video posted on X.",
      "\u201cBut New Yorkers know the simple answer of what to do when there\u2019s a crisis in leadership. You lead, you act, you do,\u201d the former governor added.",
      "He also ran through a list of accomplishments from his time as governor, telling viewers, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do these things because they were easy. They weren\u2019t. They were hard, but they were necessary, and today it is necessary to launch a bold action plan to turn New York City around, to save our city.\u201d",
      "Cuomo\u2019s campaign launch comes as Mayor Eric Adams, also a Democrat, has been embroiled in scandal for months following a federal indictment on corruption charges.",
      "The case against Adams is stalled as the Justice Department, led by President Donald Trump\u2019s political appointees, seek to dismiss the charges.",
      "A handful of other Democratic candidates \u2014 including city Comptroller Brad Lander, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, state Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani\u00a0and state Sens. Jessica Ramos and Zellnor Myrie\u00a0\u2014 are also running ahead of the June 24 primary, challenging Adams\u2019 path to a second term.",
      "In a statement minutes after Cuomo launched his campaign, Stringer blasted the former governor, saying that Cuomo \u201cspent years treating New York City like his personal punching bag \u2014 slashing MTA funding and wrecking the subway while funneling money to upstate ski resorts, and trying to cut billions in funding for public school kids and Medicaid for city residents. And now he wants New Yorkers to rehabilitate his reputation? Give me a break.\u201d",
      "Before he resigned in 2021, the former governor enjoyed high approval ratings, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as he gave near-daily briefings to New Yorkers and appeared often on CNN while his brother, Chris Cuomo, was an anchor there.",
      "But as allegations of sexual harassment, including by nine state employees, surfaced, Cuomo faced bipartisan calls to step down.",
      "A 2021 report written by state Attorney General Letitia James alleged that Cuomo had harassed 11 women and subjected some of them to uninvited touching and groping.",
      "In his resignation speech, Cuomo told New Yorkers, \u201cIn my mind, I\u2019ve never crossed the line with anyone, but I didn\u2019t realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn. There are generational and cultural shifts that I just didn\u2019t fully appreciate.\u201d",
      "He also said at the time that he stepped down not because of the allegations, but because \u201cwasting energy on distraction is the last thing government should be.\u201d",
      "In his campaign launch video on Saturday, Cuomo seemed to nod to the past allegations against him, saying, \u201cDid I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not. Would I do some things differently, knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully, definitely, and I believe I learned from them, and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show you that every day.\u201d",
      "Before he even launched his campaign on Saturday, Cuomo had already earned the endorsement of Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., who told the New York Post on Monday that \u201cAndrew Cuomo has the competence to govern the city. He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics \u2014 both from the far left and far right.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmerica loves a comeback, New York loves a comeback,\u201d Torres added.",
      "Cuomo held his first campaign event on Saturday at a Dominican restaurant in the Bronx. At the event, he received the endorsement of New York Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia, whose district includes parts of the Bronx.",
      "\u201cAll too often the needs of my constituents are ignored. That wasn\u2019t the case when Andrew Cuomo was Governor,\u201d Tapia said in a statement. \u201cHe passed historic legislation to raise the minimum wage, protect tenants, and keep our streets safe.\u201d"

      "The flyers that arrived in this town 7 miles from Windsor Castle are the latest threat directed at Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy diaspora, who have fled the city trying to escape the long arm of Chinese law, only to find that harassment can cross borders.",

      "\u201cThe bounty is because they want to silence us and they want to instill fear among our diaspora,\u201d said Lau, who fled Hong Kong in 2021 after the former British colony enacted a sweeping and vaguely worded national security law that gave the government more power to quash dissent.",
      "The law followed a political crackdown triggered by Hong Kong\u2019s 2019 pro-democracy protests. It threatens stringent penalties for a wide range of actions authorities call threats to national security, with the most severe \u2014 including treason and insurrection \u2014 punishable by life imprisonment. Lesser offenses, including the possession of seditious publications, could also lead to several years in jail.",
      "Lau was declared a criminal by police after she fled Hong Kong. The city\u2019s police placed the bounty on her after accusing her of violating the national security law and calling for her return.",

In September, the Hong Kong Journalists Association said people from dozens of media outlets had received threatening messages in a \u201csystematic and organized\u201d campaign, calling it the largest-scale harassment of reporters it had ever seen.",
      "This is not the first time concerns have been raised about the safety of Hong Kong democracy activists living in Britain, which took in more than 120,000 people from its former colony in response to the national security law.",

      "The robotic lander, dubbed Blue Ghost, has been in orbit around the moon for roughly two weeks, preparing for its daring descent. Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace developed the spacecraft, which aims to touch down on the lunar surface early Sunday at around 3:34 a.m. ET.",
      "If all goes according to plan, Blue Ghost will become the second privately built vehicle to land on the moon successfully. In February 2024, another Texas-based company, Intuitive Machines, made history when its Odysseus lander pulled off a nail-biting touchdown near the moon\u2019s south pole.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s upcoming landing attempt is the first in a flurry of robotic missions to the moon in 2025. Earlier this week, Intuitive Machines launched its second lander into space, with a targeted moon landing on or around March 6. And a lander and tiny rover developed by Japanese company ispace launched to the moon on the same rocket as Blue Ghost, but are taking a longer, less energy-intensive path and are expected to arrive in late May or early June.",
      "Blue Ghost aims to touch down in a 350-mile-wide basin on the near side of the moon (the side that always faces Earth). The region is thought to be the site of an ancient asteroid impact, according to NASA.",

      "Blue Ghost is expected to begin its hourlong descent to the moon a little after 2 a.m. ET on Sunday. NASA will broadcast a livestream beginning at 2:20 a.m. ET on NASA TV.",
      "The spacecraft is carrying 10 NASA science instruments, including one that will probe the interior of the moon to depths of up to 700 miles. Cameras will snap X-ray images looking back at Earth, studying how space weather interacts with Earth\u2019s magnetic field, while a separate camera will take detailed photos of the lander as it descends to the lunar surface in order to aid future missions to the moon.",
      "Instruments aboard the lander will also analyze samples of lunar soil, study how much lunar dust sticks to different materials, and  use lasers to measure the precise distance between Earth and the moon.",
      "Blue Ghost is expected to spend about two weeks gathering data on the lunar surface.",
      "The mission is part of NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative, which was set up as a public-private partnership between the agency and more than a dozen U.S. companies to deliver NASA science experiments, technology and other cargo to the moon. It's a component of NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to eventually\u00a0return humans to the moon.",

      "The troopers found Michelle Zajko, then 30, and brought her to their barracks for questioning. But she refused to cooperate and was allowed to leave, according to a law enforcement affidavit.",
      "Then something strange happened.",
      "Troopers told Zajko to wait in the lobby so they could return her car. She bolted instead, leaving behind her vehicle and $40,000 in cash that was found inside of it, according to the affidavit.",
      "The murder case went cold for the next two years. But it gained renewed attention in January after prosecutors linked a person of interest in the killing, now known to be Zajko, to other suspects in violent crimes in California and Vermont \u2014 people who are members of a cultlike group of highly educated, AI-obsessed vegans known as the Zizians.",
      "Zajko\u2019s whereabouts had remained a mystery after she fled the state police barracks. But last month, she and two associates who had also been questioned in the killing of her parents were arrested in Maryland on trespassing and weapons charges.",
      "The trio were ordered to remain behind bars after a prosecutor said in court that they were part of a group \u201ctied to multiple homicides that have occurred across the United States.\u201d",
      "Neither Zajko nor anyone else has been charged in her parents\u2019 murder, but family and friends say they now have hope for the first time that there will be a break in the case.",
      "\u201cHopefully, there will finally be justice for Rich and Rita,\u201d said a family friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "A bright future",
      "The Zajkos lived in a neighborhood of stately homes and well-landscaped lawns located about 30 miles west of Philadelphia.",
      "Michelle was their only child. She was adopted as a baby and raised at the home in Chester Heights.",
      "She went on to study biology at the now-defunct Cabrini University in Pennsylvania before earning a master's degree in bioinformatics at Temple University, according to her LinkedIn page.",
      "She was a high-achieving student with lofty goals. Michelle Zajko worked as a research intern at the esteemed Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. She also interned at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California, studying how spaceflight stresses the human body.",
      "\u201cI want to help save people for my career,\u201d she told the Cabrini University student newspaper.",
      "Her parents owned several rental units in a development in the nearby town of Aston. In the years before the killings, Richard Zajko spent much of his time checking in on their tenants and fixing whatever needed to be fixed, two of the tenants said in interviews.",
      "\u201cIf there was an issue, he was Johnny on the spot,\u201d said one who asked to remain anonymous.",
      "But Richard Zajko wasn\u2019t just a responsive landlord. He charged his tenants far less than other units went for and repeatedly encouraged them to save enough so that they could buy their own homes, according to the two former tenants.",
      "\u201cHe genuinely cared about people,\u201d said the other tenant, who also asked to remain anonymous.",
      "When he found out a couple renting one of his apartments was having a baby, Zajko lit up. He talked about how thrilled he and his wife were when they adopted their daughter.",
      "Michelle was in her late 20s by then and had left home long ago. But Zajko made an offer to the tenants that left them stunned: Would they like to have Michelle\u2019s baby clothes?",
      "A shocking crime",
      "Investigators determined that the Zajkos were killed on Dec. 31, 2022 \u2014\u00a0the same day Michelle turned 30.",
      "Rita, 69, had a gunshot wound to the back of her head, her autopsy found. Richard, 71, had taken a bullet to his right hand and another to his right temple, according to his autopsy.",
      "Their bodies were discovered in an upstairs bedroom. No gun was found at the scene, according to court records, but there were two 9 mm shell casings \u2014\u00a0each bearing a stamped impression of \u201c9mm Luger +P SIG.\u201d",
      "Three days later, investigators with the Vermont and Pennsylvania state police traveled to Michelle Zajko\u2019s home in Coventry, Vermont, a remote town about 20 miles south of the Canadian border. Zajko confirmed to the investigators that she owned a firearm \u2014 a semiautomatic handgun that fires 9 mm-type ammunition, according to court records.",
      "She allowed the investigators to hold the gun, but they didn\u2019t have a warrant to seize it.",
      "\u201cIn handling and observing said firearm, it was found to be free of dust, dirt or debris \u2014 appearing to be well kept and recently cleaned and/or serviced,\u201d a Vermont State Police search warrant affidavit said.",
      "Zajko told troopers that she was in Vermont in the days before and after New Year\u2019s Eve, the affidavit says, and that she had not spoken to her parents since January 2022.",
      "The investigators later learned that Zajko had purchased the gun at a local sporting goods store, along with a box of ammunition of the same manufacture and type as the spent casings found at the murder scene in Pennsylvania, the affidavit says.",
      "They sought a search warrant for the gun and ammunition that they believed was still inside Zajko\u2019s home. But on the same day it was filed, Jan. 12, 2023, Zajko was actually in Pennsylvania for her parents\u2019 funeral. That\u2019s when Pennsylvania state troopers, carrying a separate search warrant, went to the Candlewood Suites hotel in pursuit of Zajko and her gun.",
      "There was no gun or ammunition inside Zajko\u2019s hotel room. But after she allegedly bolted from the Pennsylvania State Police barracks, troopers returned to the hotel and found the gun in a room where two of her associates were staying, the Vermont state police affidavit says.",
      "The investigators tried to reach Zajko again but had no luck. She was, at that point, in the wind.",
      "Six deaths in three states",
      "Two years passed with no developments in the case. Then on Jan. 20 of this year, a Border Patrol agent, David Maland, was killed in a gunbattle in northern Vermont. The shooting broke out after Maland and other agents pulled over a car that was occupied by two people \u2014 Ophelia Bauckholt and Teresa Youngblut.",
      "Federal prosecutors say Youngblut opened fire after she got out of the car, prompting at least one agent to shoot back. Bauckholt was fatally shot as she drew a gun, prosecutors say, and Youngblut was also shot but survived."

      "The pair were found dead at their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home  Wednesday. Hackman likely died more than a week earlier \u2014\u00a0on Feb. 17, the last day his pacemaker recorded an \u201cevent,\" Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said at a Friday news conference.",
      "\u201cI think that is a very good assumption, that that was his last day of life,\u201d Mendoza said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning, Mendoza said, but added that the pathologist would be the one to rule out the poisonous gas as the cause of death.",
      "He also said it was likely neither Hackman nor Arakawa had a fatal fall, because there was \"no trauma indicated on the body,\" he said Friday.",
      "Investigators have called the deaths \"suspicious\" as they found no obvious signs of a gas leak, no signs of foul play, and nothing out of place at the sprawling property. Adding to the mystery was that one dog, a German Shepherd, was found dead and two other dogs were found alive on the property.",

The deputy suspected Hackman may have suddenly fallen.",

    "story": [
      "JOLIET, Ill. \u2014\u00a0An Illinois man was found guilty Friday in the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy and the wounding of his mother, an attack that prosecutors said was motivated by anti-Muslim hate, just days after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "Joseph Czuba was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated battery and hate crimes in the Oct. 14, 2023, killing of Wadee Alfayoumi, who was stabbed 26 times, and in the wounding of his mother, Hanan Shaheen, who was stabbed more than a dozen times in suburban Chicago.",
      "The jury deliberated for just over an hour.",
      "The mother and son rented two rooms from Czuba and his then-wife in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles southwest of downtown Chicago, where the attack took place.",
      "Shaheen, 33, testified that Czuba, 73, turned on her shortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. She said he and his then-wife were aware that she is Muslim and of Palestinian descent before they agreed to rent the rooms to her, and that she didn\u2019t have any issues in the two years she rented from them. She was the prosecution\u2019s first witness.",
      "Shaheen and Czuba\u2019s ex-wife, Mary Connor, who also testified for the prosecution, said that in the week leading up to the stabbings, Czuba was outraged about the war between Israel and Hamas. Shaheen said he began speaking hatefully about Muslims. Shaheen testified that Czuba told her \u201cyour people\u201d are killing Jewish people and babies in Israel, that Muslims were not welcome in his home and that she needed to move out.",
      "\u201cI told him, \u2018Pray for peace,\u2019\u201d Shaheen testified.",
      "Days later, Shaheen said, Czuba forced his way into her room, held her down, stabbed her with a knife and tried to break her teeth, as her son, Wadee, watched in fear. At one point, she said, she was able to get ahold of the knife and stab Czuba before he seized it from her.",
      "She said that when she went into a bathroom to call 911, Czuba moved on to Wadee, who had just celebrated his birthday. She said she could hear him shouting, \u201cOh no, stop!\u201d",
      "A knife with a 7-inch blade, which prosecutors held up to show jurors multiple times during closing arguments, was still lodged in Wadee\u2019s body when first responders arrived and was later removed. Shaheen was hospitalized and received 19 stitches on her face, as well as staples on the back of her head.",
      "The killing of Wadee and the attack on Shaheen drew international attention and left many people in Illinois\u2019 large Muslim and Palestinian communities frightened. Heena Musabji, legal director at the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Friday it \u201cis the most heinous of hate crimes to impact Chicago\u2019s Muslim community in recent history.\u201d",
      "Czuba, who did not testify at his trial, will be sentenced May 2.",
      "In court documents, prosecutors said he became obsessed with the war in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThis happened because this defendant was afraid that a war that had started on Oct. 7, 2023, a half a world away in the Middle East, was going to come to his doorstep,\u201d\u00a0Prosecutor Michael Fitzgerald, a Will County assistant state\u2019s attorney, told jurors in his opening statement. \u201cThis happened because Hanan and Wadee were Muslim.\u201d",
      "Connor, the ex-wife, testified that Czuba had become paranoid about his personal safety and believed that their lives might be in danger because of Shaheen. She said that they both had a good relationship with Shaheen, whom she said she considered a friend and good tenant. Czuba tried to make the home enjoyable and would sometimes bring home toys for Wadee, she said. Days after the Hamas attack, Czuba became withdrawn and told her that he wanted Shaheen to move out of their home, she said.",
      "\u201cHanan needs to move because her friends could come and do us harm,\u201d Connor testified Czuba had told her.",
      "But Connor, who was married to Czuba for 30 years, said she disagreed. She believed they should adhere to the terms of Shaheen\u2019s lease, and give her 30 days notice to move, and told Czuba that Shaheen had never had a guest in the home.",
      "\u201cI was angry,\u201d Connor testified. \u201cIn my mind, there was no reason for her to move.\u201d",
      "She said Czuba also talked of an upcoming \u201cday of jihad\u201d and withdrew $1,000 from his bank account because of fears the U.S. banking system would fail.",
      "Prosecutors played for jurors a conversation between Czuba and a Will County sheriff\u2019s sergeant, in which Czuba compared Wadee and Shaheen to \u201cinfested rats.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat do you do when you have an infested rat situation? You exterminate them. And that\u2019s what he did that day,\u201d prosecutor Chris Koch said in his closing argument Friday. \u201cThat was his thought process.\u201d",
      "In his closing argument, George Lenard, one of Czuba\u2019s attorneys, invoked O.J. Simpson\u2019s trial attorney Johnnie Cochran, telling jurors that there had been a rush to judgment in Czuba\u2019s case.",
      "Lenard also questioned why Shaheen retreated to the bathroom, the location of some of her wounds and the evidence from the scene, and he appeared to suggest that Shaheen had a financial interest in the case, something he tried to question her about under cross-examination. Shaheen filed a wrongful death suit against Czuba and his ex-wife that is still pending.",
      "\u201cYou know this is a half-baked case that the prosecution is giving you,\u201d he said.",
      "He urged the jurors to \u201chave the courage\u201d to find Czuba not guilty.",
      "Prosecutor Christine Vukmir rebutted his argument, calling the suggestion that Shaheen stabbed Wadee and then framed Czuba \u201coutlandish.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is the plot that he is presenting to you,\u201d she told jurors. \u201cIt is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Czuba was found on the ground outside when deputies arrived at the house.",
      "Jurors heard from police officers, firefighters and other first responders, as well as from a physician assistant who treated Shaheen at a hospital. They also heard Shaheen\u2019s 911 call to police, in which Wadee\u2019s cries could be heard and she repeatedly told the dispatcher, \u201cHe is killing my baby.\u201d",
      "One of the Will County sheriff\u2019s deputies who found Wadee\u2019s body cried on the stand as jurors watched footage from her body-worn camera. Some of the footage and images were so graphic during the trial that\u00a0Judge Amy Bertani-Tomczak granted a defense request that the courtroom television monitor be turned away from the gallery, where members of Wadee\u2019s family sat during the trial, so that only the jurors could see it.",
      "Wadee\u2019s father,\u00a0Odai Alfayoumi, said at the Will County courthouse in Joliet that he felt \u201clike this decision came a little too late.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be pleased or upset, if I should be crying or laughing,\u201d he said in Arabic through a translator. \u201cPeople are telling me to smile. Maybe if I were one of you, I would be smiling. But I\u2019m the father of the child, and I\u2019ve lost a child.\u201d",
      "\u201cI pray that this loss, this senseless loss, is the last that we will see, that no child would suffer what my beloved little Wadee had to go through,\u201d he continued.",
      "Ahmed Rehab, the executive director of CAIR Chicago, who translated his remarks, said Shaheen was not present when the verdict was announced because it was too difficult, but she wanted him to relay that she prays only for peace and love.",
      "Selina Guevara reported from Joliet, Ill., and Janelle Griffith from New York."

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:00:29 GMT",
    "summary": "For director Brady Corbet, bringing \"The Brutalist\" to life was a family affair. He and his life partner, Mona Fastvold, who co-wrote the screenplay, are both up for Oscars.",
    "story": [
      "It was a rare wholesome moment at what\u2019s typically known as Hollywood\u2019s biggest and booziest party.",
      "Brady Corbet, accepting a Golden Globe last month for directing \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d made it clear just how important his family was to the making of the epic film. As he spoke, the camera cut to three women who helped Corbet build it: \u201cthe incomparable\u201d Mary Corbet, who raised him as a single mother; Mona Fastvold, his longtime \u201cmuse\u201d and co-writer of the film; and 10-year-old Ada, Corbet and Fastvold\u2019s child.",
      "\u201cI love you so much, Ada James,\u201d Corbet said, looking toward his daughter as she cried tears of joy and relief.",
      "After all, the movie has been part of her life in one way or another since she was 3 years old, Corbet and Fastvold told NBC News in a recent interview at the Breuer Building on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. The brutalist-style structure, designed by the Hungarian-German modernist architect Marcel Breuer and completed in 1966 to house the Whitney Museum of American Art, will soon become the home of Sotheby\u2019s auction house.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s our partner in crime,\u201d Corbet said of Ada James.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s on these film sets, and she\u2019s, you know, with us every step of the way. She\u2019s there with us at the monitor 90% of the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is the fifth film collaboration between Corbet and Fastvold. It tells the story of fictional Hungarian architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (Adrien Brody) and his writer wife Erzs\u00e9bet (Felicity Jones), Holocaust survivors who struggle to adapt to American life and grapple with the demands of wealthy industrialist Harrison Van Buren (Guy Pearce).",
      "It\u2019s a heavyweight contender at this Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards, where it\u2019s nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture. Corbet is nominated for best director, while he and Fastvold are up for best original screenplay.",
      "The partners take turns in the director\u2019s chair from project to project. Their previous collaborations include 2018\u2019s \u201cVox Lux\u201d starring Natalie Portman and the 2020 release \u201cThe World to Come\u201d featuring Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby. The dynamic will continue this year with their latest film, \u201cAnn Lee,\u201d a historical musical drama starring Amanda Seyfried. Fastvold directed, and Corbet co-wrote it with her.",
      "\u201cBrady likes to write at night, and I write early in the morning,\u201d Fastvold, 38, said. \u201cAnd then we write together in the middle of the day.\u201d",
      "They\u2019ve got it down to a routine, quite literally finishing each other\u2019s sentences.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not very dogmatic about it, and I think that writing in general, even if you\u2019re writing something on your own, which we both occasionally do as well, it\u2019s an improvisational process where, you know, the first rule of improv is, you know, never say no,\u201d Corbet said. \u201cAnd I think that chasing a story, chasing an idea, it\u2019s about riffing and building on each other\u2019s proposals.\u201d",
      "A long road to awards season",
      "The duo\u2019s hard work paved the way for critical acclaim and awards buzz. Corbet has already racked up best director honors at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, the U.K.\u2019s equivalent of the Academy Awards. Brody, Jones and Pearce are all nominated for acting Oscars.",
      "But it was a tough road to the Academy Awards for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which is three hours and 35 minutes (including an intermission that's reminiscent of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age epics).",
      "As he promoted the film, Corbet made headlines for underscoring how tough it is to make a living as a filmmaker. In a recent interview on\u00a0the \u201cWTF With Marc Maron\u201d podcast, Corbet said he and Fastvold \u201cmade zero dollars on the last two films we made,\u201d noting that they \u201chad to just live off of a paycheck from three years ago.\u201d",
      "Lining up financing for \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was tough, too. Corbet and Fastvold said they were turned down by multiple potential investors.",
      "\u201cIf I were in their position, I probably would have passed, too,\u201d Corbet said. \u201cIt was following a global pandemic. People were not going to the movies.\u201d",
      "Eventually, along with some of their own savings, Corbet and Fastvold scraped together enough financing to make the movie for about $10 million. That\u2019s a fraction of what large-scale Hollywood movies typically cost. For comparison, last year\u2019s best picture Oscar winner, the three-hour historical drama \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d reportedly was budgeted at $100 million. (Universal Pictures, which released \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and whose international arm distributed \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d outside North America, shares a parent company with NBC News.)",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d wrapped filming in May 2023 and then premiered last year at the Venice Film Festival, where it earned rave reviews. It was scooped up by prestigious studio and distributor A24, which positioned the movie in the thick of the Oscar race.",
      "The film generated some controversy, as well, after editor D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3 said filmmakers used artificial intelligence to enhance Brody\u2019s and Jones\u2019 Hungarian accents. Corbet and Fastvold told NBC News their use of the technology was minimal, ethical \u2014 and necessary.",
      "\u201cI wanted Hungarians to be able to watch the film and have it ring true for them,\u201d Corbet said.",
      "Home again",
      "Beyond the accolades, \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is a major personal milestone for Corbet, 36, who was raised by a single mom, dropped out of high school and started acting in films such as 2003\u2019s \u201cThirteen\u201d before settling into the director\u2019s chair.",
      "\u201cI did not go to film school at all. I did grow up on film sets, and so, of course, there\u2019s probably no better education than that,\u201d he said.",
      "The success of \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is also gratifying for Corbet\u2019s mother, Mary. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very touched by it,\u201d the director said.",
      "As awards season comes to a crescendo, Corbet and Fastvold are looking forward to some family time \u2014 away from the set. The morning after the Oscars, it\u2019s back to their life in Brooklyn, New York.",
      "\u201cYou just gotta go home and, you know, pack lunch and make dinner and then \u2026 we go back into a dark room and keep on trying to make another movie,\u201d Fastvold said.",
      "Corbet, meanwhile, said he\u2019s eager to \u201cbe just dad\u201d again after months of hopping on planes every few days and visiting more than a dozen countries.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been away too much,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that when we finally sort of slow down, we\u2019ll really, really be able to appreciate it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Immigrant rights groups sued the Trump administration on Saturday in hopes of stopping the transfer of immigrants from the U.S. to Guantanamo Bay, according to the suit filed by multiple legal advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "The legal groups filed the lawsuit in Washington, D.C., federal court on behalf of 10 migrants who are in immigration custody in the U.S. and who they say are at \u201cimminent risk\u201d\u00a0of being transferred to the American detention camp in Cuba without legal authority. The suit alleges the transfers are \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and violate federal law and the U.S. Constitution, citing the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment.",
      "The individuals who are at risk of transfer and detention at Guantanamo include seven Venezuelan nationals, one Afghan national, one Pakistani national and one Bangladeshi national.",
      "\u201cThey all have final orders of removal and may [be] transferred at any time, placing them at immediate risk of harm, including the denial of access to the outside world and the likelihood of being subject to horrific, punitive conditions at Guant\u00e1namo,\u201d the advocacy groups alleged in their request for an emergency stay in the transfer of the 10 individuals.",
      "In the suit, the groups said they aren\u2019t challenging the administration\u2019s authority to \u201cdetain the individuals on\u00a0U.S. soil or to directly remove them to their home country or another statutorily authorized country\u201d but the \u201cgovernment\u2019s unprecedented and unlawful decision to transfer and detain them at Guantanamo.\u201d",
      "The groups added, \u201cNever before has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guant\u00e1namo. Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so now. The government has ample detention capacity inside the United\u00a0States, which is far less costly and poses none of the logistical hurdles attendant to detaining people on Guant\u00e1namo.\u201d",
      "Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel in the case and the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, referred to the move as \u201ctheatrics.\u201d",
      "\u201cSending immigrants to a remote abusive prison is not only illegal and unprecedented, but illogical given the additional cost and logistical complications. Ultimately this is about theatrics,\u201d Gelernt said in a statement.",
      "According to the ACLU, the 10 individuals are not gang members and are not \u201chigh risk criminal aliens,\u201d which is the language at the heart of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order allowing migrants to be transferred to Guantanamo.",
      "The government has not provided any notice of when transfers will occur or who will be transferred. But some of these men have already been threatened with transfer to Guantanamo, the ACLU said.",
      "The groups added in the filing that \u201cthe government has refused to provide notice of transfers to Guant\u00e1namo, so they can occur at any moment.\u201d",
      "Last month, the groups filed a suit against the government on behalf of detainees\u2019 family members and groups that provide immigration legal services, claiming the government thwarted \u201caccess to counsel for immigrant detainees\u201d who were transferred from the U.S. and held at Guantanamo, according to the complaint.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, the administration revealed it had detained 178 migrants from Venezuela at Guantanamo Bay. A senior administration official told NBC News last month that all detainees held there were cleared from the facility. Over 170 Venezuelan migrants were deported and one was returned to detention in the U.S. shortly after the administration had begun housing migrants at the facility.",
      "\u201cNothing in U.S. law authorizes ICE to detain people in foreign countries, but that appears to be of no concern to the Trump administration,\u201d Arthur Spitzer, senior counsel at the ACLU of the District of Columbia, said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cFor an administration that has been touting supposed efficiency with taxpayer dollars, President Trump seems eager to waste money on unnecessary and unlawful mistreatment of immigrants.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, announced Saturday that he\u2019s running to be the next mayor of New York City.",
      "Cuomo had been teasing a campaign launch for weeks and is now jumping back into politics just four years after he resigned from the governorship following multiple sexual harassment allegations.",
      "\u201cWe know that the first step towards solving a problem is having the strength, having the courage to recognize it, and we know that today, our New York City is in trouble,\u201d Cuomo said in a nearly 18-minute campaign launch video posted on X.",
      "\u201cBut New Yorkers know the simple answer of what to do when there\u2019s a crisis in leadership. You lead, you act, you do,\u201d the former governor added.",
      "He also ran through a list of accomplishments from his time as governor, telling viewers, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do these things because they were easy. They weren\u2019t. They were hard, but they were necessary, and today it is necessary to launch a bold action plan to turn New York City around, to save our city.\u201d",
      "Cuomo\u2019s campaign launch comes as Mayor Eric Adams, also a Democrat, has been embroiled in scandal for months following a federal indictment on corruption charges.",
      "The case against Adams is stalled as the Justice Department, led by President Donald Trump\u2019s political appointees, seek to dismiss the charges.",
      "A handful of other Democratic candidates \u2014 including city Comptroller Brad Lander, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, state Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani\u00a0and state Sens. Jessica Ramos and Zellnor Myrie\u00a0\u2014 are also running ahead of the June 24 primary, challenging Adams\u2019 path to a second term.",
      "In a statement minutes after Cuomo launched his campaign, Stringer blasted the former governor, saying that Cuomo \u201cspent years treating New York City like his personal punching bag \u2014 slashing MTA funding and wrecking the subway while funneling money to upstate ski resorts, and trying to cut billions in funding for public school kids and Medicaid for city residents. And now he wants New Yorkers to rehabilitate his reputation? Give me a break.\u201d",
      "Before he resigned in 2021, the former governor enjoyed high approval ratings, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as he gave near-daily briefings to New Yorkers and appeared often on CNN while his brother, Chris Cuomo, was an anchor there.",
      "But as allegations of sexual harassment, including by nine state employees, surfaced, Cuomo faced bipartisan calls to step down.",
      "A 2021 report written by state Attorney General Letitia James alleged that Cuomo had harassed 11 women and subjected some of them to uninvited touching and groping.",
      "In his resignation speech, Cuomo told New Yorkers, \u201cIn my mind, I\u2019ve never crossed the line with anyone, but I didn\u2019t realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn. There are generational and cultural shifts that I just didn\u2019t fully appreciate.\u201d",
      "He also said at the time that he stepped down not because of the allegations, but because \u201cwasting energy on distraction is the last thing government should be.\u201d",
      "In his campaign launch video on Saturday, Cuomo seemed to nod to the past allegations against him, saying, \u201cDid I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not. Would I do some things differently, knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully, definitely, and I believe I learned from them, and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show you that every day.\u201d",
      "Before he even launched his campaign on Saturday, Cuomo had already earned the endorsement of Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., who told the New York Post on Monday that \u201cAndrew Cuomo has the competence to govern the city. He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics \u2014 both from the far left and far right.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmerica loves a comeback, New York loves a comeback,\u201d Torres added.",
      "Cuomo held his first campaign event on Saturday at a Dominican restaurant in the Bronx. At the event, he received the endorsement of New York Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia, whose district includes parts of the Bronx.",
      "\u201cAll too often the needs of my constituents are ignored. That wasn\u2019t the case when Andrew Cuomo was Governor,\u201d Tapia said in a statement. \u201cHe passed historic legislation to raise the minimum wage, protect tenants, and keep our streets safe.\u201d"

      "The trio were ordered to remain behind bars after a prosecutor said in court that they were part of a group \u201ctied to multiple homicides that have occurred across the United States.\u201d",
      "Neither Zajko nor anyone else has been charged in her parents\u2019 murder, but family and friends say they now have hope for the first time that there will be a break in the case.",
      "\u201cHopefully, there will finally be justice for Rich and Rita,\u201d said a family friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "A bright future",
      "The Zajkos lived in a neighborhood of stately homes and well-landscaped lawns located about 30 miles west of Philadelphia.",
      "Michelle was their only child. She was adopted as a baby and raised at the home in Chester Heights.",
      "She went on to study biology at the now-defunct Cabrini University in Pennsylvania before earning a master's degree in bioinformatics at Temple University, according to her LinkedIn page.",
      "She was a high-achieving student with lofty goals. Michelle Zajko worked as a research intern at the esteemed Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. She also interned at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California, studying how spaceflight stresses the human body.",
      "\u201cI want to help save people for my career,\u201d she told the Cabrini University student newspaper.",
      "Her parents owned several rental units in a development in the nearby town of Aston. In the years before the killings, Richard Zajko spent much of his time checking in on their tenants and fixing whatever needed to be fixed, two of the tenants said in interviews.",
      "\u201cIf there was an issue, he was Johnny on the spot,\u201d said one who asked to remain anonymous.",
      "But Richard Zajko wasn\u2019t just a responsive landlord. He charged his tenants far less than other units went for and repeatedly encouraged them to save enough so that they could buy their own homes, according to the two former tenants.",
      "\u201cHe genuinely cared about people,\u201d said the other tenant, who also asked to remain anonymous.",
      "When he found out a couple renting one of his apartments was having a baby, Zajko lit up. He talked about how thrilled he and his wife were when they adopted their daughter.",
      "Michelle was in her late 20s by then and had left home long ago. But Zajko made an offer to the tenants that left them stunned: Would they like to have Michelle\u2019s baby clothes?",
      "A shocking crime",
      "Investigators determined that the Zajkos were killed on Dec. 31, 2022 \u2014\u00a0the same day Michelle turned 30.",
      "Rita, 69, had a gunshot wound to the back of her head, her autopsy found. Richard, 71, had taken a bullet to his right hand and another to his right temple, according to his autopsy.",
      "Their bodies were discovered in an upstairs bedroom. No gun was found at the scene, according to court records, but there were two 9 mm shell casings \u2014\u00a0each bearing a stamped impression of \u201c9mm Luger +P SIG.\u201d",
      "Three days later, investigators with the Vermont and Pennsylvania state police traveled to Michelle Zajko\u2019s home in Coventry, Vermont, a remote town about 20 miles south of the Canadian border. Zajko confirmed to the investigators that she owned a firearm \u2014 a semiautomatic handgun that fires 9 mm-type ammunition, according to court records.",
      "She allowed the investigators to hold the gun, but they didn\u2019t have a warrant to seize it.",
      "\u201cIn handling and observing said firearm, it was found to be free of dust, dirt or debris \u2014 appearing to be well kept and recently cleaned and/or serviced,\u201d a Vermont State Police search warrant affidavit said.",
      "Zajko told troopers that she was in Vermont in the days before and after New Year\u2019s Eve, the affidavit says, and that she had not spoken to her parents since January 2022.",
      "The investigators later learned that Zajko had purchased the gun at a local sporting goods store, along with a box of ammunition of the same manufacture and type as the spent casings found at the murder scene in Pennsylvania, the affidavit says.",
      "They sought a search warrant for the gun and ammunition that they believed was still inside Zajko\u2019s home. But on the same day it was filed, Jan. 12, 2023, Zajko was actually in Pennsylvania for her parents\u2019 funeral. That\u2019s when Pennsylvania state troopers, carrying a separate search warrant, went to the Candlewood Suites hotel in pursuit of Zajko and her gun.",
      "There was no gun or ammunition inside Zajko\u2019s hotel room. But after she allegedly bolted from the Pennsylvania State Police barracks, troopers returned to the hotel and found the gun in a room where two of her associates were staying, the Vermont state police affidavit says.",
      "The investigators tried to reach Zajko again but had no luck. She was, at that point, in the wind.",
      "Six deaths in three states",
      "Two years passed with no developments in the case. Then on Jan. 20 of this year, a Border Patrol agent, David Maland, was killed in a gunbattle in northern Vermont. The shooting broke out after Maland and other agents pulled over a car that was occupied by two people \u2014 Ophelia Bauckholt and Teresa Youngblut.",
      "Federal prosecutors say Youngblut opened fire after she got out of the car, prompting at least one agent to shoot back. Bauckholt was fatally shot as she drew a gun, prosecutors say, and Youngblut was also shot but survived."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The \u201cwanted\u201d posters were sent by mail, arriving at the homes of Carmen Lau\u2019s neighbors in the town of Maidenhead.",
      "The alleged crime? Speaking out about China\u2019s rule in Hong Kong, where Lau has not lived since 2021.",
      "Provide information about Lau to the Hong Kong Police Force, urged the poster, folded into envelopes with Hong Kong stamps, or \u201ctake her to the Chinese embassy.\u201d",
      "The reward: 1 million Hong Kong dollars, or $130,000.",
      "The flyers that arrived in this town 7 miles from Windsor Castle are the latest threat directed at Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy diaspora, who have fled the city trying to escape the long arm of Chinese law, only to find that harassment can cross borders.",
      "Lau, who spoke to NBC News from outside the U.K. on Friday, said she did not \u201cfeel safe living at my current address,\u201d and was now weighing temporary residence options elsewhere. (NBC News is not disclosing Lau\u2019s current location for her safety.)",
      "Joshua Reynolds, Maidenhead\u2019s MP, says at least five people reported receiving the letters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unsure what to do about it, they\u2019re unsure why they received it, or what was going on,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Friday, adding that he had called Lau about them.",
      "Reynolds showed NBC News three identical posters that included Lau\u2019s headshot and information including an address, date of birth, ethnicity, build and height. Reynolds said he knows of at least one other Hong Kong activist whose neighbors have received similar letters.",
      "\u201cA reward of one million Hong Kong dollars is being offered by Hong Kong Police to any member of the public, who can provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to the Chinese embassy,\u201d it reads.",
      "Those with information should contact an email address or the Hong Kong Police Force\u2019s\u00a0British WhatsApp number, it says.",
      "\u201cThe bounty is because they want to silence us and they want to instill fear among our diaspora,\u201d said Lau, who fled Hong Kong in 2021 after the former British colony enacted a sweeping and vaguely worded national security law that gave the government more power to quash dissent.",
      "The law followed a political crackdown triggered by Hong Kong\u2019s 2019 pro-democracy protests. It threatens stringent penalties for a wide range of actions authorities call threats to national security, with the most severe \u2014 including treason and insurrection \u2014 punishable by life imprisonment. Lesser offenses, including the possession of seditious publications, could also lead to several years in jail.",
      "Lau was declared a criminal by police after she fled Hong Kong. The city\u2019s police placed the bounty on her after accusing her of violating the national security law and calling for her return.",
      "She said Hong Kong police had taken her relatives in for questioning twice this month. NBC News could not confirm her account.",
      "Calling the posters \u201cawful,\u201d Reynolds said it was \u201cjust not acceptable\u201d if it was true the flyers had been sent from China.",
      "It was not clear who sent the posters. A spokesperson from Hong Kong\u2019s government said it would \u201cnot issue any anonymous letter\u201d but that it \u201cwill definitely pursue\u201d those who had fled the territory \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201ctake every measure\u201d to bring them back.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in London did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Anonymous harassment has also been an issue within Hong Kong. In September, the Hong Kong Journalists Association said people from dozens of media outlets had received threatening messages in a \u201csystematic and organized\u201d campaign, calling it the largest-scale harassment of reporters it had ever seen.",
      "This is not the first time concerns have been raised about the safety of Hong Kong democracy activists living in Britain, which took in more than 120,000 people from its former colony in response to the national security law.",
      "Last May, British authorities charged three men, including the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London, with surveilling and gathering intelligence against Hong Kong democracy activists.",
      "Later that month, one of the men, Matthew Trickett, was found dead in a park, also in Maidenhead. Two other men, Chung Biu Yuen and Chi Leung Peter Wai, will go on trial next month. They deny the charges, which include breaking into a residence.",
      "Chinese officials have called the charges \u201cgroundless and slanderous.\u201d",
      "Reynolds, Maidenhead\u2019s MP, said residents in the town were \u201cconcerned that this looks like the Chinese are trying to interfere in the U.K., and that they don\u2019t want to be frightened by what\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "He added that police had told him they were making sure Lau \u201cgets the protection and security she requires.\u201d",
      "Thames Valley Police did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Reynolds, a member of the opposition Liberal Democrats party, said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by the British government\u2019s approach toward China.",
      "The Labour Party, which is currently in power, has been accused of complacency toward Beijing after ministers signaled their support for China\u2019s proposed plan to build a \u201cmega embassy\u201d in London.",
      "The plan has also been criticized by U.S. lawmakers, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., and Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., both of whom serve on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. In an open letter Wednesday, they said a Chinese Embassy of that scale would \u201conly embolden its efforts to intimidate and harass UK citizens and dissidents and experts across Europe.\u201d",
      "A British government spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday that \u201cattempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass, or harm their critics overseas, undermining democracy and the rule of law, are unacceptable,\u201d adding that they would \u201cencourage anyone to report concerns to the police.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the criticism of the Chinese Embassy plans.",
      "Lau said she had not been contacted by Britain\u2019s Home Office, the government department responsible for immigration and security, or the Foreign Office.",
      "\u201cI will just continue my work because if I back down or if I really silence myself, that\u2019s what they want,\u201d she added."

      "\"I've been a very shallow person. I used to try to dance around that a little, but I just have. And that obviously has not worked. I really don't want to be that way at all. I know I'm way better than that,\" he said during one of their dates.",

      "\"I have been giving 150% the last week to try to figure things out with you and you've not given me that ... You were giving me nothing. You were giving me no validation. You were not letting me in in any capacity,\" she replied.",

    "summary": "This year\u2019s Oscars race has been a historic one. But amid a history-making season, there\u2019s been an equal amount of controversies surrounding some of the nominees.",
    "story": [
      "This year\u2019s Oscars race has been one for the books. It\u2019s been a time to recognize the work of some of Hollywood\u2019s finest and to celebrate first-time and historic nominations.",
      "But it seems that amid this history-making season, there\u2019s been an equal amount of controversies. Many of the best picture nominees have been mired in headlines that have nothing to do with the movie.",
      "Here's what to know about the Oscars race we can't look away from.",
      "All the ways the 2025 Oscars movies faced controversy",
      "One movie takes the award for most-nominated \u2014 and most controversial. Netflix's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d officially holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for a non-English language film.",
      "Garnering 13 nods, including ones for best picture, best director, best actress and supporting actress for Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Zoe Salda\u00f1a, respectively, the film beat out previous record holders such as \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u201d (2000) and \u201cRoma\u201d (2018).",
      "The Spanish-language musical crime thriller, written and directed by Jacques Audiard, follows a criminal defense attorney (Salda\u00f1a) who helps a Mexican cartel leader (Gasc\u00f3n) disappear so he can transition into a woman.",
      "While there were some mixed reactions to the film, including GLAAD, who called it \u201ca step backward for trans representation,\u201d the film received mostly positive reviews from critics, including the New York Times, which said Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s performance added \u201csoul to the melodrama.\u201d",
      "But in late January, less than three months after its release, Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s rise as an award show favorite was quickly halted after a journalist shared some of her past tweets online, which many deemed offensive. Following the backlash, the actor issued an apology through Netflix and gave an interview to CNN Espa\u00f1ol Feb. 2, addressing her past comments and noting that she used her social media \u201cmore like a diary\u201d than as a platform with influence. Some felt that the actor didn\u2019t take full accountability for her actions, including the film's director, who told Deadline Feb. 5 that Gasc\u00f3n was \u201cself-destructive\u201d and needed \u201cspace to reflect and take accountability for her actions.\u201d",
      "While Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s past tweets and her recent responses to the backlash have cast a shadow over the film and her buzz-worthy portrayal, the actor\u2019s indiscretions weren\u2019t the only thing about \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d that have caused controversy.",
      "Some viewers have questioned why Audiard, a French man who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, served as director. Others, like Mexican actor and singer Mauricio Mart\u00ednez, criticized the director\u2019s self-admitted lack of research about the country and its people while making the film.",
      "Other criticisms surrounding the film included the perceived dismissal of Mexican culture by not casting Mexican actors in most of the lead roles and Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish language skills, among other issues pointed out by viewers.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n isn\u2019t the only first-time best actress nominee that has caught flak for past or recent behavior. \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d Oscar nominee Fernanda Torres, who plays a mother coping with the disappearance of her politician husband, also recently made headlines after a 2008 clip of her in blackface resurfaced online.",
      "In a statement to Deadline Jan. 26, Torres apologized for appearing in blackface, saying she was \u201cvery sorry\u201d and that at the time \u201cthe awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn\u2019t yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil.\u201d The actor\u2019s apology followed her best actress Golden Globe win in early January and her best actress Oscar nod, which made her the second Brazilian actress (after her mom, Fernanda Montenegro) to ever be nominated for that award. If she wins, she would make history as the first Brazilian actress to take home that Oscar.",
      "\"Anora\" had a controversy of its own. First-time Oscar nominee Mikey Madison, who plays a stripper who falls for the son of a Russian oligarch, received backlash after her comments for her decision not to use an intimacy coordinator on set.",
      "\u201cIt was a choice that I made,\u201d Madison said in a conversation with Pamela Anderson for Variety\u2018s Actors on Actors. The actor said she was offered the option of an intimacy coordinator by the film\u2019s director, Sean Baker, and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, but she and her co-star, Mark Eydelshteyn, \u201cdecided that it would be best just to keep it small. We were able to streamline it, shoot it super quickly.\u201d",
      "Some fans online took issue with an intimacy coordinator being a choice and not a \u201cmandatory requirement\u201d on set, while others felt her comments could \u201clead to other directors thinking intimacy coordinators aren\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Baker had previously told Variety that keeping \u201cactors safe, protected, comfortable and involved in the process\u201d was his team\u2019s No. 1 priority on set, but still some argued that Madison was \u201cmanipulated\u201d into not using one.",
      "It\u2019s not just films with best actress nominees that have been put through wringer this award show season. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which landed 10 Oscar nominations, including a best actor nod for its star Adrien Brody, has sparked a slew of backlash for its use of artificial intelligence.",
      "The movie, which follows a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who struggles in the U.S. until a wealthy client recognizes his talent as a visionary architect, used AI to digitally alter the Hungarian accents of actors Brody and Felicity Jones, neither of whom speaks Hungarian natively. Though the film\u2019s director, Brady Corbet, went on to defend his use of AI in the movie in a statement to Deadline, some fans said the use of the technology diminished the film\u2019s \u201cauthenticity.\u201d",
      "Another major contender, \u201cConclave,\u201d which received a best picture and best actor nomination for Ralph Fiennes, caused a bit of a stir among Catholics. Centering around scandals and power struggles within a fictional papal conclave, the film ignited a holy, or rather unholy, debate about the film being \u201canti-Catholic propaganda,\u201d as some Catholic publications put it.",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, the bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, shared his criticism of the film on X, calling it an \u201cirredeemable situation\u201d and advising others to \u201crun away from it as fast as you can.\u201d His sentiments, which were viewed over one million times, were also reflected by various conservative commentators who said Catholics should be upset with the film.",
      "Then, just as some of the online chatter about the controversies surrounding this year\u2019s nominated projects appeared to quiet down ahead of the award show on March 2, a new controversy concerning \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d director Ali Abbasi emerged just days after Oscar voting ended on Feb. 18.",
      "After multiple outlets reported that Abbasi was dropped by his talent agency and management after an alleged groping incident that reportedly happened at a Golden Globes party, Abbasi took to X to address the reports and apologize for his actions.",
      "\u201cI made an over-familiar gesture \u2014 a slap on the rear \u2014 which I intended as playful and not in any sexual way whatsoever,\u201d he wrote in part. \u201cI quickly realized I had misjudged the situation. I apologized to him on the spot, and the following day I made sure my apology was reiterated through my representatives.\u201d",
      "He also refuted reports that he was \u201cdropped\u201d by his representation \u201cdue to this interaction.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy decision to part ways was a long-term career decision that was not shaped by short motivations. I believe in taking accountability for my actions; I made a mistake, I apologized and have learned a valuable life lesson,\u201d he added.",
      "Abbasi\u2019s film, which follows Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power as a real estate mogul in the \u201880s under the mentorship of lawyer Roy Cohn, landed two Oscar nods, one for Sebastian Stan as Trump and one for Jeremy Strong, who portrayed Cohn.",
      "How the 2025 Oscars also were a landmark for history-making representation",
      "Amid the onslaught of controversies, there\u2019s a silver lining to the Oscars this year: there\u2019s a big opportunity for some major history to be made.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n became the first openly trans actress to receive an Oscar nomination. This year also marks the first time four Latino performers were nominated in Oscar acting categories \u2014 Gasc\u00f3n, Salda\u00f1a, Torres, and Colman Domingo.",
      "Domingo, who was nominated for his portrayal of Bayard Rustin in \u201cRustin\u201d last year, also has an opportunity to become the first Afro-Latino to win the best actor Oscar for his performance in \u201cSing Sing,\u201d a prison-drama that follows incarcerated men who take part in a theater arts rehabilitation program.",
      "Meanwhile, Cynthia Erivo, nominated for her portrayal of Elphaba in \u201cWicked,\u201d has the potential to become the youngest EGOT winner, or winner of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.",
      "She already has a 2016 Tony for her role as Celie in Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d a 2017 Grammy for best musical theater album for \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and a 2017 Daytime Emmy for her performance on TODAY with the cast of \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d",
      "The film, which follows the complicated friendship of two witches, marks the third time Erivo has had a shot at the coveted honor; she received a best actress Oscar nod for \u201cHarriet\u201d in 2020 and another nod for best original song for \u201cStand Up\u201d from the same film.",
      "While it's uncertain if Erivo will take home the Oscar on Sunday night, the singer talked about the tough lessons she's learned along the way during her acceptance speech at the Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards on Feb. 27. She compared her journey to Elphaba's and encouraged the audience \u2014 filled with Black women \u2014 to recognize their value regardless if others acknowledged or honored them for it.",
      "\"Elphaba's journey as a woman seen as different and cast aside for the very thing that makes her unique speaks to the heart of every Black woman who has ever been judged and misunderstood and yet still learned that her power was a gift or love,\" Erivo said. \"So I thought that I, Cynthia, would speak to your hearts. I wanted to take this opportunity as more than an opportunity to accept this beautiful award and honor, and I wanted to use it as a way to affirm you all.\"",
      "She continued, \"You weren't insane when you were dreaming of being a superhero. You weren't asking too much when you wanted to be seen for the lead. When you were little and you believed you could fly, that wasn't a fairy tale. When you look at the mirror and the thought crosses your mind, if only for a fleeting moment that you might be in possession of power for magic entertainment thought, do not dismiss it. Nourish it, because it's real.\"",
      "Essence's annual soiree, which celebrates the cinematic achievements of Hollywood's finest, including Teyana Taylor, Raamla Mohamed, Marla Gibbs, and the Lexus Uptown Honors Hollywood Awards are examples of culturally significant events during Oscars week that  continue to highlight and celebrate actors and creatives in a way that big award shows don't.",
      "Jeff Friday, founder of ABFF Ventures and annual events like the American Black Film Festival and ABBF Honors, said that these type of celebrations not only acknowledge the history-making achievements of those in the industry but they put their culture and what they represent at the forefront.",
      "\"I think it's really up to us. Instead of asking questions like, 'Why don't we get the validation and celebration we deserve?' I think it's really up to us to invest in our own celebration,\u201d Friday told TODAY.com during the Lexus Uptown Honors Hollywood Awards on Feb. 26. \"Our message and our mission is more about economic empowerment ... It's about investing in your own culture.\"",

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s no secret that an Oscar win, or even\u00a0nomination, can transform an actor or filmmaker\u2019s career.",
      "It\u2019s also no secret that Hollywood\u2019s most prestigious awards are handed out by \u201cthe Academy\u201d each year \u2014 but what exactly is the Academy, and how do its members decide who wins awards?",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about who chooses Oscar nominees and winners, and the Oscars voting process.",
      "Who is part of the Academy?",
      "More than 10,500 \u201cglobal film industry artists and leaders\u201d are members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, according to the Academy\u2019s\u00a0website.",
      "Members include actors, writers, directors, costume designers, makeup artists, producers and other film industry professionals.",
      "The Academy expands its membership each year. Last year, nearly 400 industry insiders\u00a0were invited to join, including actors Selma Blair, Austin Butler, Paul Mescal, Ke Huy Quan, Stephanie Hsu and Keke Palmer.",
      "Taylor Swift, who penned a song for the 2022 film \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing,\u201d and Abel \u201cThe Weeknd\u201d Tesfaye, who contributed a song to 2022\u2019s \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water,\u201d were also among the artists invited to join in the music branch last year.",
      "The Academy\u2019s\u00a0Board of Governors, which \u201cdirects the Academy\u2019s strategic vision,\u201d per is website, is also comprised of several notable industry professionals, including director Ava DuVernay in the directors branch and Rita Wilson in the actors branch.",
      "How do people join the Academy in the first place?",
      "It isn\u2019t possible to apply to the Academy, but industry members\u00a0can be sponsored\u00a0by two other Academy members. The Board of Governors makes the final decision on whether a sponsor gets an invitation for membership.",
      "All Oscar nominees, meanwhile, are automatically considered for membership in the Academy and do not need to be sponsored, per the\u00a0Academy\u2019s website.",
      "A staff of more than 700 people \u201cconduct the Academy\u2019s day-to-day business,\u201d according to the Academy\u2019s website.",
      "The Academy oversees other awards in addition to the Oscars: the Governors Awards, which highlight a handful of individuals\u2019 creative and humanitarian achievements, the Student Academy Awards, and the Scientific and Technical Awards.",
      "The voting process for Oscar nominations",
      "The voting process for the Oscars begins well before the nominations are announced. For the 97th Academy Awards, the submission deadline for general entry categories was in mid-November, and preliminary voting began on Dec. 9, 2024, according to the Academy\u2019s\u00a0website.",
      "A shortlist was announced later in December. The Academy members' voting period in January was extended twice due to the wildfires, Deadline reported.",
      "All Academy members are eligible to nominate films for best picture picture, but for most of the 24 Oscars categories, Academy members vote for nominees within their own field \u2014 so, actors nominate actors, editors nominate editors, and so forth.",
      "Best international feature film and best animated feature have specific nomination rules.",
      "In the case of the\u00a0international feature film\u00a0category, nominees are chosen via two rounds of voting, which all Academy members are invited to partake in. In the first round, members vote by secret ballot to create a shortlist of 15 nominees from the eligible submissions. Then, members vote again to narrow this list to five nominees. In this second round of voting, members are required to have seen all 15 films on the shortlist.",
      "Similarly, all members can also vote on the\u00a0best animated feature film.",
      "The 97th Academy Awards nominations were\u00a0announced in a live ceremony\u00a0on Jan. 23.",
      "Who votes for Oscar winners?",
      "In the final step, which is choosing winners,\u00a0all\u00a0voting members of the Academy can vote on\u00a0all\u00a0Oscar categories, per the\u00a0Academy\u2019s website.",
      "Final votes are conducted online, and the results are tabulated by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.",
      "How are Oscar winners decided?",
      "For most categories, the nominee with the most votes wins.",
      "It\u2019s a bit more complicated for best picture. Since 2009, the Academy has used ranked-choice voting system, or a preferential ballot, to determine best picture. The Oscars says this is the \u201cfairest possible\u201d outcome for nominations\u00a0in a video on its YouTube page. The\u00a0Hollywood Reporter\u00a0phrases it differently: \u201cThe point of it is to ensure that the best picture winner is the movie that is the most\u00a0widely\u00a0liked by the electorate.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s how it works. Voters rank the eligible films in order of their preference. If one film receives the majority of the top votes, it\u2019s automatically the winner. If no single nominee gets over 50% of the vote, the movie with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the voters who had\u00a0that\u00a0film as their number one have their votes count for their next choice.",
      "This process continues until one movie gets over 50% of the share.",
      "Only two partners at PwC know the results before they are announced live during the Oscars ceremony,\u00a0per the Academy\u2019s\u00a0website.",
      "Despite the rigorous protocols around selecting winners and guarding the results, human error can still bungle the process \u2014 just recall the\u00a0infamous flub at the 2017 Oscars, when \u201cLa La Land\u201d was mistakenly announced as the winner for Best Picture, instead of the actual winner, \u201cMoonlight.\u201d",
      "That night, an official from PwC accidentally handed presenter Warren Beatty the envelope containing the winner for best actress (Emma Stone for \u201cLa La Land\u201d)\u00a0instead of the best picture envelope, and after a moment of confusion, Beatty read out \u201cLa La Land\u201d as the Best Picture winner.",
      "\u201cOne of the most disappointing things to me was all the great work that had been done, not only last year but over the last 83 years, around accuracy, confidentiality (and) integrity of that process,\u201d PwC senior partner Tim Ryan told the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0in 2018. \u201cAnd where we got it wrong was on the handing over of the envelope.\u201d",
      "PwC, which helped build the digital system used for Oscars voting and also handles the Academy\u2019s taxes, according to the AP, said they were introducing new procedures and safeguards to ensure such an error couldn\u2019t happen again.",
      "The 97th Academy Awards will air on ABC on March 2, 2024, at 7 p.m. ET."

      "In an essay she penned for Marie Claire in 2010, she recalled young Musk as \u201ca clean-cut, upper-class boy with a South African accent who appeared in front of me one afternoon as I was leaping up the steps to my dorm. He said we\u2019d met at a party I knew I hadn\u2019t been to. (Years later, he would confess that he had noticed me from across the common room and decided he wanted to meet me.)\u201d",

As the financial tech company\u2019s largest shareholder, Musk made $165 million from the deal, according to CNN Business. Meanwhile, his wife launched her own career as a dark fantasy author.",

And just two years after that, the Musk family added three more sons with the arrival of triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian.",

      "Amber Heard",
      "A year after Musk\u2019s divorce from Riley and a year after \u201cAquaman\u201d star Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp, the two high-profile personalities began publicly dating.",
      "By May of 2017, things seemed solid for the couple, as Heard shared photos to Instagram featuring an Australian vacation in which she can be seen frolicking with Musk\u2019s sons.",
      "However, as the year progressed, their relationship was rumored to be off and on, and in November 2017, Musk opened up about their split in Rolling Stone.",
      "\u201cI just broke up with my girlfriend,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cI was really in love, and it hurt bad. ... Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think.\u201d",
      "Grimes",
      "Though it\u2019s hard to say exactly when they started dating or when they officially broke up, Musk and singer-songwriter Grimes had an on-again, off-again partnership that lasted around three years, per Vanity Fair.",
      "In May 2018, after several weeks of dating rumors, the couple attended the Met Gala together, seemingly confirming their relationship status. But by August, they were contending with split rumors after reports from sources including Business Insider shared that the two unfollowed each other on social media.",
      "It appeared they were going strong again in 2020, as they welcomed a son, X \u00c6 A-Xii, followed by another child via surrogate in 2021, a girl named Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l.",
      "In March 2022, Grimes told Vanity Fair, \u201cI would probably refer to him as\u00a0my boyfriend, but we\u2019re very fluid. We live in separate houses. We\u2019re best friends.\u201d",
      "At least that was the case at the time.",
      "By the time the story was published, she had another update to share, writing on X, formerly Twitter, \u201cMe and E have broken up *again* since the writing of this article haha, but he\u2019s my best friend and the love of my life.\u201d",
      "In mid-June of 2022, Musk and Grimes \u2014 perhaps as a couple, perhaps as best friends \u2014 welcomed another son. They named him Techno Mechanicus.",
      "Shivon Zilis",
      "During his on-and-off relationship with Grimes, Musk dipped into another relationship, this time with Shivon Zilis, an executive at Neuralink, a neurotechnology company Musk co-founded and owns.",
      "In November 2021, the two welcomed twins Strider and Azure via in vitro fertilization.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a fool for love. I am often a fool, but especially for love,\u201d Musk is quoted in Walter Isaacson\u2019s 2023 biography, \u201cElon Musk.\u201d",
      "But according to Zilis, love had nothing to do with bringing their children into the world. Strictly speaking, the two weren\u2019t even in a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cHe really wants smart people to have kids, so he encouraged me to do this,\u201d Zilis explained in the book. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly think of genes I would prefer for my children.\u201d",
      "In February 2024, Musk and Zilis welcomed their third child, Arcadia. About a year later, Zilis announced on X that they had welcomed son Seldon Lycurgus.",
      "She wrote, \u201cDiscussed with Elon and, in light of beautiful Arcadia\u2019s birthday, we felt it was better to also just share directly about our wonderful and incredible son Seldon Lycurgus. Built like a juggernaut, with a solid heart of gold. Love him so much.\u201d",
      "In response, Musk shared a heart emoji to her post."

      "Pinkney says Morrison would handwrite her children\u2019s books, as she did her adult books. Periodically, Pinkney would receive installments via fax machine.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to embrace you and show you that you have worth. You have agency. You have dignity \u2014 you\u2019re never alone, because here we are.\u201d",
      "What Andrea Davis Pinkney says books told her as a child",
      "\u201cShe had a very curly, artistic, calligraphic handwriting, She would then call me and say, \u2018Andrea, go to the fax machine.\u2019 Out of the fax would come this waxy paper with her handwriting on it. We\u2019d line them up and like a beautiful mosaic, that is how the narratives for young people came together,\u201d she says.",
      "Their connection goes deeper than their working relationship. In Morrison, Pinkney found someone whose story arc echoed her own.",
      "Growing up, both women were integrated into their elementary schools and were the only Black students in their first grade classrooms. Pinkney describes the feeling of being the only Black student  in first grade as \u201canxious apartness,\u201d or the feeling that \u201cyou are completely alone in the world.\u201d",
      "During this time, Pinkney found solace in books and stories. \u201cThey said, \u2018Come. You belong here,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWe're here to embrace you and show you that you have worth. You have agency. You have dignity \u2014 you're never alone, because here we are.\u201d",
      "After working in publishing, Pinkney, like Morrison, became an author. She learned from Morrison to wake up early (very early \u2014 think 4 a.m.) to better convene with the \u201cmuse.\u201d",
      "She specializes in children's books, linking pivotal moments in history with beautiful illustration \u2014 often from her husband, award-winning illustrator\u00a0Brian Pinkney (though \"And She Was Loved\" was illustrated by Daniel Minter).",
      "Minter's artwork is a \u201cvisual ode\u201d to Morrison \u2014 and the covers tell a deliberate story about Morrison's philosophy.",
      "\u201cToni Morrison was committed to representing, rendering and celebrating Blackness,\u201d Pinkney says. \u201c(On the cover), she's looking right at us. When you peel off the case cover, there she is again. We, as a people, must always be front and center. We must show our faces. We must show up. We must look at you.\u201d",
      "With her book, Pinkney hopes to capture what Morrison provided for her readers and what books meant to Pinkney as a girl. \u201cThe title means everything to me. Toni Morrison left all of us that feeling of love,\u201d she says.",
      "It's fitting that Pinkney's last conversation with Morrison before her death in 2019 was about the importance of books for children.",
      "\u201cShe said something about the importance of giving young people enjoyment \u2014 lifting them up through the enjoyment of a story,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t just come in guns blazing going, \u2018We need to get engaged,\u2019\u201d Vanessa Lachey said of the cast. \u201cThey really pulled back the curtain, if you will, and peeled back the layers of themselves and the couples to really get down to it.\u201d",
      "Nick Lachey said this season's geographical location impacted the vibe of the cast and couples, too.",
      "\u201cMinnesota is totally Midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different pool of people here. So, every season\u2019s different. And I think what people will find in this particular season is that it\u2019s very, very ... I don\u2019t want to say\u00a0sweet, but it\u2019s more, it\u2019s more heartfelt.\u201d",
      "By the end of Episode 6, five couples agreed to get married, sight unseen, while two pairs realized that they weren\u2019t ready to move onto the next part of the experiment.",

      "Devin and Virginia",
      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller hit it off in the pods after learning that they both attended the same Minnesota high school. But, Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, was a student at the school a few years after Virginia, a 34-year-old healthcare recruiter, graduated and the two had never crossed paths.",
      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "In Honduras, Virginia and Devin continued to get along but had a minor disagreement when they moved in together. After the couple visited their separate apartments and spoke about their future, Virginia suggested that they sign a prenup to establish financial boundaries. She explained that they should each be entitled to the assets they had before meeting each other. Devin was caught off guard and seemed hesitant to agree.",
      "When Devin introduced Virginia to his family, he mentioned the possible prenuptial agreement. His family, particularly his sister Kayla, questioned the idea and wondered if Virginia was already doubting if the marriage would work.",
      "Daniel and Taylor",
      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation. He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along. When she returned to gush with the girls, Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, said she appreciated that Daniel, a 30-year-old sales account executive, repeatedly spoke about searching for the mother of his kids.",
      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",
      "Taylor replied that Daniel made her feel \u201cvery special, very loved and very important.\u201d She then told Daniel that his words to her were the nicest things anyone has ever said to her.",
      "In Episode 6, he read her a letter explaining why he loved her. \u201cAll I want to do is make you feel safe and make you happy for the rest of your life,\u201d Daniel said. He then knelt on one knee and proposed.",
      "\u201cI would love to marry you!\u201d she cheered.",
      "Episode 6 ended on a cliffhanger as all the optimism and excitement Daniel and Taylor shared after meeting each other came to a screeching halt. After the face-to-face reveal, Taylor told the cameras she had an eerie feeling that she recognized Daniel. She spiraled, recalling that a social media user who looked like Daniel briefly followed her on Instagram before she left to film the show.",
      "She met Daniel and voiced her concerns, explaining that she worried he already knew facts based on her profile and used the prior knowledge to woo her. He said he couldn't remember following her and that her description didn't exactly match his account. To confirm the truth, she scrolled through a list of Instagram users who had previously followed her. When she couldn't find his name, she apologized. He was understanding and said he still wanted to take the trip with her Honduras.",
      "The two quickly moved past the tiff and enjoyed their vacation in Honduras. After they returned, they met each other's families and gushed about their connection. Daniel also introduced his parents to Taylor's mom and dad, who stressed that divorce wasn't an option in their family.",
      "Joey and Monica",
      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",

      "Joey and Monica spent their time in Honduras learning more about each other and their idiosyncrasies, like her family's shared \"sock bin.\" It appeared the two would have a drama-free path to the finale \u2014 until Joey met Monica's family.",
      "While her parents were welcoming and invited Joey to participate in their family jam session, Monica's older sister, Nicolle, quietly eyed Joey from her seat. When she pulled Monica to have a private conversation outside, Nicolle mentioned that Joey wasn't her sister's usual type. She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",
      "At their apartment, Joey shared that he could tell Nicolle didn't warm to him. After Monica revealed what she spoke about with Nicolle, Joey suggested that jealousy might be the cause of Nicolle's disapproval.",
      "Nicolle later takes Joey and Monica's engagement photos and appears to come around.",
      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "In Episode 10, the couple meets Sara's sister and her partner, who express worry and skepticism over her sister's new relationship.",
      "\u201cI see that you have a strong connection, but this is not real right now,\u201d Lisa, Sara's sister, told her.",
      "Sara appears to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",
      "Season 8 couples who are no longer together",
      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",
      "Despite Lauren\u2019s friends also supporting her, Dave could not fully trust Lauren, creating a strain in their relationship as they approached wedding day.",
      "The couple broke up in Episode 11 of the series in a long conversation that covered her past fling \u2014 which they still didn't share an understanding of \u2014 and Dave's talk with her father.",
      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",
      "Lauren, meanwhile, was \"really sad\" it didn't work out \u2014 and \"pissed,\" too. The former couple met after a group hangout but did not reconcile.",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",

      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",

    "summary": "What are books by Black authors that have been banned? Read on for a list of banned books, why they were banned and what the authors have said.",
    "story": [
      "Book banning has increased across the country in recent years, according to data from two organizations dedicated to advocacy against censorship, but the practice of book banning in the United States dates back to the 1600s.",
      "The first known banned book was Thomas Morton's \"New English Canaan,\" a book published in 1637 that was banned by the Puritan government for its criticisms of their customs, according to a research guide from Harvard Graduate School of Education's Gutman Library. Outright bans enacted by the American government continued in the 1870s with the federal Comstock Act, which banned the distribution of writings that were \u201cobscene, lewd, or lascivious\u201d on the grounds of ensuring public morality.",
      "Today, book banning typically refers to the practice of removing or limiting access to materials from school or public libraries.",
      "Between 2022 and 2023, the American Library Association (ALA), a nonprofit that promotes the value of the library and librarians to the public, reported a 65% increase in the number of titles that were challenged for removal, marking a record high ever documented by the association.",
      "The trend has continued. From January to August 2024, the ALA tracked 414 attempts to limit access to more than 1,000 unique titles. PEN America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to free expression, meanwhile, reported more than 10,000 instances of book bans for the 2023-2024 school year.",
      "Book banning doesn\u2019t involve making materials completely unavailable for public consumption. Court cases have held that the First Amendment protects a \u201cright to receive information.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re saying that a book is being challenged in a community, and if the decision is made by the board to remove it, then they\u2019re saying that that\u2019s a ban on accessing that material through that library. But that doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s the only way that someone can access information,\u201d ALA President Cindy Hohl says.",
      "According to the ALA, a book ban occurs when material is removed from a library after a person or group objects to it. A ban is often initiated by a challenge, which refers to the attempt to remove it from public access.",
      "PEN America takes a broader approach, defining a school book ban as any action that results in access to a book being \"restricted or diminished, either temporarily or permanently.\"",
      "What both organizations share is the goal of tracking where access to books is being disrupted \u2014 a task that's easier said than done.",
      "\"We rely upon libraries and library professionals to report these matters directly to ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom,\" Hohl says. \"So we believe that there is a matter of under-reporting because many of the book challenges aren't even submitted to us or covered by the press.",
      "We continue to see this trend where (book bans are) specifically targeting Black, Indigenous, people of color, whether it's the author themselves, or it's the characters in the storyline... Who has the right to decide whose voice should have a place in American literature?",
      "cindy hohl",
      "\"When we look at the data that's compiled, it really only represents a snapshot of book censorship attempts,\" she adds.",
      "What the available data does show is that book banning disproportionately affects Black and Indigenous writers and authors of color, as well as authors from the LGBTQ+ community, Hohl says.",
      "Ranging from classics, including the works of James Baldwin and Toni Morrison, to modern young adult books like \"The Hate U Give\" and \"The Poet X,\" books by Black authors have been impacted by bans for decades.",
      "The censorship of diverse voices can also come about by individual people's choices \u2014 for example, unilateral censorship by a library worker, which the ALA defines as a librarian excluding materials for display or purchase \"without consulting anyone.\"",
      "Quartez Harris is the the author of \"Go Tell It,\" an illustrated biography of James Baldwin, whose works have been repeatedly banned across the U.S. He's also a former second-grade teacher. During his time as a teacher, while books weren't explicitly banned at his school, he says he witnessed what he calls \"quiet banning,\" or indirectly keeping books from readers.",
      "\"A lot of teachers didn't really feature books that reflected our students' lived experiences. We were a predominantly Black school, but a lot of the literature did not depict our demographic,\" Harris says.",
      "Book banning has also become just one part of \"more extreme\" attempts at censorship, Sonya Douglass, a professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, says. Classrooms around the country face challenges on what they can teach and the terminology used, she says. In 2021, school districts across the country faced battles over what can be taught about race and gender. Nine states enacted laws limiting instruction of critical race theory \u2014\u00a0a framework that looks at how racism is systemic \u2014 that year, per NBC News.",
      "\"(Book banning is) now, I think, even being overshadowed by a lot of the efforts to just limit the opportunity to teach about race, racism and the truth of American racism,\" Douglass says.",
      "A lot of teachers didn't really feature books that reflected my our students lived experiences. We were a predominantly Black school, but a lot of the literature did not depict our demographic.\u201d",
      "Quartez Harris",
      "Jewell Parker Rhodes, whose book \"Ghost Boys\" has faced bans, says the experience has been triggering.",
      "\"I have trauma from the banned books themselves,\" Rhodes says. \"I've been teaching African American literature for decades... When you lose the voice of the African American literature, you lose the voice of African American people.\"",
      "To push back against censorship, Harris encourages readers to \"challenge these baseless claims that books are harmful. Books make people better.\"",
      "Here are banned books by Black authors across genres to celebrate Black History Month all year-round.",
      "Classics",
      "\"The Color Purple\" by Alice Walker",
      "Alice Walker's 1982 epistolary novel tells the story of a young Black woman named Celie through the letters she writes to God about her experiences in early 1900s Georgia. \"The Color Purple\" has consistently made the American Library Association's list of most frequently challenged books, coming in at No. 17 for the 2000-2009 list and No. 50 for 2010-2019, primarily for its sexual and racial content.",
      "Walker, now 81, spoke about attempts to censor \"The Color Purple\" in a 2012 interview with Guernica magazine and said, \"I remember feeling, and understanding, the fear that drove some parents in the schools to wish to ban 'The Color Purple.'\"",
      "\"Many people of course condemned 'The Color Purple' unread. Some read the first five pages and decided they were doing society a service by silencing the voice of a 14-year-old uneducated Black girl whose only language was what she\u2019d heard in her community, where people rarely spoke in euphemisms,\" she continued.",
      "\"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison",
      "Toni Morrison is another author whose work often makes the ALA's list of frequently challenged books, including her classic titles \"The Bluest Eye\" (the No. 10 most frequently challenged book of 2010-2019) and \"Beloved\" (No. 26 on the same list). \"The Bluest Eye,\" which follows a young traumatized girl who wishes to have \"blue eyes,\" has been banned for its depiction of child abuse and focus on racism. \"Beloved,\" about a family of formerly enslaved people who are being haunted, has also been banned for its violent content. Morrison edited a 2009 anthology of essays about censorship called \"Burn this Book\" and wrote, \u201cFear of unmonitored writing is justified \u2014 because truth is trouble.\"",
      "Andrea Davis Pinkney, the author of children's books like \"The Red Pencil\" and \"Sit-In,\" also worked with Morrison to edit her children's books. Pinkney says Morrison taught that times of \"dread\" is \"the exact moment that artists need to get to work.\"",
      "\"This is the moment where we get on the path, we stay in the work, and we tell the stories, because that's what's gonna endure at the end of the day. That's what will last,\" she says of Morrison's wisdom. \"And you can't ban that.\"",
      "\"Native Son\" by Richard Wright",
      "Richard Wright\u2019s \"Native Son\" follows Bigger Thomas and the catastrophic chain of events that occur after he accidentally kills a white woman. While \"Native Son\" does not make light of Bigger\u2019s crimes, some of the book\u2019s wider themes explore the effects systemic racism may have had and the hypocrisy of the justice system. Although Wright\u2019s work is considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, it has been banned in multiple school districts for language, sexual content and violence.",
      "\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" by James Baldwin",
      "James Baldwin's \"Go Tell It On the Mountain\" is about a teenager's complex family dynamics and his relationship with the Pentecostal Church. The book has been banned at least twice for its profanity and sexual content, according to PEN America.",
      "Quartez Harris, the author of \"Go Tell It,\" a picture book biography of Baldwin that came out in January 2025, tells TODAY.com that reading the work of Baldwin allows readers to \"connect with other people's pain \u2014\u00a0his pain and the world's pain.\"",
      "\"He used language to figure out what was happening to him and what was happening in the world,\" Harris says.",
      "\"We're able to process our lived experiences through his work, but if we're censoring his work, if we're sanctioning his work, then you're limiting people from feeling celebrating, feeling seen, feeling validated, feeling liberated,\" he adds. \"And that's a deep concern.\"",
      "\"Invisible Man\" by Ralph Ellison",
      "Ralph Ellison's 1952 novel \"Invisible Man\" follows an unnamed Black man struggling with his identity in a world that sees him through a variety of predetermined lenses. It chronicles his teenage years to adulthood and the ways racism renders him \"invisible.\"",
      "In 2013, \"Invisible Man\" was banned from school libraries in a North Carolina county after a parent complained of its language, sexual content and \"lack of innocence,\" per the Los Angeles Times.",
      "\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" by Zora Neale Hurston",
      "\u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d is a classic novel of the Harlem Renaissance. It follows a young woman through her journey of finding love, stability and independence and asserting her own dignity amid a traumatic family history. \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" was banned in the '90s in Virginia for its language and sexual content.",
      "Children\u2019s and young adult books",
      "\"The Hate U Give\" by Angie Thomas",
      "Angie Thomas' 2017 young adult novel \"The Hate U Give\" follows a 16-year-old Black girl who witnesses her friend's death at the hands of a police officer. As she bends toward activism, it causes tension at her predominately white school. The book has been banned for its depiction of police and references to drugs and sex. \"The Hate U Give\" was adapted into a movie in 2018.",
      "Thomas spoke about book banning on a panel alongside George M. Johnson during the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in 2023. \u201cWe weren\u2019t writing to have a political agenda,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe were writing about experiences. We were writing about real people. I\u2019ve had 16-year-old white, rural Americans tell me, \u2018I didn\u2019t know any Black people. But this book helps me to learn things that Black people have gone through.\u2019\u201d",
      "\"My Princess Boy\" by Cheryl Kilodavis",
      "\"My Princess Boy\" is a children's picture book that published in 2009. The book is about a young boy who chooses to wear traditionally \"girly\" attire and receives support from his family. The picture book has faced several challenges on the grounds of its depiction of gender expression. In 2022, it was banned pending investigation in a Florida school district, per PEN America.",
      "\"The Poet X\" by Elizabeth Acevedo",
      "\"The Poet X\" is a coming of age novel-in-verse written by Elizabeth Acevedo. It follows Xiomara, or X, as she utilizes slam poetry to express her conflicting feelings on her religion, her sexuality and her place in the world as an Afro-Latina teen. Acevedo\u2019s book was challenged because Xiomara dared to question her religion, thus deeming it \"anti-Christian.\" It was also challenged for containing content relating to sexuality and race.",
      "Speaking to high school students in Washington, D.C. in January 2024, Acevedo said, per the American Federation of Teachers' website, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking themes. We\u2019re talking about people who exist in the world. We\u2019re talking about characters who exist; we are people. They\u2019re not banning these books to protect y\u2019all, because oftentimes these books are about y\u2019all. They\u2019re banning these books because they\u2019re saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want certain demographics of kids to know that other kinds of young people exist and that within their community, other kinds of people exist.'\"",
      "\"Monster\" by Walter Dean Myers",
      "\"Monster\" is a 1999 young adult novel about a 16-year-old on trial for murder. Written like a screenplay, the book interweaves the events of the trial with the protagonist's journal entries and memories of what happened. The book explores choices, racial discrimination and more, and it has been banned for its violence, language and mature content.",
      "\"Brown Girl Dreaming\" by Jacqueline Woodson",
      "\"Brown Girl Dreaming\" is a memoir written for teens about author Jacqueline Woodson's experience growing up across the US in the late 1960s. The book, which is written in verse, explores Woodson's upbringing in the context of religion, the Civil Rights movement, the culture of the South and more. The author told Lit Hub her book was on banned book lists in Florida and Texas.",
      "\"To come into this art, wanting to create stories that were not there when I was a young person and wanting no other young person to feel themselves invisible in this world? The attempt at erasure is heartbreaking to me. It\u2019s not even about me, it\u2019s about the young people that don\u2019t get to see themselves,\" Woodson told Lit Hub in December 2024.",
      "\"Ghost Boys\" by Jewell Parker Rhodes",
      "\"Ghost Boys,\" Jewell Parker Rhodes' 2018 middle-grade novel, follows a young Black student, Jerome, who is shot by a white policeman who mistook a play gun for a weapon. Jerome returns in the story as a ghost and meets other \"ghost boys,\" including Emmett Till. The book was temporarily banned in Florida for its depiction of police.",
      "Rhodes says she wrote \"Ghost Boys\" while \"loving\" all her characters, including the policeman. She says her goal is to spark discussions over if unconscious bias or racism was an aspect of the shooting.",
      "Rhodes, whose latest book, \u201cWill\u2019s Race For Home,\u201d published in January 2025, says, \u201cWhen you have books banned from a classroom, it\u2019s like saying you want to render all the kids of color invisible. That their experiences aren\u2019t worth talking about.\u201d",
      "Nonfiction",
      "\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" by Malcolm X, Alex Haley",
      "\u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X\u201d published in 1965, shortly  after Malcolm X was assassinated. The book was the product of interviews between Alex Haley and the civil rights activist and took a deep dive on Malcolm X\u2019s philosophies. The book has faced calls for bans for years, dating back to 1993, for its discussion of race relations. Another work by Haley, \u201cRoots: The Saga of An American Family,\u201d was also notably banned for the first time during the 2023-24 school year, according to PEN America.",
      "\"The New Jim Crow\" by Michelle Alexander",
      "\"The New Jim Crow\" is a 2010 nonfiction book about racial discrimination and mass incarceration, comparing the latter to a modern \"Jim Crow\" system. Key points involve analyzing enforcement of the War of Drugs and the disproportionate rates of imprisonment among Black men. In 2018, \"The New Jim Crow\" was banned in prisons in New Jersey, per the ACLU.",
      "\"Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents\" by Isabel Wilkerson",
      "\u201cCaste\u201d by journalist Isabel Wilkerson argues that racism in the US is an example of a caste system and dives into the consequences of it. The book inspired the film \u201cOrigin,\u201d which stars Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor as Wilkerson and follows the research process for the book. \u201cCaste\u201d faced a ban in Texas, and, according to a 2022 report from the Washington Post, the book \u201cmysteriously vanished\u201d from shelves.",
      "Speaking with Oprah Daily in 2023, Wilkerson said, \u201cThese bans only affirm the forewarnings in the book. We\u2019re in a period of backlash and retrenchment, which the book attests to and foreshadows. The only thing I can do is to keep pressing forward in my work, knowing that we can\u2019t run from history and that the truth will win out in the end.\u201d",
      "\"Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You\" by Jason Reynolds and Ibram X. Kendi",

Kendi\u2019s \"Stamped\" is a nonfiction book that explores how anti-Black racist ideas were conceived and became rooted in America\u2019s history. \"Stamped\" has produced multiple children\u2019s \u201cremixes,\" a graphic novel, and a Netflix documentary. In 2020, the \u201cremix,\" \"Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You,\" was named the second-most challenged book by the ALA. The book was banned and challenged because of the author\u2019s \u201cpublic statements, claims that the book contains \u2018selective storytelling incidents,\u2019 and does not encompass racism against all people.\"",
      "\u201cBook bans aim to suppress critical thinking, suppress the factual record, suppress the historical record, suppress a multiplicity of experiences and perspectives, and suppress our recognition of racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry,\u201d Kendi has said, according to a 2024 news release from PEN America. \u201cBy challenging these bans, we\u2019re not just defending books\u2014we\u2019re defending against well-funded and well-organized efforts to control our minds. Censorship is about control. I am not about to let anyone control my mind or yours.\u201d",

      "\"The Hill We Climb\" by Amanda Gorman",
      "Amanda Gorman\u2019s poem \u201cThe Hill We Climb\u201d made waves after she read it aloud at Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration in January 2021. The poem was restricted \u2014 meaning access to the poem was limited \u2014 in 2023 at a school in Florida after a parent complaint.",
      "\u201cThese books that are being banned predominantly feature authors and characters of color, authors and characters of the LGBTQ community, and so we\u2019re seeing entire identities erased from bookshelves. And when a child can\u2019t see themselves represented in a story, they can\u2019t dream of their own life, to actualize their own hopes,\u201d Gorman said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in February, during an interview about her new book, \u201cGirls on the Rise.\u201d",
      "\"All Boys Aren't Blue\" by George M. Johnson",
      "In \"All Boys Aren\u2019t Blue,\" a debut young adult memoir-manifesto, George M. Johnson chronicles their coming of age as a queer Black child through a series of essays. Johnson\u2019s book serves as an exploration of Johnson\u2019s identity, while encouraging readers to  find their own truth. Because Johnson\u2019s book was deemed sexually explicit and has LGBTQ+ themes, it\u2019s currently one of the most banned books in the country.",
      "At the 2023 Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, Johnson said they believe efforts to ban books stem from fear of Gen Z-led change and that they plan to keep creating.",
      "\u201cMy philosophy has been, \u2018Well they can\u2019t ban all the damn books,\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo I keep writing.\u201d",

The project won Hannah-Jones the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2020 and led to a Hulu docuseries, podcast and picture book.",

    "story": [
      "Zoe Salda\u00f1a and her husband, Marco Perego, are the parents of three boys: Cy Aridio, Bowie Ezio and Zen Anton Hilario.",
      "The couple has never been afraid to take a less traditional path since getting married in 2013. Perego decided to take Salda\u00f1a's name, a move that created a bit of a buzz.",
      "Salda\u00f1a addressed the chatter in a Facebook post in 2015, writing that although she had a moment of \"hesitation\" when he shared his intention to become Marco Perego-Salda\u00f1a, she said, \"Why is it so surprising, shocking, eventful that a man would take his wife\u2019s surname? Women have never been asked if it's OK for them to give up their names....I know our sons will respect and admire their father more because their father led by example.\"",
      "The couple is raising three boys, and when TODAY.com asked Salda\u00f1a if she wanted a daughter back in 2018, she said, \u201cNow that I have the three boys, I can\u2019t really picture myself with anything else.\u201d Salda\u00f1a and her husband say they are trying to raise the boys in a \u201cgender-fluid environment.\u201d",
      "She told TODAY, \u201cOur mission is to raise decent, amazing, compassionate men who will then pick partners \u2014 whether they\u2019re females or males \u2014 that will pick partners and hopefully I\u2019ll get to have the daughters later (as a grandmother). But I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing out.\u201d",
      "Identical twins Cy Aridio and Bowie Ezio",
      "Cy and his twin brother Bowie arrived 8 weeks early in November 2014.",
      "Salda\u00f1a's health had begun to deteriorate two months prior, and ultimately, the boys were born via C-section while Salda\u00f1a was under general anesthetic. She wasn't able to meet them until the following day.",
      "As the kids got older, Salda\u00f1a decided to use her day job to her advantage. While playing green-skinned Gamora in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\u201d Salda\u00f1a convinced the twins that she was related to the Hulk, which scared the boys into eating their vegetables.",
      "According to \u201cPeople,\u201d Salda\u00f1a says the twins are inseparable: \u201cThey sleep at the same time, they eat at the same time, they poop at the same time.\u201d",
      "Zen Anton Hilario",
      "Salda\u00f1a announced the birth of her third son, Zen Anton Hilario, with a super sweet Instagram post featuring all three boys.",
      "Zen arrived in December 2016, and in a birthday post, Saldana wrote: \u201cYou came into our lives in the most \u2018zen\u2019 way, and today you still continue to be our little Yogi baby. Your Joie de Vie keeps all of us wrapped around your little finger.\u201d",
      "Adding a third child certainly ups the level of chaos, but Salda\u00f1a seems to take it in stride, traveling, cooking, exploring and enjoying every hilarious moment.",
      "Earlier this year, she wrote on Instagram to her boys: \u201cBeing your mother is such a treat. The laughs, the jokes, the\u00a0@lego\u00a0pieces everywhere, the brawls, the meltdowns, the milestones that ache so deeply, the achievements that make our hearts burst\u2026 everything about you is meant to be just as it is. Stay wild, pure and free.\u201d"

      "Mendoza said during the press conference the dogs had access to a dog door, so they were able to go in and out of the home. The dog that was found dead was in a kennel or a crate, Mendoza said.",
      "How did Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa die?",
      "How Hackman and Arakawa died remains unclear at the time as the investigation is active and ongoing.",
      "As of Feb. 28, the cause of death has not been determined, but Mendoza said there are no signs of external trauma to either of them. The Santa Fe Sheriff\u2019s Department had previously said in a statement to NBC News that no foul play was suspected. However, Mendoza said investigators were \u201cnot ruling it out.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s likely that Hackman\u2019s \u201clast day of life\u201d was Feb. 17, according to Mendoza.",

      "At this time, it's unknown when the cause and the manner of death will officially be determined, or when the toxicology results will come in. \u201cIt could be months or three months or longer,\u201d Mendoza said, adding that several tests were submitted to be expedited.",
      "Could they have died from carbon monoxide poisoning?",
      "Deputies told investigators that the Santa Fe City Fire Department responded to the scene to conduct testing to determine if there were signs of a possible carbon monoxide leak. Firefighters did not locate signs of a leak or poisoning, according to the warrant.",
      "The New Mexico Gas Company also responded to the scene, and no signs or evidence indicating there were any problems associated with the home\u2019s pipes were found, according to the warrant.",
      "While the official results of the autopsy and toxicology reports are pending, Mendoza said on Feb. 28 that both individuals tested negative for carbon monoxide.",
      "What else has the investigation discovered so far?",
      "Deputies told investigators that after searching the rest of the property, all other buildings were locked and secured. There did not appear to be any signs of forced entry, or that anything was out of place or taken, deputies said.",
      "The warrant requested to search for materials throughout the home that could assist with the determination and cause of death, as the investigators found the \u201ccircumstances surrounding the death of the two deceased individuals to be suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.\u201d",
      "Mendoza said during the Feb. 28 press conference that according to the search warrant,  two green cell phones, two bottles of medication, one bottle of over-the-counter Tylenol, medical records and a 2025 monthly planner calendar were secured from the residence for evidentiary purposes.",
      "Investigators will now analyze the cell phone data, calls, texts, events and photos in the cell phones to piece together a timeline, he said.",
      "Additionally, Mendoza said, \u201cthe Santa Fe Animal Control division worked with family to ensure the safety of their two surviving dogs.\u201d"

Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\"",
      "Sam Asghari",
      "Episode 9 began with the remaining Traitors, once again, butting heads about the next murder. They ultimately agreed that murdering Sam would be the best move. They pointed out that he was improving at picking up on suspicious behavior and that other Faithfuls were starting to listen to him. When the actor learned his stint on the show was over, he was unsurprised. \"Alright, my time has come to an end,\" he said. \"I was sort of expecting this. I had some good ideas around the roundtable. I was getting good at it and the only way to get me out of the castle was to murder me.\" He said he was leaving with no regrets. \"I've played with honor, respect, I got to know people, and I got to have fun. So I wouldn't change one thing.\"",
      "Carolyn Wiger",
      "Carolyn's run as the most undetected Traitor in the game came to a dramatic end in Episode 9. Throughout the episode, Carolyn started to hint to other players that they shouldn't trust her fellow Traitor Danielle. Meanwhile, Danielle was secretly plotting to expose Carolyn as a Traitor. In the chess game mission, Danielle took a back seat while Carolyn was vocal, making the other players think for the first time that something was off. Then at the roundtable, Danielle showed off her convincing debate skills. She called Carolyn out for attacking her in a previous episode, noting that eliminated Traitors were very aggressive at the roundtable. Carolyn attempted to create a counter argument but was unsuccessful. After getting voted out, she tearfully approached the circle of truth and said, \"I'm somebody who, every day of my life, am judged because of who I am, my differences, my quirks.\" She revealed that she avoided building connections because of how emotional she is. \"Playing this game, it's not easy for me,\" she continued. \"I just wanted to have fun! But I have to get real with myself. Being a Traitor isn't fun.\"",
      "Tom Sandoval",
      "Episode 10 began with the sole remaining Traitor successfully recruiting a new ally before the two secretly escaped to the turret to weigh their options for the next murder. They agreed that Tom Sandoval was close to figuring out their identities and needed to go. When the \"Vanderpump Rules\" star spotted a letter from the Traitors, he immediately let out a maniacal chuckle. \"I knew it!\" he said before reading that he had been eliminated from the game. \"I was expecting this. Who's the most threatening of the guys? Obviously me,\" he theorized. He added, \"I've enjoyed this so much and I didn't realize I was going to be so good at it. It's kind of f---ing cool.\" Tom then applauded himself for how he played the game and how the other players perceived him. \"Overall, I was a pleasure to work with, for the most part, and valued, respected and that's all I could ask for,\" he concluded."

      "Israel has not separately confirmed the latest developments in its negotiations with Hamas, and did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "Talks on the second phase were set to begin weeks ago. In January, during the initial announcement of the agreement, then-President Joe Biden said the ceasefire would continue even after six weeks \u201cas long as the negotiations continue.\u201d",
      "The second phase of the ceasefire would have seen the release of additional hostages and prisoners, mark the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and ultimately lead to a permanent end to the war.",
      "The U.S., Egypt and Qatar \u2014 the three countries that helped mediate the deal \u2014 continue to act as guarantors of the agreement.",
      "Amid concerns around the truce, the Pentagon said Friday that the U.S. State Department had approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs and other weaponry to Israel on an emergency basis. The sale marked the second time the Trump administration declared an emergency to approve weapons sales to Israel since last month.",
      "The fragile ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on Jan. 19, halted months of fighting and allowed the exchange of 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",

On Thursday, Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, told NBC News that the militant group would be willing to cede political and administrative power in the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but would not disarm until an independent Palestinian state is achieved.",

      "\u201cWe are ready today, if not yesterday, to step back from governance to hand it over to a body, a government, a committee, that is ready to run the Gaza Strip,\u201d Naim said.",
      "Naim made his comments during a critical impasse: The first phase of a tenuous deal between Hamas and Israel is set to end on Saturday, and no arrangements have been made for continuing the ceasefire.",
      "While there have been few publicly acknowledged negotiations to extend the truce into a second phase, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it will soon send a diplomatic delegation to Cairo to continue talks.",
      "Naim said that beyond that public announcement, Hamas had not been officially notified of Israel's intention to resume negotiations.",
      "It was unclear whether Israeli officials would seek to extend the first phase of the agreement or negotiate terms for a second phase, which could ultimately lead to a more permanent ceasefire and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Naim said Israel was deliberately delaying further negotiations to create a pretext for returning to war against Hamas.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is intentionally done to escalate the situation or to push the second-phase negotiations under the threat to return back to war and not to withdraw from the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli troops are supposed to start withdrawing from the Gaza-Egypt border area on Saturday, marking the end of the ceasefire's first phase. However, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan on Thursday that Israel has demanded that their military stay in the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "The last step of the agreement\u2019s six-week first phase came overnight, when Israel released more than 600 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas handed over the corpses of four Israeli hostages killed during captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms \u2014 which were reached with help from intermediaries Qatar and Egypt in late January, after more than a year of fraught negotiations \u2014 talks on the second stage should have begun weeks ago.",
      "But rather than returning to the negotiating table, each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement\u2019s terms. Several of the weekly exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners have been dogged by last-minute accusations and near-cancellations.",
      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "The thorniest question standing in the way of negotiating the second phase of an agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared Hamas\u2019 destruction as the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 sometimes, his critics have said, superseding the freedom and welfare of the Israeli hostages still being held there.",
      "Though he reiterated Hamas\u2019 offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, Basem Naim said the group would only disarm and transform into a purely political party if Palestinians are granted an independent political state \u2014 a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in government have repeatedly rejected.",
      "\u201cThese are two different tracks. The arms are related to the existence or the presence of the occupation,\u201d he said, referring to Israel's ongoing presence in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.",
      "If an independent Palestinian state is created, Naim said, \u201cwe are ready again to become a political party and to integrate our fighters into a Palestinian national army.\u201d",
      "Israeli military leaders have repeatedly made clear that they are prepared to return to war if the agreement collapses, going so far as to call up reservists for renewed fighting.",
      "Though Hamas remains committed to the ceasefire agreement, Naim said, the group is also preparing for renewed fighting.",
      "\u201cIf they decide to escalate and to return back to war, we are preparing ourselves for all options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice other than to defend ourselves, as we have done already along the 15 months.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group\u2019s intentions and underestimated its capabilities.",
      "The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack, which triggered\u00a0the war in Gaza.",
      "Many Israelis believe the mistakes of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military, and they blame Netanyahu for what they view as a failed strategy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That strategy included allowing Qatar to send\u00a0suitcases of cash\u00a0into Gaza and sidelining Hamas\u2019 rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.",
      "The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire.\u00a0Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry.",
      "The military\u2019s main findings were that the region\u2019s most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas\u2019 intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday.",
      "The military\u2019s findings are\u00a0in line with past conclusions\u00a0reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was a complete failure,\u201d said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found.",
      "The military also misjudged the militant group\u2019s capabilities. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes.",
      "Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said.",
      "The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to the Israeli network.",
      "The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017.",
      "With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border.",
      "From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military\u2019s command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a\u00a0music festival\u00a0with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure.",
      "It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants.",
      "According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals.",
      "Some high-ranking officers\u00a0have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel\u2019s top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there is \u201cvalue\u201d in an agreement that President Donald Trump is pursuing on Ukrainian mineral rights to repay some of the $500 billion in military aid that the U.S. has sent in support of the country's war against Russia.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss efforts at ending the Russia-Ukraine war and a possible trade deal with the U.S., said in an interview with NBC News that economic ties between Washington and Kyiv could be considered a form of security.",

But I can see very clearly the argument that President Trump makes in relation to minerals, and I can also see the validity of his points when he says that if there is a deal on minerals then the U.S. has economic interests in Ukraine, which, if you like, form at least one element of any security guarantee.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat, in its own right, is an important aspect.\u201d",
      "Trump has been vocal about his interest in settling the yearslong conflict in Ukraine and talked about compensation for the billions of dollars in aid that Washington has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. But he has shied away from committing to any security guarantees, saying this week that he would ask Europe to take the lead on that.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump warned that if a peace deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody wants peace, everybody wants bloodshed to end. Not least the Ukrainians,\u201d Starmer told NBC News, adding that discussions were already underway on what security would look like.",
      "Asked if Britain can achieve its objectives without U.S. participation, Starmer responded that \u201cthe first thing is to get the European element in place.\u201d",
      "He said Trump \u201cis right\u201d to press for talks to drive forward a deal, while adding words of caution about Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that we know, historically, that Putin might go again,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cHe has ambitions in relation to Ukraine. And therefore, if there\u2019s to be a deal, it has got to be a deal that lasts.\u201d",
      "The Starmer-Trump meeting comes at a sensitive time for the United Kingdom as the prime minister commits to sending British troops to Ukraine to help secure a \u201clasting peace\u201d if a peace deal with Russia is reached.\u201cThe stakes, they couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Starmer said during a joint news conference with Trump at the White House. He said it was essential that Ukraine be \u201cbacked by strength that will stop Putin coming back for more.\u201d",
      "Starmer, standing beside Trump, insisted that any deal should put to rest Russian ambitions and committed to putting \u201cboots on the ground and planes in the sky\u201d to limit future incursions into Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump offered praise to Starmer, greeting him warmly at several junctures throughout the day. The two leaders held a bilateral meeting and continued their discussions on Ukraine and a possible trade deal over lunch, Trump said during the news conference.",
      "Starmer is a \u201cspecial man,\u201d Trump said, adding that they \u201cget along famously.\u201d",
      "The meeting came a day before the president is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in Washington, as Trump hopes the U.S and Ukraine can sign an agreement on rare mineral rights.",

      "\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this deeply unnerved even our closest allies in Asia,\u201d said Green, who served on the White House National Security Council under President George W. Bush.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive dismantling of the U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid has had ripple effects abroad, according to Green. U.S. embassies are hampered by the chaos in Washington and funding for democracy programs has dried up, a potential boon for China, he said.",
      "\u201cSenior officials in Japan, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand have told me that China is swooping in, offering to replace the United States as the partner of choice,\u201d Green said.",

      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s America First approach to diplomacy prioritizes what\u2019s in the best interest of the United States,\u201d said Brian Hughes, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration will continue to engage our allies and partners to improve burden-sharing measures for defense spending, rebalancing trade deficits and ensuring global adversaries do not take advantage of America as they did under Biden,\u201d Hughes added.",
      "But for Europe, there is now a grim determination to prepare for a future without America at its side.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the presumptive next chancellor of Germany after the country\u2019s parliamentary elections Sunday, said it was unclear if the NATO alliance would survive.",

      "Millions of people around the world are today feeling the repercussions of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to freeze international aid for 90 days and shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, by far the largest provider of foreign assistance around the world.",
      "From biosecurity and vaccines for viruses such as polio, mpox and Ebola, to food supplies for famine-stricken countries and essential treatment for people living with HIV, a vast number of programs around the world have been hit by the decision, current and former USAID workers told NBC News.",
      "\u201cProbably we have lost lives,\u201d Marcia Wong, who served as deputy assistant administrator of USAID\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance under the Biden administration, said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "Everybody interviewed for this article spoke to NBC News before the Trump administration said Sunday that it was eliminating 2,000 positions at USAID, and placing all but a fraction of other staffers on leave.",
      "Here, NBC News looks at the broad impact the pause on foreign aid has had and what is at stake.",
      "Life-threatening cuts",
      "According to the government website ForeignAssistance.gov, the U.S. disbursed around $72 billion in foreign aid in the year ending Sept. 20, 2023 \u2014 the latest year with up-to-date data. USAID, which for decades has served as the country\u2019s primary foreign aid agency, managed around $44 billion in global assistance that fiscal year, disbursing that money to aid programs and operations in 160 countries and regions around the world.",
      "After Trump signed an executive order Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, American-funded aid and development programs worldwide were forced to scale back, shut down and lay off staff."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The \u201cwanted\u201d posters were sent by mail, arriving at the homes of Carmen Lau\u2019s neighbors in the town of Maidenhead.",
      "The alleged crime? Speaking out about China\u2019s rule in Hong Kong, where Lau has not lived since 2021.",
      "Provide information about Lau to the Hong Kong Police Force, urged the poster, folded into envelopes with Hong Kong stamps, or \u201ctake her to the Chinese embassy.\u201d",
      "The reward: 1 million Hong Kong dollars, or $130,000.",
      "The flyers that arrived in this town 7 miles from Windsor Castle are the latest threat directed at Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy diaspora, who have fled the city trying to escape the long arm of Chinese law, only to find that harassment can cross borders.",
      "Lau, who spoke to NBC News from outside the U.K. on Friday, said she did not \u201cfeel safe living at my current address,\u201d and was now weighing temporary residence options elsewhere. (NBC News is not disclosing Lau\u2019s current location for her safety.)",
      "Joshua Reynolds, Maidenhead\u2019s MP, says at least five people reported receiving the letters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unsure what to do about it, they\u2019re unsure why they received it, or what was going on,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Friday, adding that he had called Lau about them.",
      "Reynolds showed NBC News three identical posters that included Lau\u2019s headshot and information including an address, date of birth, ethnicity, build and height. Reynolds said he knows of at least one other Hong Kong activist whose neighbors have received similar letters.",
      "\u201cA reward of one million Hong Kong dollars is being offered by Hong Kong Police to any member of the public, who can provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to the Chinese embassy,\u201d it reads.",
      "Those with information should contact an email address or the Hong Kong Police Force\u2019s\u00a0British WhatsApp number, it says.",
      "\u201cThe bounty is because they want to silence us and they want to instill fear among our diaspora,\u201d said Lau, who fled Hong Kong in 2021 after the former British colony enacted a sweeping and vaguely worded national security law that gave the government more power to quash dissent.",
      "The law followed a political crackdown triggered by Hong Kong\u2019s 2019 pro-democracy protests. It threatens stringent penalties for a wide range of actions authorities call threats to national security, with the most severe \u2014 including treason and insurrection \u2014 punishable by life imprisonment. Lesser offenses, including the possession of seditious publications, could also lead to several years in jail.",
      "Lau was declared a criminal by police after she fled Hong Kong. The city\u2019s police placed the bounty on her after accusing her of violating the national security law and calling for her return.",
      "She said Hong Kong police had taken her relatives in for questioning twice this month. NBC News could not confirm her account.",
      "Calling the posters \u201cawful,\u201d Reynolds said it was \u201cjust not acceptable\u201d if it was true the flyers had been sent from China.",
      "It was not clear who sent the posters. A spokesperson from Hong Kong\u2019s government said it would \u201cnot issue any anonymous letter\u201d but that it \u201cwill definitely pursue\u201d those who had fled the territory \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201ctake every measure\u201d to bring them back.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in London did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Anonymous harassment has also been an issue within Hong Kong. In September, the Hong Kong Journalists Association said people from dozens of media outlets had received threatening messages in a \u201csystematic and organized\u201d campaign, calling it the largest-scale harassment of reporters it had ever seen.",
      "This is not the first time concerns have been raised about the safety of Hong Kong democracy activists living in Britain, which took in more than 120,000 people from its former colony in response to the national security law.",
      "Last May, British authorities charged three men, including the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London, with surveilling and gathering intelligence against Hong Kong democracy activists.",
      "Later that month, one of the men, Matthew Trickett, was found dead in a park, also in Maidenhead. Two other men, Chung Biu Yuen and Chi Leung Peter Wai, will go on trial next month. They deny the charges, which include breaking into a residence.",
      "Chinese officials have called the charges \u201cgroundless and slanderous.\u201d",
      "Reynolds, Maidenhead\u2019s MP, said residents in the town were \u201cconcerned that this looks like the Chinese are trying to interfere in the U.K., and that they don\u2019t want to be frightened by what\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "He added that police had told him they were making sure Lau \u201cgets the protection and security she requires.\u201d",
      "Thames Valley Police did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",

      "The plan has also been criticized by U.S. lawmakers, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., and Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., both of whom serve on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. In an open letter Wednesday, they said a Chinese Embassy of that scale would \u201conly embolden its efforts to intimidate and harass UK citizens and dissidents and experts across Europe.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Twice in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, a Norwegian lawmaker stepped forward to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Now, when Christian Tybring-Gjedde watches Trump maneuver to stop the war between Ukraine and Russia, he doesn\u2019t see the same sort of diplomatic outreach that warrants a third.",
      "\u201cHe is dictating terms that the Europeans are very scared of and are really worried about what\u2019s going to come of this,\u201d Tybring-Gjedde said in an interview. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the prospect of a Nobel Peace Prize. But you never know.\u201d",
      "A peace deal looks more elusive now than at any point since Trump\u2019s return to power. His meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned dark, with Trump browbeating his counterpart for not being grateful enough for U.S. firepower that helped repel Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Negotiations with Ukraine appear to have collapsed for now, jeopardizing Trump\u2019s pledge to bring a quick end to the war \u2014 and perhaps spoiling his best shot at winning an award that has been on his mind for years.",
      "Four American presidents have won the Nobel Peace Prize, none named Trump. That missing piece of the resume grates on him, former aides say, as was evident during his meeting in the Oval Office last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cThey will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Trump said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about the award. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me.\u201d",
      "If not, it won\u2019t be for lack of trying.",
      "In the space of a few days last week, no fewer than three senior Trump administration officials or nominees made a case for Trump winning the prize, using similar talking points.",
      "Unprompted, both Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Rep. Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican nominated to be ambassador to the United Nations, told conservative activists that Trump is a president \u201cof peace\u201d who deserves the award.",
      "\u201cHe is going to end the war in Europe. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East,\u201d Waltz told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "\u201cAnd you know what?\u201d he added. \u201cBy the end of this, we\u2019re going to have the Nobel Peace Prize sitting next to the name of Donald J. Trump.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also mentioned the prize during an interview with Fox News. Without prompting, Bessent said Trump\u2019s plan to end the conflict between Ukraine and Russia merits the honor. If \u201cfairly awarded,\u201d he added, \u201cI think in a year he should get it from what I\u2019ve seen.\u201d",
      "The odds are tough and may hinge on the particulars of a truce between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 if there is one.",
      "Fears have risen in recent weeks that Trump will use his leverage to end the war on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s terms. His rhetoric has grown discernibly more hostile to Ukraine.",
      "Even before the angry meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, he called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and suggested that Ukraine instigated the war.",
      "Now, Trump\u2019s anger has spilled into public view. As Zelenskyy sat with arms folded, Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded him like they would a disobedient schoolboy.",
      "\u201cHave you said \u2018thank you\u2019 once in this entire meeting?\u201d Vance said to Zelenskyy.",
      "In a testy tone, Trump told the Ukrainian leader, \u201cYou\u2019re either going to make a deal or we\u2019re out. And if we\u2019re out, you\u2019ll fight it out. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be pretty, but you\u2019ll fight it out. But you don\u2019t have the cards.\u201d",
      "At one point, Trump suggested he had bonded with Putin during his first term over what he called a \u201cphony witch hunt\u201d involving investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "\u201cLet me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Afterward, the White House canceled a side-by-side news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, who was told to leave the building. He\u2019s not welcome back, Trump later said in a statement, until he is \u201cready for Peace\u201d",
      "If Trump forges an agreement that\u2019s favorable to Russia while leaving the rest of Europe vulnerable to Putin\u2019s aggression, that might sour any prospect of winning the prize. A pro-Russia deal may not sit well with the Nobel selection committee, whose five members are appointed by the Norwegian parliament.",
      "\u201cIn Norway, we are bordering on Russia. This is very tough for all of us, because we are the ones who will be in jeopardy if Russia keeps on taking territory,\u201d said Tybring-Gjedde, a member of Norway\u2019s parliament serving on the defense and foreign affairs committees.",
      "The National Security Council did not return a request for comment for this article.",
      "\u2018They probably will never give it to me\u2019",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize became a running subplot of Trump\u2019s first term. At times he sounded captivated by the award.",
      "At a future farmers event in Indianapolis in 2018, Trump mentioned a previous American winner who had died nine years earlier, Norman Borlaug, a plant scientist who had helped combat global famine.",
      "While praising Borlaug, he said: \u201cCan you believe it?\u00a0He won the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey probably will never give it to me, even what I\u2019m doing in Korea, and in Idlib province and all of these places,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThey probably will never give it to me.\u00a0You know why?\u00a0Because they don\u2019t want to.\u201d",
      "Trump had two real shots at winning one back then: his efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons (that didn\u2019t happen) and to normalize relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors (that one did).",
      "In September 2020, Tybring-Gjedde nominated him for the Middle East peace deal known as the Abraham Accords, though when the winners were announced the following year, Trump was skunked.",
      "Co-winners Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov were journalists who had exposed abuses of power in the Philippines and Russia, respectively.",
      "Even the nomination was something the White House chose to celebrate. The White House press office released a statement drawing attention it. Campaigning for re-election in Ohio that month, Trump complained that the press hadn\u2019t paid enough to attention to the nomination, though having one\u2019s name put forward isn\u2019t necessarily a rare distinction.",
      "The list of people allowed to nominate someone is long. Quite long.",
      "Any member of a national legislature can put someone\u2019s name before the selection committee. (Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., nominated Trump last year). So can Cabinet ministers and heads of state (Japan\u2019s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated Trump for the 2019 prize). And university professors. And retired university professors. And someone serving on the board of directors of an organization that once won the prize. And anyone who advised the Nobel Committee in the past.",
      "Since Trump ran his first winning presidential campaign in 2016, an average of 323 people or groups a year have been nominated for the prize. That\u2019s enough to fill the rosters of six NFL teams.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. One topic they discussed was whether Trump would impose tariffs on Britain.",
      "If Starmer wants to ingratiate himself with Trump, there\u2019s an easy way to do it, said John Bolton, the White House national security adviser in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cPeople say, \u2018What would you recommend Starmer do?\u2019 and I said I would recommend that he nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Bolton said in an interview.",
      "Trump, he added, \u201cis definitely obsessed with it.\u201d",
      "A look at some previous winners suggests that Trump would be something of an anomaly if he\u2019s chosen. He\u2019s out of step with a few of the past winners.",
      "In 2012, the prize went to the European Union. At his first Cabinet meeting, held this week, Trump said he\u2019d soon be placing a 25% tariff on goods from the E.U., an institution he said was \u201cformed in order to screw the United States.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s allies say he has reason to be peeved. The last president to win the award was Barack Obama, who got it just nine months into his presidency, before he had notched any real achievements. Even Obama acknowledged in his acceptance speech that his accomplishments were \u201cslight.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the fair question to ask is, would Barack Obama have won for helping bring an end to the war\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, Mick Mulvaney, a former Trump White House chief of staff, said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think we all know the answer to that question.\u201d",
      "The makeup of the Nobel selection committee could impede whatever chance Trump might have. Winners aren\u2019t chosen based on isolated actions. A candidate\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d also comes into play.",
      "\u201cI will only remind you that any candidate for any Nobel Prize must have given a contribution to the greatest benefit of humankind,\u201d Berit Reiss-Andersen, a former chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told NBC News.",
      "The committee\u2019s new chairman, J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, is also secretary-general of PEN Norway, a group whose mission includes supporting free expression and \u201cwriters at risk.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not the career path of a MAGA enthusiast. Trump has faced criticism over his treatment of U.S. journalists on free speech grounds. One of his early actions has been to bar The Associated Press wire service from Air Force One and certain events in which only a small group of \u201cpool\u201d reporters are allowed to watch and ask questions.",
      "The punishment stems from the AP\u2019s decision to stick with the name \u201cGulf of Mexico,\u201d while noting that Trump has renamed it the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP has filed suit to have its access restored.",
      "Elite recognition",
      "Why would Trump care about the prize? He rode to power as a populist who disdains the elite. Yet the Nobel Peace Prize brims with elite validation.",
      "That\u2019s the duality. Trump may be allied with the MAGA movement, but some part of him seems to pine for elite recognition. He often mentions an uncle who taught at the prestigious MIT. When Pete Hegseth struggled to win Senate confirmation, Trump vouched for him in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d by mentioning that Hegseth had gone to Ivy League schools.",
      "But envy may play a role, as well. Obama\u2019s prize was a sore point for Trump, said Bolton and another former senior White House official from the first term.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with the fact that Mr. Obama got it and he didn\u2019t,\u201d the ex-official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely."

      "The Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of $60 billion in U.S. Agency for International Development contracts is already unraveling significant programs and caused profound harm to many of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, humanitarian officials tell NBC News.",
      "The pace of change has jumped since Wednesday, when the White House unveiled plans to cut more than 90% of contracts held by USAID, which has been the world\u2019s largest single aid provider for decades. In January, an official freeze on foreign aid was cast as part of a temporary review.",
      "The recently announced cuts essentially eliminate most U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad and come amid the dramatic contraction of government spending carried out under the aegis of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. President Donald Trump and Musk allege that USAID promotes a liberal agenda and wastes money.",
      "Some of the programs at risk support drought-prone populations in Africa, school feeding programs in West Africa, outreach to youth at risk of recruitment to extremist organizations like the Islamic State group, and public health efforts focused on HIV/AIDS, according to multiple officials familiar with the cuts.",
      "Several representatives for nongovernmental organizations that have been affected by the USAID cuts requested anonymity to speak to NBC News while they determined how to best work with the Trump administration and dealt with the devastating directive. One spokesperson said they were afraid they could lose funding for the few remaining programs that weren\u2019t hit by Wednesday\u2019s cuts while another hoped the administration would reconsider the cuts altogether.",
      "UNAIDS, the joint United Nations program responding to HIV/AIDS globally, on Friday said it had received a letter from the administration terminating funding with immediate effect. The U.S. has been the leading contributor through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known at PEPFAR, which has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives in 55 countries since its creation in 2003, according to UNAIDS.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. funding cuts are dismantling the system,\u201d International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cHIV treatment is crumbling. TB services are collapsing. No data means no tracking of who\u2019s in care. No counsellors, no HIV testing \u2014 even in hospitals. No outreach means people fall through the cracks. Services for the most vulnerable people, including mobile clinics and drop-in centres, are shut down. Lives are on the line.\u201d",
      "Organizations combating gender-based violence are also feeling immediate impact. The International Rescue Committee, which supports civilians impacted by humanitarian crises around the world, including by providing medical care, counseling and legal assistance to thousands in war-torn Sudan, has been forced to shut down some of its operations, according to its president.",
      "\u201cHumanitarian services and lifesaving assistance in Sudan, the world\u2019s world humanitarian crisis on record, have been shut down. The programs affected include services for children with acute malnutrition, putting them at risk,\u201d said IRC President and CEO David Miliband said in a statement shared with NBC News.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator-designate at USAID, \u201chave determined your award is not aligned with Agency priorities and made a determination that continuing this program is not in the national interest,\u201d according to a copy of a termination notice obtained by NBC News that was sent to companies with USAID contracts Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere seems to be no pattern to it\u201d other than shutting down U.S. foreign aid, one humanitarian official said.",
      "USAID provided assistance to around 130 countries in fiscal year 2023. The top 10 recipients of aid in that year were Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria.",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations International Organization for Migration told NBC News that the cuts directly affect the organization\u2019s \u201cability to support some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is fighting two lawsuits challenging the dissolution of USAID and the subsequent freeze on foreign aid. One of those suits has reached the Supreme Court, with the court on Wednesday temporarily pausing a lower court order that required the administration to release frozen foreign aid funding by midnight Wednesday.",
      "There will likely be more lawsuits against the administration as a result of the termination notices, with organizations on the hook for work that\u2019s already been done, and potentially costs to wind down these programs, while the USAID payment system remains shut down.",
      "DAI, a USAID-funded international development organization that says it works in 160 countries, received termination notices for more than 90% of its contracts.",
      "As a result, the group has been forced to furlough 500 employees, according to spokesman Steven O\u2019Connor. Not only that, the government still owes DAI for work already delivered, he said.",
      "\u201cWe prefinance all that work, then we invoice the government for reimbursement; without that reimbursement, we can\u2019t pay our staff, our partners, our vendors, our creditors,\u201d he said.",
      "In the meantime, the effects are already being felt in communities that rely on that assistance for emergency relief, with trust potentially eroding between those communities and USAID and its partner organizations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard to drive this truck in reverse, because they\u2019ve washed out the road behind us,\u201d a humanitarian official said."

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 The owners of an island volcano in New Zealand where 22 tourists and local guides died in an eruption had their criminal conviction for failing to keep visitors safe thrown out by a judge on Friday.",
      "The ruling absolves the company from paying millions of dollars in restitution to the families of those killed in the 2019 explosion on Whakaari, also known as White Island, and two dozen seriously injured survivors. Most of the 47 people on the island were U.S. and Australian cruise ship passengers on a walking tour, along with their local guides.",
      "The company, Whakaari Management \u2014 run by three brothers who own the active volcano on New Zealand\u2019s North Island \u2014 appealed their convictions for breaching New Zealand\u2019s workplace health and safety law in a three-day hearing last October at the High Court in Auckland. They were found guilty in a 2023 trial.",
      "The case hinged on whether the company \u2014 which granted access to the volcano to tourism operators and scientific groups, for a fee \u2014 should have been in charge of safety practices on the island under New Zealand\u2019s workplace health and safety laws. Anyone in charge of a workplace must ensure the management of hazards and the safety of all there, including at entry and exit points.",
      "Survivors told the trial in emotional testimony during the company\u2019s 2023 trial that they had not been told the active volcano was dangerous when they paid to visit it. They were not supplied with protective equipment, and many were wearing clothing that made their horrific burns more damaging.",
      "In Friday\u2019s written ruling, Justice Simon Moore ruled the company did not have a duty under the relevant law to ensure that the walking tour workplace was without risks to health and safety. He agreed with the company\u2019s lawyers that the firm only granted access to the bare land through permits \u2014 and should not have been legally considered an entity that managed or controlled the workplace.",
      "The judge ruled it wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the company to rely on tourism operators \u2014 who were licensed under New Zealand law \u2014 and emergency management and scientific agencies to assess the risks of activities on the island and manage safety precautions.",
      "The case had far-reaching implications and changed the laws governing New Zealand\u2019s adventure tourism industry, which is often based on outdoor thrills on or around the country\u2019s many natural hazards. Operators must now take all reasonable steps to inform customers of any serious risks.",
      "The lawyers for the company said during last October\u2019s hearing that if the conviction were allowed to stand, it would make other landowners reluctant to allow such activities to take place on their property for fear of being held responsible for the day-to-day decisions of tourism businesses operating on it \u2014 a suggestion rejected by New Zealand\u2019s workplace safety regulator, which brought the charges.",
      "Justice Moore said in Friday\u2019s ruling that a too narrow or broad interpretation of the law governing who controls a workplace could have \u201cprofound\u201d consequences.",
      "White Island, the tip of an undersea volcano also known by its M\u0101ori name Whakaari, was a popular tourist destination before the eruption and was reached by boat or helicopter from the North Island\u2019s Bay of Plenty. When the superheated steam blew in December 2019, it killed some instantly and left others with agonizing burns.",
      "The workplace safety regulator brought charges against several parties \u2014 including the company run by Andrew, Peter and James Buttle.",
      "Six entities pleaded guilty in 2022 and 2023 to the charges they faced, including five tour companies and New Zealand\u2019s geoscience research institute, which monitors active volcanoes.",
      "Charges were dismissed against the Buttle brothers individually, along with two tourism logistics firms and the government emergency management agency.",
      "In March, those convicted were ordered to pay a combined total of just over 10 million New Zealand dollars ($5.6 million) in restitution to the bereaved families and survivors. Almost half of that was due to be paid by Whakaari Management Limited.",
      "In his ruling, Justice Moore said he had not overlooked or minimized the \u201cunquantifiable tragedy\u201d of the episode.",
      "\u201cThe 47 people who were on Whakaari at the time it erupted should never have been there,\u201d he wrote. The fact that they were revealed \u201cmultiple systemic failures.\u201d",
      "The case, however, was decided on the particular law and facts and boiled down to relatively narrow legal questions, he added."
