    "story": [
      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "A classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master's degree at Columbia's graduate school of journalism.",
      "Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.",
      "By 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.",
      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.\"",

      "It has been one year since authorities announced that five people had been indicted for their alleged roles in the overdose deaths of \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry",
      "LOS ANGELES -- One year ago, federal authorities announced that five people had been charged in connection with the ketamine overdose death of Matthew Perry.",
      "All five have now agreed to plead guilty, including the personal assistant of the \u201cFriends\u201d star, an old acquaintance and two doctors.",
      "On Monday, Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors say was a dealer known as the \u201cKetamine Queen,\u201d became the fifth and final defendant to reach a deal and avoid trial.",
      "Here is a look at each of the defendants.",
      "Sangha admitted in her plea agreement that she sold Perry the lethal dose of ketamine in the days before his death on Oct. 23, 2023.",
      "A 42-year-old who was born in Britain, raised in the United States and has dual citizenship, Sangha's social media accounts before her indictment last year showed a jet-setting lifestyle, with photos of herself in posh spaces alongside rich-and-famous faces in Spain, Japan and Dubai along with her dual homes of London and Los Angeles.",
      "Prosecutors say that lifestyle was funded by a drug business she ran for at least five years from her apartment in LA's San Fernando Valley.",
      "They say she presented herself as \u201ca celebrity drug dealer with high quality goods\" and missed no opportunity to promote the idea that she was known to customers and others as the \u201cKetamine Queen.\u201d Her lawyers have derided the title as a \u201cmedia-friendly\u201d moniker.",
      "Sangha went to high school in Calabasas, California \u2014 perhaps best known as home to the Kardashians \u2014 and went to college at the University of California, Irvine, graduating in 2005 and going on to work at Merrill Lynch. She later got an MBA from the Hult International Business School in London.",
      "She was connected to Perry through his acquaintance and her co-defendant, Erik Fleming.",
      "In a raid of her apartment in March 2024, authorities said they found large amounts of cocaine, methamphetamine and ketamine. She was arrested and released on bond.",
      "In August 2024, she was indicted again with charges that tied her to Perry\u2019s death, and has been held without bail ever since.",
      "CHARGES: Three counts of distribution of ketamine, one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury and one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises.",
      "SENTENCING: A judge will set her sentencing in the coming months after she appears in court to officially change her plea. She could get up to 45 years in prison.",
      "WHAT THEY SAID: Sangha\u2019s lawyer Mark Geragos says \u201dShe\u2019s taking responsibility for her actions.\u201d",
      "Iwamasa, Perry\u2019s live-in personal assistant, was intimately involved in the actor\u2019s illegal ketamine use, acting as his drug messenger and personally giving injections, according to his plea agreement. It was the 60-year-old Iwamasa who found Perry dead in the hot tub of his Pacific Palisades home on a day when he\u2019d given him several injections.",
      "He would become the first to reach a deal with prosecutors as they sought to use him as an essential witness against other defendants.",
      "Iwamasa said he worked with co-defendants to get ketamine on Perry\u2019s behalf, including Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who taught him how to give Perry the injections.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "Mayor Shelley Berkley said tourism from Canada \u2014 Nevada's largest international market \u2014 has dried up from a torrent \u201cto a drip.\u201d Same with Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of very high rollers that come in from Mexico that aren\u2019t so keen on coming in right now. And that seems to be the prevailing attitude internationally,\u201d Berkley told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cIf you if you tell the rest of the world they\u2019re not welcome, then they won\u2019t come,\u201d Pappageorge said.",
      "Canadian airline data shows fewer passengers from north of the border are arriving at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are a big thing too. They seem to be contributing to the rising cost of everything,\u201d Hart said.",
      "At downtown's Circa Resort and Casino, international visits have dipped, especially from Canada and Japan, according to owner and CEO Derek Stevens. But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",
      "\u201cThere have been many stories written about how the \u2018end is near\u2019 in Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vegas continues to reinvent itself as a destination worth visiting.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- You know the band Devo, right? The guys with the funny red plastic hats and jumpsuits? The New Wave musicians behind the silly \u201cWhip It\u201d video? They had that odd, spiky '80s vibe? Well, it turns out you may not know as much as you think.",
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d is an eye-opening examination of an Ohio-born art-rock band that argues they were perhaps the most misunderstood band on the face of the planet. It debuts on the streaming service Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe were trivialized and pigeonholed,\u201d co-founder Gerald Casale tells The Associated Press. \u201cThis documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.\u201d",
      "Directed by Chris Smith, \u201cDevo\u201d uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young.",
      "Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d which earned them a crucial slot on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d",
      "They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, \u201cQ: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,\u201d in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Choice,\u201d which featured \u201cWhip It,\u201d a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them.",
      "But behind the odd neck braces and knee pads were powerful art and literary ideas about where the country was going. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of \u201cdevolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201d Casale says in the movie. \u201cWhat we saw was regression.\u201d",
      "The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard.",
      "That tragedy forged in the pair an antiestablishment, anti-capitalist protest, mixing lofty art history with pop culture. They admired Dadaism and Andy Warhol. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks \u2014 portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie \u201cMetropolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had a meta-approach,\u201d Casale tells the AP. \u201cIt was a multimedia, big idea approach. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.\u201d",
      "Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The upbeat \u201cBeautiful World\u201d featured footage of police violence, the KKK and bombings, while \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d warned against the dangers of conformity.",

      "Members of Devo \u2014 which also included Mark's brother, Bob, Gerald's brother, Bob, and Alan Myers \u2014 performed on TV and chatted with talk show hosts like David Letterman but their satire never seemed never to break through.",

      "LONDON -- Terence Stamp, the British actor who often played the role of a complex villain, including that of General Zod in the early Superman films, has died. He was 87.",
      "His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA.",
      "The London-born Stamp started his film career with 1962\u2019s seafaring \u201cBilly Budd,\u201d for which he earned Oscar and BAFTA award nominations.",
      "His six decades in the business were peppered with highlights, including his touching portrayal of the transsexual Bernadette in 1994's \u201cThe Adventure of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,\" the second of his two BAFTA nominations.",
      "But it will be his portrayal of the bearded Zod in 1978's \u201cSuperman\u201d and its sequel \u201cSuperman II\u201d two years later that most people associate with Stamp. As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",
      "Edgar Wright, who directed Stamp in his final feature film, 2021\u2019s \u201cLast Night in Soho,\u201d remembered the actor in an Instagram post as \u201ckind, funny, and endlessly fascinating.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back,\u201d Wright said.",
      "Bill Duke, who starred with Stamp in director Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 1999 crime drama \u201cThe Limey,\u201d said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to hear of his death.",
      "\u201cHe brought a rare intensity to the screen, but off-screen he carried himself with warmth, grace, and generosity,\u201d he said on Facebook.",
      "Stamp started his acting career on stage in the late 1950s, where he acted in repertory theatre and met Michael Caine, who was five years older than himself. The pair lived together in a flat in central London while looking for their big break.",
      "He got his break with \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",

      "Hernandez Govan, 45, was indicted on first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder charges about a year after Young Dolph was killed. Prosecutors have accused him of organizing the fatal shooting.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Govan is charged with conspiring with Justin Johnson and Cornelius Smith Jr. to kill Young Dolph.",
      "Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder in September 2024 and the same day, sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for his two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cNo. 2 person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Smith testified he received $800 before he was arrested and his defense attorney later received another $50,000.",
      "In addition to Smith\u2019s testimony, prosecutors presented a large amount of circumstantial evidence, including from surveillance cameras and Johnson\u2019s cellphone. The evidence includes calls between Smith and Johnson shortly before the killing and a call between Johnson and Big Jook immediately after.",

It\u2019s a carnival of very memorable, very Coen-esque misfits, like a grumpy bartender played by Don Swayze and Charlie Day\u2019s clueless police officer Marty Metakawitch. Marty is not the only man in town who has trouble accepting that Honey will never be interested in him. You could play a drinking game with how many times she has to tell hapless men, \u201cI like girls.\u201d",
      "Not only is queer literacy low in this Bakersfield, but many in town seem to have come under the influence of a church leader played by Chris Evans, the Rev. Drew Devlin, whose high-wattage smile and proclivity for flirting have made him a local celebrity. Evans, who seems to be having fun in a weirder role, plays the Rev. Drew as a charismatic creep, an ego-driven and possibly sex-addicted influencer who is also peddling drugs and arranging hits around town. He too has a boss, or bosses, known only as \u201cthe French,\u201d which is amusingly underexplained.

      "Not unlike the new \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d this saga begins with a suspicious vehicular death. The deceased was an almost-client of Honey\u2019s, which sets her off poking around and looking for answers. Most of her cases are of the cheating spouse type, and this is just more interesting. Meanwhile, others start dropping dead too. Some of these deaths feel spiritually, comedically similar to the Mark Pellegrino sequence in \u201cMullholland Drive\u201d (not the only Lynchian nod). And all signs are pointing back to the church, though Honey gets a bit distracted with a new fling in Aubrey Plaza\u2019s lustful cop MG Falcone and some family drama with her wayward niece Corinne (Talia Ryder).",
      "\u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d might play more like a pilot episode of a television series than a contained film, but it is a step up from Coen and Cooke's previous effort, \u201cDrive Away Dolls,\u201d which felt constructed of comedic parts whose shelf life expired 20 years ago. This script, written by Coen and Cooke, is probably just as vintage, technically speaking, but it feels more timeless. With a stable of memorable side characters, including Josh Pafchek as the reverend's assistant and Jacnier as a skittish new drug dealer named Hector, \u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d is gory, unapologetically sexual, quippy and dark. It also clocks in at under 90 minutes \u2014 they knew just when to get out.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- For a 3 1/2-year-old, Elmo sure has sung a lot on \"Sesame Street\" with some of the best musicians in the world.",
      "But it wasn't until Thursday that the friendly red monster made his Grand Ole Opry debut, a country music rite of passage. The squeaky voiced singer's roots in the genre actually run pretty deep.",
      "Elmo helped ring in the Grand Ole Opry's 100th anniversary this year by co-hosting with his \u201cSesame Street\u201d pal Abby Cadabby. Elmo, in a little blue cowboy hat and matching shirt, teamed up for a duet alongside Lauren Alaina, while Abby Cadabby sang with Tayla Lynn, the daughter of Loretta Lynn, the late country star who had visited \"Sesame Street\" herself.",
      "\u201cWe sing all the time on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 but um, well, being able to sing in the home of country music is amazing!\u201d Abby Cadabby told The Associated Press prior to their performance.",
      "The puppet pair shared the spotlight in Music City during a stop on the \"Sesame Street\" crew's Road Trip Across America this summer and fall, when the characters that kids have watched on TV for decades are heading to events such as professional baseball games, state fairs and corn mazes. Cookie Monster even served as the grand marshal at the NASCAR Brickyard 400 in Indiana, making a cookie crumb mess, as expected.",
      "Throughout the years, the \"Sesame Street\" gang has played and sung songs with some of country music's brightest stars, including Garth Brooks, Lee Ann Womack, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, Thomas Rhett, Kane Brown, Mickey Guyton, Kacey Musgraves and more. Chris Stapleton stopped by Sesame Street in late July.",
      "Johnny Cash made multiple appearances. He won over Oscar the Grouch with his song, \u201cNasty Dan,\u201d about a mean guy who never laughed and was rumored to have never taken a bath. \u201cWow, I'd like him,\u201d Oscar the Grouch mused from his trash can.",
      "Loretta Lynn, meanwhile, joined for a math lesson with the Count on the song, \u201cCount on Me.\u201d",
      "In their interview with AP, Elmo and Abby Cadabby said the Count always talks about Loretta Lynn. Elmo said Stapleton's song about the power of music was really great.",
      "\u201cElmo got to wear his hat,\u201d Elmo said of Stapleton. \"It was a little big for Elmo, but that's OK. A really good time.\"",
      "Both of them were also dreaming big about singing with Dolly Parton.",

      "After getting out of the scripted TV business in 2021 for reality TV and sports coverage, USA Network is returning to air scripted originals with the legal drama \u201cThe Rainmaker.\"",
      "Since 2021, the USA Network had stacked its lineup with reality shows and sports, entirely forgoing original, scripted programming. Fans of \"Suits\u201d, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d and \u201cMonk\u201d were left with only memories of those shows' case-of-the-week storytelling. But on Friday, the network returns to scripted TV with the legal thriller \u201cThe Rainmaker.\u201d",
      "If the title sounds familiar, it's because it\u2019s based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham, which was first adapted into the 1997 Matt Damon-starring film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In this \u201cRainmaker,\u201d British actor Milo Callaghan plays Rudy Baylor. It's the first leading role for Callaghan, who had previously played recurring characters in shows like HBO's \u201cDune: Prophecy\" and Starz\u2019s \u201cThe Spanish Princess.\u201d",
      "Baylor is fresh out of law school and about to start working at the largest law firm in the state, run by Leo F. Drummond (John Slattery). On his first day, Baylor gets fired after challenging Drummond in a meeting. Desperate for work, he takes a job at a small ambulance-chasing firm that works out of a former taco joint. His boss is Jocelyn \u201cBruiser\u201d Stone (Lana Parrilla, in a gender swap from the film where Mickey Rourke had the role). She\u2019s smart, confident and not afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Rudy\u2019s first big case pits him against the big, fancy law firm that let him go \u2014 and his girlfriend who still works there.",
      "Callaghan told The Associated Press about learning legalese while doing a Memphis accent and familiarizing himself with the source material. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I watched it when I got cast. Matt Damon is somebody that every young actor would look up to. I wanted to be aware of the work that he did. I mean, it was a Coppola movie as well, so I was excited to see it. And then I gave it maybe like 20 minutes' thought and focused on the script because it is different and I think we have 10 hours of television to explore this character. We go on a windier road than the movie.",
      "CALLAGHAN: Yes. It\u2019s a slow-paced thriller, really, but fantastic. And there\u2019s this chunk, it must be about 100 pages, of him just preparing for this case for months and months and months. So I never wanted it to feel like it was off-the-hand genius. It felt like this is a situation that has to be honored to a certain extent. Like, you can be a fantastic lawyer, but you don\u2019t get there without grinding and grafting. We had great scenes where we were working late into the night.",

      "CALLAGHAN: Consistent work with a great dialogue coach. I remember I got there on my first day and I was running lines with P.J.

For a movie, you might get away with it, but for 10 hours of television, it just has to be light, it has to be quick, it has to be at your fingertips.",
      "CALLAGHAN: \u201cNorth City Hospital.\u201d It was the hardest thing. I was like, 'Why did you call it this?\" I got all this legalese down and then \u201cNorth City Hospital\u201d would shoot me in the foot every time.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I went through major trials, like the whole O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Gwyneth Paltrow trial. And also obscure trials. I studied attorneys and their patterns of speech and the way they address the court. We don't really have the same kind of pop star element to the legal system of like, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who represented this person and that person.\u201d Studying that is fascinating.",

      "Born in Melbourne, Australia, Rogers' first foray into performing was in his early twenties and playing drums in a rock band with a group of friends. They weren't successful so Rogers turned to commercial work and modeling to earn some money. When the band dissolved, Rogers decided to give acting a try. After various roles in Australia, he also worked as a DJ and eventually moved to Los Angeles to try to break into Hollywood. He said casting directors were initially turned off by his accent but he eventually landed a two-day role on \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d in 1980.",
      "\u201cI had no idea at the point how big the show was,\u201d Rogers told fellow \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d actor Maurice Benard on the YouTube show, \u201cState of Mind with Maurice Benard\u201d in 2022.",
      "\u201cI had no name. I was brought in expressly to beat up the hero, Luke, (played by Anthony Geary), and then disappear,\u201d Rogers said. His first day was half-over when then-executive producer Gloria Monty asked if he would like to stay on. They had no character written for him so for three weeks Monty asked him to just appear in scenes \u201clooking furtive, looking suspicious\u201d until they came up with a storyline. It was decided he would play a spy known as \u201cCK8\u201d and eventually he was given the name Robert Scorpio. The character would remain a fixture in Port Charles for the rest of Rogers' life, even when he wasn't a current cast member.",
      "Scorpio's on again/off again romance with Emma Samms' character, Holly Sutton, remained a favorite among fans. Scorpio also had a romance, and many storylines with another spy, Anna Devane, played by Finola Hughes. Scorpio and Devane shared a daughter, Robin, played by Kimberly McCullough. Samms returned to the show for a stint last fall where it was revealed that Scorpio was the father of her adult daughter, Sasha Gilmore (played by Sofia Mattson.)",

      "Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film \u201cEast of Wall.\u201d",
      "The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. The film won an audience award earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "At the heart of \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. In the film, the horses she rescues and rehabilitates are sold at auctions and often accepted for far less than what they\u2019re worth. She needs the money. There are bills to pay on the ranch and many mouths to feed (not just her own kids, but others from around the town who come to her for safety and shelter when their own caretakers stop providing).",
      "Tabatha is also living with new and old traumas, from the generational agony of abuse to the more recent death of her husband, the shocking circumstances of which are withheld for some time. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. Teenage Porshia provides the poetic voiceovers, in which she talks about riding, her mother and, most effectively, the land. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz\u2019s narration in \u201cDays of Heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cEast of Wall\u201d is best when it\u2019s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. Some have suggested that \u201cEast of Wall\u201d might have been stronger as a documentary. These women are vibrant and authentic and don't look like anyone we see in the movies these days, with real bodies and imperfect skin, heads half-shaved, tattoos everywhere and the ability to really, really ride \u2014 no stunt team required. And they have stories to tell, many of them unhappy, as we see in one of the most moving non-action scenes involving a group of mothers speaking candidly about their lives and their regrets.",
      "The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy\u2019s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama\u2019s sake. He offers to buy the ranch and let them live and work as usual, just for him now instead of themselves. These are the kind of scenes that remind you that the filmmakers, despite all their best intentions and care, are, in essence, also interlopers in this world.",

      "The group\u2019s new COVID-19 recommendations \u2014 released Tuesday \u2014 come amid a tumultuous year for public health, as vaccine skeptics have come into power in the new Trump administration and government guidance has become increasingly confusing.",

      "The AAP is strongly recommending COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years. Shots also are advised for older children if parents want their kids vaccinated, the AAP said.",
      "That differs from guidance established under U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which doesn't recommend the shots for healthy children of any age but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.",
      "Children ages 6 months to 2 years are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and it was important that recommendations continue to emphasize the need for them to get vaccinated, said Campbell, a University of Maryland infectious diseases expert.",
      "Vaccinations also are recommended for older children who have chronic lung diseases or other conditions that put them at higher risk for severe disease, the AAP said.",
      "The 95-year-old Itasca, Illinois-based organization has issued vaccination recommendations for children since the 1930s. In 1995, it synced its advice with recommendations made by the federal government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "There have been a few small differences between AAP and CDC recommendations since then. For example, the AAP has advised that children get HPV vaccinations starting at age 9; the CDC says that's OK but has emphasized vaccinations at ages 11 and 12.",

      "Beshear's action in his state comes as a coalition of 21 attorneys general, led by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, is urging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to take emergency action banning the unregulated drug. It poses a growing public health threat and is increasingly contributing to overdose deaths, the attorneys general said in a letter dated Monday to DEA Administrator Terry Cole.",

Unlike regulated medications, illicitly manufactured bromazolam lacks quality controls, making it particularly lethal for unsuspecting users, they said.",

      "\u201cInstead of enjoying family vacations at Michigan\u2019s beautiful lakes and campgrounds, for the third summer in a row, Michiganders are forced to breathe hazardous air as a result of Canada\u2019s failure to prevent and control wildfires,\u201d read a statement last week from the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, echoing similar missives from Republicans in Iowa, New York, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.",
      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.",

      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",
      "\u201cPeople can make up their own mind as to why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something clearly has changed.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax \u2014 a belief echoed by many in the GOP \u2014 and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.",
      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action.

      "President Donald Trump's policy and tax bill, known as the \u201c big beautiful bill,\u201d blocked Medicaid money from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider.

      "Global talks to slash plastic production and the toxic chemicals used to produce plastic products fell apart in Geneva this week",
      "Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today.",
      "Though as many as 100 countries sought caps on production, powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and the United States stood against them. They argued the caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.",
      "That means any progress continues to depend on efforts to improve recycling, reuse and product design \u2014 the very things that powerful nations argued were sufficient to address the problem without resorting to production cuts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "California is currently suing oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, alleging deception about the possibilities of plastic recycling.",
      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",
      "Alternatives to plastics could also be made out of sustainable, less harmful and even regenerative materials, such as seaweed, Kaufman said. There has been progress on this front, but most solutions have not scaled up yet.",

      "Putin has balked at that prospect. With his forces inching forward in Ukraine, he has little incentive to freeze their movement.",
      "Ahead of his meeting with the Russian leader last week, Trump threatened Russia with \u201csevere consequences\u201d if it didn\u2019t accept a ceasefire. Afterward, he dropped that demand and said it was best to focus on a comprehensive peace deal \u2014 as Putin has pushed for.",
      "Trump said in Monday\u2019s Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy that a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d But after his closed-door meeting with European leaders and Zelenskyy, Trump told reporters that \u201call of us would obviously prefer the immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Where Trump ultimately falls on that issue is important because it could affect how much Ukrainian land Russia has seized by the time the two sides get around to hammering out how much it could keep.",

      "Moscow's forces also hold Crimea as well as parts of six other regions \u2014 all adding up to about one-fifth of Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy has long noted the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits breaking up his country. He has also suggested the demand for territory would serve as a springboard for future invasion.",
      "Rutte said the possibility of Ukraine ceding occupied territory to Russia in return for peace wasn\u2019t discussed in Monday\u2019s talks. That is an issue for Zelenskyy and Putin to consider together, he said to Fox News.",
      "Zelenskyy has repeatedly suggested sitting down with Putin, even challenging the Russian leader to meet him as part of direct peace talks between the two sides in Turkey in May. Putin snubbed that offer, saying that significant progress on an agreement would have to be made before the pair met in person.",
      "On Monday, Trump appeared to back Zelenskyy's plan. \u201cI called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy,\u201d Trump said in a social media post.",
      "He said he would join the two leaders afterward.",
      "But when discussing a phone call held after the meeting between Trump and the Russian leader, Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov gave no indication that either a bilateral or a trilateral meeting with Ukraine had been agreed.",
      "European leaders know that Putin doesn't want to meet Zelenskyy and that he won't allow Western troops in Ukraine \u2014 but they're expressing optimism that these things could happen in the hopes of forcing Putin to be the one to say no to Trump, according to Janis Kluge of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.",

      "The Fifth Presidential Summit of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, which officially begins in the Colombian capital on Tuesday, will bring together leaders alongside Indigenous representatives and scientists.

They said decades of deforestation, mining, fossil fuel drilling and large-scale farming have pushed the region toward a point of no return.",
      "Among their demands are legal protection of Indigenous lands, recognition of their communities as official decision-makers within the treaty body, and a ban on new oil, gas and mining projects in the rainforest. They also propose a working group on a \u201cjust transition\u201d \u2014 a shift to cleaner energy and away from coal, oil or natural gas \u2014 and an observatory to track threats against environmental defenders.",
      "The groups noted that many commitments made in the 2023 Belem Declaration \u2014 a joint pledge by Amazon nations to cooperate on protecting the rainforest \u2014 have yet to be implemented, and cautioned against another round of \u201cempty promises.\u201d They stressed that violence against activists continues to rise across the Amazon, calling for regional protection measures.",
      "The week-long program includes an \u201cAmazon Dialogues\u201d forum bringing together civil society, scientists and Indigenous leaders; a panel on the rainforest\u2019s \u201cflying rivers\u201d that help regulate South America\u2019s climate; and a \u201cRoad to COP30\u201d event meant to shape the Amazon\u2019s voice at the next U.N. climate conference in Brazil in November.",

      "The Kiruna Church \u2014 called Kiruna Kyrka in Swedish \u2014 and its belfry are being moved this week along a 5-kilometer (3-mile) route east to a new city center as part of the town\u2019s relocation. It\u2019s happening because the world\u2019s largest underground iron-ore mine is threatening to swallow the town.",
      "This week, thousands of visitors have descended upon Kiruna, Sweden's northernmost town at 200 kilometers (124 miles) above the Arctic Circle. It's home to roughly 23,000 inhabitants, including members of the Sami Indigenous people, spread over nearly 19,500 square kilometers (7,528 square feet).",
      "Lena Tj\u00e4rnberg, the church\u2019s vicar, is set to kick off the move with a blessing on Tuesday morning. The journey is scheduled to end Wednesday afternoon.",
      "In 2001, the Swedish people voted the wooden church the \u201cbest building of all time, built before 1950\u201d in a poll connected to the Ministry of Culture. Built on a hill so worshippers could overlook the rest of Kiruna, the Swedish Lutheran church was designed to emulate the Sami style as a gift from LKAB, the state-owned mining company.",
      "The Kiruna mine itself dates back to 1910 and the church was completed in 1912. Its neo-Gothic exterior is considered the town's most distinctive building and tourists regularly traveled there before it was closed a year ago to prepare for the relocation. It's set to reopen in the new location at the end of 2026.",
      "Tj\u00e4rnberg said the final service in the old spot was bittersweet.",
      "\"The last day you go down the stairs and close the church door, you know it's going to be several years before you can open it \u2014 and in a new place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don't know how it's going to feel to open the door.\u201d",
      "This week's move has turned into a two-day highly choreographed media spectacle, run by LKAB and featuring an appearance by Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf. Musical performances will include a set from KAJ, Sweden\u2019s 2025 Eurovision entry that was the bookies\u2019 favorite to win this year\u2019s contest but lost out to classically trained countertenor JJ of Austria.",
      "SVT, Sweden's national broadcaster, is capitalizing on the showcase and will livestream the move both days, billing it as \u201cThe Great Church Walk\u201d to play off its success with the spring showing of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d that has enthralled millions of viewers annually since 2019.",
      "Known for both the Midnight Sun and the Northern Lights, Kiruna and the surrounding area is a major draw year-round for visitors to Swedish Lapland. The region also features the Aurora Sky Station, the Icehotel and Kebnekaise, the Nordic country\u2019s highest mountain.",
      "British tourists Anita and Don Haymes had already trekked to Kiruna twice before this year's trip. When they heard about the church's move, they changed their itinerary to ensure they'd be here for it. They took photographs of it propped up on beams and wheels this week before the move.",

      "The move of Kiruna's town center, including the church, has been in the works since 2004. As the mine expanded deeper underground, residents began seeing cracks in buildings and roads. In order to reach a new depth of 1,365 meters (4,478 feet) \u2014 and to prevent Kiruna from being swallowed up \u2014 officials began moving buildings to a new downtown at a safe distance from the mine.",
      "As of July, 25 buildings had been lifted up onto beams and wheeled east. Sixteen, including the church, remain.",
      "At approximately 40 meters (131 feet) wide with a weight of 672 metric tons (741 tons), the church required extra effort. Engineers widened a major road from 9 meters to 24 meters (30 to 79 feet) and dismantled a viaduct to make way for a new intersection.",

      "The melting has accelerated in recent years, with the glacier losing 431 meters (471 yards) in the last 10 years, nearly half of that since 2021, the service said. It's another example of how accelerating global warming is melting and shrinking Europe\u2019s glaciers, causing a host of environmental and other impacts.",

      "But the hot summers are \u201cno longer able to guarantee the survival of the winter snowpack,\u201d that keeps the glacier intact, Toffaletti said.",
      "\u201cIn order to regenerate and remain in balance, a certain amount of residual snow from the winter must remain on the glacier's surface at the end of the summer. And this is happening less and less frequently,\u201d said Toffaletti.",

      "RENK, South Sudan -- As a young man in the mid-1980s, Daud Mahmoud Abdullah left his home in Aweil in South Sudan and headed north. It was a time of war. South Sudan was still part of Sudan and was fighting for independence, in a conflict that would claim about 2 million lives.",
      "He never went back. But now at 60 and after six months in a Sudanese prison, he is closer to home than he\u2019s been in 40 years. This July, he finally crossed the border back into his native South Sudan, taking a deep breath and reminding himself, \u201cI am alive.\u201d",
      "After everything that has happened to him, it feels like a miracle.",
      "Sudan \u2014 once his place of refuge \u2014 has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since April 2023 that has killed 40,000 people and displaced nearly 13 million more, according to U.N. agencies.",
      "Abdullah lived in Wad Madani, the capital of Al Jazirah state, about 135 kilometers (85 miles) south of Khartoum. There had been incursions into the area by the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary force once known as the Janjaweed who were notorious for mass killings, rapes and other atrocities in Darfur two decades ago. More recently, the RSF have again been accused of by the International Criminal Court of committing war crimes, including the attacks on famine-hit Zamzam and other camps in North Darfur.",
      "In January, the Sudanese armed forces began recapturing parts of Al Jazirah state from the RSF and making sweeping arrests. Abdullah got caught up in the incursions on his way home from the market: He was picked up by SAF soldiers and accused of cooperating with the RSF.",
      "Abdullah says that he was \u201cbeaten, tortured and burned with cigarettes\u201d to make him confess. Although he never made a confession, he was thrown in prison.",
      "In a report released in March, the top U.N. human rights body detailed how both the SAF and the RSF have detained tens of thousands of people \u201cwithout charge, with limited or no contact with their families, in squalid and overcrowded facilities\u201d in \u201ca widespread pattern of arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment.\u201d",
      "Abdullah can attest to this. He remembers inmates dying from starvation, beatings or illnesses like cholera daily. One morning, he discovered 28 of his fellow inmates had died in the night. For the next three days the bodies lay inside his cell, and the soldiers refused to remove them. \u201cEven when you shouted to them, they would tell you, \u2018If you want to die also, you can die with them,\" Abdullah said.",
      "The Associated Press spoke to eight men in total, some of whom were detained in other prisons in Al Jazirah state and Khartoum. All recounted nightmarish conditions during their incarceration. They described being crammed into cells alongside hundreds of other prisoners. Cells were so crowded that they were forced to sleep with their knees tucked under their chin. Beatings occurred regularly; one said he lost the use of his right eye as a result.",
      "Michael Deng Dut, 29, said he had been \u201ctortured with electricity more than 18 times.\u201d Simon Tong, 39, said that he was tortured with a knife during an interrogation, and rolled up his sleeve to expose the scars on his arm.",
      "Many of the men said they were given only a handful of food and a small cup of water once a day. \u201cThis is the reason many of us passed away, because of the lack of food and water,\" Tong said.",
      "In July, 99 South Sudanese prisoners were separated from the other inmates. As the men awaited their fate, one died, reducing their number to 98. On July 28, they were bundled into a bus and driven away, not knowing where they were going.",

      "The border town of Renk has become a hub for South Sudanese nationals trying to get home. When the Sudanese civil war broke out in 2023, UN agencies and the South Sudanese government established an onward transportation program which has moved more than 250,000 people, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Office of Migration.",
      "On June 1, the program was suspended due to global cuts to humanitarian funding. The number of people living in and around a transit center in Renk has since swelled to 12,000, roughly six times its intended capacity. Thousands are living in makeshift shelters made of sticks and cloth.",
      "But for Abdullah, arriving in Renk was a moment of overwhelming joy after months of torture and uncertainty. He was overcome to see his wife, daughter, and younger brother waiting for him. His wife had decided to take his family south after his younger brother had been arrested and released by SAF for the third time.",

      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with China\u2019s top diplomat on Tuesday in a sign of easing tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors after a yearslong standoff between the Asian powers.",
      "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who arrived in India on Monday, is scheduled to hold talks with Modi and other leaders, including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, about the disputed border in the Himalayan mountains. Reducing the number of troops on the border, and resuming some trade there, is expected to be on the agenda.",
      "The rebuilding of ties coincides with friction between New Delhi and Washington after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on India, a longtime ally seen as a counterbalance against China's influence in Asia. India is part of the Quad security alliance with the U.S. along with Australia and Japan.",
      "India and China's decades-old border dispute worsened in 2020 after a deadly clash between their troops in the Ladakh region. The chill in relations affected trade, diplomacy and air travel as both sides deployed tens of thousands of security forces in border areas.",
      "Some progress has been made since then.",
      "Last year, India and China agreed to a pact on border patrols and withdrew additional forces along some border areas. Both countries continue to fortify their border by building roads and rail networks.",
      "In recent months, the countries have increased official visits and discussed easing some trade restrictions, movement of citizens and visas for businesspeople. In June, Beijing allowed pilgrims from India to visit holy sites in Tibet. Both sides are working to restore direct flights.",
      "Last week, the spokesman for India\u2019s foreign ministry, Randhir Jaiswal, said India and China were in discussions to restart trade through three points along their 3,488-kilometer (2,167-mile) border.",
      "Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank, said relations are still at an uneasy level of normalization.",
      "\u201cSettling the boundary issue between the two countries requires political compromise at the highest political level,\u201d said Joshi, who also served as a member of the advisory board for India\u2019s National Security Council. He asserted that the countries are \"still talking past each other when it comes to the border dispute and issues surrounding it.\"",
      "On Monday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Beijing is willing to take Wang\u2019s India visit as an opportunity to work with the Indian side to \u201cproperly handle differences and promote the sustained, sound and stable development of China-India relations.\u201d",
      "Mao said Wang\u2019s meeting with Modi's national security adviser will \u201ccontinue in-depth communication to jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas.\u201d",
      "The thaw between Beijing and New Delhi began last October when Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at a summit of emerging economies in Russia. It was the first time the leaders had spoken in person since 2019.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea, which has warned the drills would deepen regional tensions and vowed to respond to \u201cany provocation\u201d against its territory.",
      "The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, the second of two large-scale exercises held annually in South Korea, after another set in March, will involve 21,000 soldiers, including 18,000 South Koreans, in computer-simulated command post operations and field training.",
      "The drills, which the allies describe as defensive, could trigger a response from North Korea, which has long portrayed the allies\u2019 exercises as invasion rehearsals and has often used them as a pretext for military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.",
      "In a statement last week, North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol said the drills show the allies\u2019 stance of \u201cmilitary confrontation\u201d with the North and declared that its forces would be ready to counteract \u201cany provocation going beyond the boundary line.\u201d",
      "Ulchi Freedom Shield comes at a pivotal moment for South Korea\u2019s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who is preparing for an Aug. 25 summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington. Trump has raised concerns in Seoul that he may shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the American troop presence in South Korea and possibly reducing it as Washington shifts its focus more toward China.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high as North Korea has brushed aside Lee\u2019s calls to resume diplomacy with its war-divided rival, with relations having soured in recent years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerated his weapons program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat's needed now is the courage to steadily take steps toward easing tensions, grounded in a firmly maintained state of ironclad security readiness,\u201d Lee said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday.

      "Seoul\u2019s previous conservative government responded to North Korean threats by expanding military exercises with the United States and seeking stronger U.S. assurances for nuclear deterrence, drawing an angry reaction from Kim, who last year renounced long-term reconciliation goals and rewrote the North\u2019s constitution to label the South a permanent enemy.",
      "In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South\u2019s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.",

The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.",
      "When asked whether the Lee government\u2019s steps to restore the agreement would affect the allies\u2019 drills, the South\u2019s Defense Ministry said Monday that there are no immediate plans to suspend live-fire training near the Koreas\u2019 disputed western maritime border.",
      "While the allies have postponed half of Ulchi Freedom Shield\u2019s originally planned 44 field training programs to September, U.S. military officials denied South Korean media speculation that the scaled-back drills were meant to make room for diplomacy with the North, citing heat concerns and flood damage to some training fields.",

      "ISLAMABAD -- Cloudbursts are causing chaos in mountainous parts of India and Pakistan, with tremendous amounts of rain falling in a short period of time over a concentrated area. The intense, sudden deluges have proved fatal in both countries.",
      "As many as 300 people died in one northwestern Pakistani district, Buner, after a cloudburst. The strength and volume of rain triggered flash flooding, landslides and mudflows. Boulders from steep slopes came crashing down with the water to flatten homes and reduce villages to rubble.",
      "The northern Indian state of Uttarakhand had a cloudburst earlier this month. Local TV showed floodwaters surging down a mountain and crashing into Dharali, a Himalayan village. In 2013, more than 6,000 people died and 4,500 villages were affected when a similar cloudburst struck the state.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about cloudbursts:",
      "A cloudburst occurs when a large volume of rain falls in a very short period, usually more than 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) within an hour over a localized area, around 30 square kilometers (11.6 square miles).",
      "Cloudbursts are sudden and violent, with devastating consequences and widespread destruction, and can be the equivalent of several hours of normal rainfall or longer. The event is the bursting of a cloud and the discharge of its contents at the same time, like a rain bomb.",
      "Several factors contribute to a cloudburst, including warm, moist air rising upward, high humidity, low pressure, instability and convective cloud formation.",
      "Moist air is forced to rise after encountering a hill or mountain. This rising air cools and condenses. Clouds that are large, dense and capable of heavy rainfall form.",
      "Hills or mountains act like barriers and often trap these clouds, so they cannot disperse or move easily. Strong upward currents keep moisture suspended inside the clouds, delaying rainfall.",
      "When the clouds cannot hold the accumulated moisture anymore, they burst and release it all at once.",
      "Cloudbursts thrive in moisture, monsoons and mountains. Regions of India and Pakistan have all three, making them vulnerable to these extreme weather events.",
      "The Himalayas, Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountain ranges are home to the world\u2019s highest and most famous peaks, spanning multiple countries including India and Pakistan.",
      "The frequency of cloudbursts in these two South Asian nations has been steadily rising due to a warming atmosphere, because a warmer air mass can hold more moisture, creating conditions for sudden and intense downpours.",
      "The South Asian region has traditionally had two monsoon seasons. One typically lasts from June to September, with rains moving southwest to northeast. The other, from roughly October to December, moves in the opposite direction.",
      "But with more planet-warming gases in the air, the rain now only loosely follows this pattern.",
      "This is because the warmer air can hold more moisture from the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, and that rain then tends to get dumped all at once. It means the monsoon is punctuated with intense flooding and dry spells, rather than sustained rain throughout.",

      "It recommends afforestation to reduce surface runoff and enhance water absorption, and regular clearing and widening of riverbanks and drainage channels.",
      "Experts say cloudbursts have increased in recent years, partly due to climate change, while damage from associated storms has also increased due to unplanned development in mountain areas.",
      "Climate change has directly amplified the triggers of cloudbursts in Pakistan, especially. Every 1\u00b0C rise allows the air to hold about 7% more moisture, increasing the potential for heavy rainfall in short bursts.",
      "The warming of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea pushes more moisture into the atmosphere. Melting glaciers and snow alter local weather patterns, making rainfall events more erratic and extreme. Environmental degradation, in the form of deforestation and wetland loss, reduces the land\u2019s ability to absorb water, magnifying flash floods.",

      "It was not an isolated case, but part of a broader shift in the war where medical evacuation has become increasingly difficult.",
      "\u201cBecause of drones ... that can reach far, the danger is there for the wounded themselves and now for the crews working to get them out,\u201d said Daryna Boiko, the anesthesiologist from the \u201cUlf\u201d medical service of the 108th Da Vinci Wolves Battalion. \u201cThat\u2019s why the main difficulty now is transport.\u201d",

      "Now, the heavy use of first-person-view (FPV) drones, which let an operator see the target before striking, has turned areas up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line into kill zones. Medics say they have not treated gunshot wounds for months, and most injuries now come from FPVs.",
      "The drones are the most feared weapon, both because of their precision and because they reduce survival chances for those already injured by complicating the evacuation.",
      "For Ukraine\u2019s outnumbered army, that makes preserving crew even harder.",
      "The growing use of FPVs has also made moving the wounded between points more difficult, said the commander of the 59th Brigade medical unit with call sign Buhor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.",

      "Asked whether those conditions have increased mortality among the wounded, he replied: \u201cSignificantly. There\u2019s nothing you can do. Everything burns from those FPVs \u2014 everything, even tanks.\u201d",
      "He explained that the munitions carry a charge from a rocket-propelled grenade \u2014 a shoulder-fired weapon that launches an explosive designed to pierce armored vehicles. When it blasts, a jet of molten metal and fragments penetrate the cabin at extreme temperatures. The impact can cause anything from minor cuts and burns to severe wounds, including amputations, depending on where the fragments hit and their size.",
      "Buhor said self-aid and self-evacuation are now heavily emphasized during training, but the existence of the kill zone means soldiers can be stuck in position for days or weeks \u2014 especially if a wound is not immediately life-threatening.",
      "When Artem Fursov arrived at the stabilization post late one night with three other soldiers, Buhor inspected his wounds and praised the bandage on his arm, asking who had done it. It was the work of a fellow soldier \u2014 and an example of effective self-aid, Buhor said.",
      "Fursov, 38, was wounded on Aug. 4 by an explosive dropped from a drone, but he didn\u2019t reach a medical post until five days later. To get to safety, he had to walk several kilometers. A small wooden cross he wore under his clothes the whole time now hangs against his chest.",

Young people are faced with a choice of either taking up arms to fight in endless conflicts, or providing for their families.\u201d",
      "The war in Tigray was the reason why Nigus Yosef never finished school. When the conflict started in 2020, he was in 7th Grade, and he dropped out to join the Tigray armed forces.

      "Bolivians have headed to the polls for a pivotal election that could end the long reign of the leftist Movement Toward Socialism party",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivians headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in presidential and congressional elections that could spell the end of the Andean nation's long-dominant leftist party and see a right-wing government elected for the first time in over two decades.",
      "The election on Sunday is one of the most consequential for Bolivia in recent times \u2014 and one of the most unpredictable.",
      "Even at this late stage, a remarkable 30% or so of voters remain undecided. Polls show the two leading right-wing candidates, multimillionaire business owner Samuel Doria Medina and former President Jorge Fernando \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, locked in a virtual dead heat.",
      "But a right-wing victory isn't assured. Many longtime voters for the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, now shattered by infighting, live in rural areas and tend to be undercounted in polling.",
      "With the nation\u2019s worst economic crisis in four decades leaving Bolivians waiting for hours in fuel lines, struggling to find subsidized bread and squeezed by double-digit inflation, the opposition candidates are billing the race as a chance to alter the country\u2019s destiny.",
      "\u201cI have rarely, if ever, seen a situational tinderbox with as many sparks ready to ignite,\u201d Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, founding partner of Aurora Macro Strategies, a New York-based advisory firm, writes in a memo. Breaking the MAS party's monopoly on political power, he adds, pushes \u201cthe country into uncharted political waters amid rising polarization, severe economic fragility and a widening rural\u2013urban divide.\u201d",
      "The outcome will determine whether Bolivia \u2014 a nation of about 12 million people with the largest lithium reserves on Earth and crucial deposits of rare earth minerals \u2014 follows a growing trend in Latin America, where right-wing leaders like Argentina\u2019s libertarian Javier Milei, Ecuador\u2019s strongman Daniel Noboa and El Salvador\u2019s conservative populist Nayib Bukele have surged in popularity.",
      "A right-wing government in Bolivia could trigger a major geopolitical realignment for a country now allied with Venezuela\u2019s socialist-inspired government and world powers such as China, Russia and Iran.",
      "Doria Medina and Quiroga have praised the Trump administration and vowed to restore ties with the United States \u2014 ruptured in 2008 when charismatic, long-serving former President Evo Morales expelled the American ambassador.",
      "The right-wing front-runners also have expressed interest in doing business with Israel, which has no diplomatic relations with Bolivia, and called for foreign private companies to invest in the country and develop its rich natural resources.",
      "After storming to office in 2006 at the start of the commodities boom, Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, nationalized the nation's oil and gas industry, using the lush profits to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure and improve the lives of the rural poor.",
      "After three consecutive presidential terms, as well as a contentious bid for an unprecedented fourth in 2019 that set off popular unrest and led to his ouster, Morales has been barred from this race by Bolivia's constitutional court.",

      "\u201cThere's enthusiasm for change but no enthusiasm for the candidates,\u201d said Eddy Abasto, 44, a Tupperware vendor in Bolivia's capital of La Paz torn between voting for Doria Medina and Quiroga. \u201cIt's always the same, those in power live happily spending the country\u2019s money, and we suffer.\u201d",
      "Doria Medina and Quiroga have warned of the need for a painful fiscal adjustment, including the elimination of Bolivia\u2019s generous food and fuel subsidies, to save the nation from insolvency. Some analysts caution this risks sparking social unrest.",
      "\u201cA victory for either right-wing candidate could have grave repercussions for Bolivia\u2019s Indigenous and impoverished communities,\u201d said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a Bolivian research group. \u201cBoth candidates could bolster security forces and right-wing para-state groups, paving the way for violent crackdowns on protests expected to erupt over the foreign exploitation of lithium and drastic austerity measures.\u201d",
      "All 130 seats in Bolivia\u2019s Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, are up for grabs, along with 36 in the Senate, the upper house.",
      "If, as is widely expected, no one receives more than 50% of the vote, or 40% of the vote with a lead of 10 percentage points, the top two candidates will compete in a runoff on Oct. 19 for the first time since Bolivia's 1982 return to democracy.",

      "Nexstar Media Group is buying broadcast rival Tegna for $6.2 billion, which will help strengthen its local news offerings.",
      "The transaction, if approved, will bring together two major players in U.S. television and the country's local news landscape. Nexstar oversees more than 200 owned and partner stations in 116 markets nationwide today and also runs networks like The CW and NewsNation. Meanwhile, Tegna owns 64 news stations across 51 markets.",

      "Nexstar's purchase of Tegna also arrives amid wider regulatory shifts. Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chairman the Federal Communications Commission, which will need to give the transaction the green light, has long advocated for loosening industry restrictions. On Aug. 7, the FCC announced that it would be repealing 98 broadcast rules and requirements that it identified as \u201cobsolete, outdated, or unnecessary.\u201d",
      "Some of those rules date back nearly 50 years, the FCC said, and apply to \u201cold technology that is no longer used.\" Carr maintained that such provisions no longer serve public interest.",
      "In late July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit also vacated the FCC's \u201ctop four\u201d rule, which has long prohibited ownership of more than one of the top four stations in a single market. The ruling is still subject to a monthslong assessment by the FCC, but could significantly clear the way for future mergers in the industry.",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal appeals court has upheld a law strengthening the rights of pregnant workers, vacating a judge's earlier order that had stripped those protections from Texas state employees.",
      "The ruling was a victory for advocates of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a law that passed with bipartisan support in 2022 but quickly became embroiled in controversy over whether it covers workers seeking abortions and fertility treatments.",
      "A federal judge last year blocked enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act for Texas state employees, ruling that its passage was unconstitutional because a majority of House members were not physically present to approve the law as part of spending package in December 2022.",
      "In a 2-1 decision, the Fifth Circuit appeals court disagreed, finding that the law was properly passed under a COVID-19 pandemic-era Congressional rule allowing members to vote by proxy to meet the quorum requirement.",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act strengthens the rights of women to receive workplace accommodation for needs related to pregnancy and childbirth, such as time off for medical appointments and exemptions from heavy lifting. Its passage came after a decades long campaign by women's advocacy groups highlighting the struggles of pregnant workers, especially those in low-wage roles, who were routinely forced off the job after requesting accommodations.",
      "The Texas case differed from other lawsuits that have narrowly focused on federal regulations stating that abortion, fertility treatments and birth control are medical issues requiring protection under the new law. The lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, instead took aim at the entirety of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, drawing opposition from Republican lawmakers including former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who defended the pandemic-era proxy voting rule.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the Department of Justice has continued to fight Paxton's lawsuit, which if successful, could help open the door to legal challenges of other pandemic-era laws passed by proxy.",

      "Texas state employees are not immediately protected, however, because the appeals court ruling doesn't become final for several weeks to give time for a possible appeal, Chettiar said.",
      "Conservative officials and religious groups, meanwhile, have been largely successfully in challenging the regulations passed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which established that workers seeking abortions are entitled accommodations.",
      "In May, a federal court struck down the abortion provisions of the EEOC regulations in response to lawsuits brought by states of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "The Trump administration is almost certain to comply with that ruling. President Donald Trump in January fired two of the EEOC\u2019s democratic commissioners, paving the way for him to quickly establish a Republican majority at the agency. EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, has signaled her support for revising the regulations, arguing the agency exceeded its authority by including not only abortion but fertility treatments and birth control as medical needs covered by the law.",

      "\u201cIf it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it. If it means our union being fined, then so be it,\" Hancock said. \"We\u2019re looking for a solution here. Our members want a solution here, but solution has to be found at the bargaining table.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.",
      "In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet\u2019s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.",

      "Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.",
      "A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,\u201d Keoleian said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.\u201d",

      "Ernst has called the EV initiative a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and \"a textbook example of waste,\u201d citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.",
      "\u201cYou always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that\u2019s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,\" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.",
      "\u201cFor now,\u201d she added, \"gas-powered vehicles \u2014 use some ethanol in them \u2014 I think is wonderful.\u201d",
      "Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.",
      "Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project \"has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.\u201d",
      "The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was \u201cvery modest\" and not unexpected.",
      "\u201cThe production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,\u201d spokesperson Kim Frum said.",
      "The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan.

      "A judge has fined Qantas Airways $59 million for illegally firing over 1,800 ground staff at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic",
      "MELBOURNE -- A judge on Monday fined Qantas Airways 90 million Australian dollars ($59 million) for illegally firing more than 1,800 ground staff at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The penalty is in addition to the AU$120 million ($78 million) in compensation that Australia\u2019s biggest airline had already agreed to pay its former employees.",
      "Australian Federal Court Justice Michael Lee said the outsourcing of 1,820 baggage handler and cleaner jobs at Australian airports in late 2020 was the \u201clargest and most significant contravention\u201d of relevant Australian labor laws in their 120-year history.",
      "Qantas agreed in December last year to pay AU$120 million ($78 million) in compensation to former staff after seven High Court judges unanimously rejected the Sydney-based airline\u2019s appeal against the judgment that outsourcing their jobs was illegal.",
      "The Transport Workers Union, which took the airline to court, had argued the airline should receive the largest fine available \u2014 AU$121,212,000 ($78,969,735).",
      "Lee ruled that the minimum fine to create a deterrence should be AU$90 million ($59 million), noting that Qantas executives had expected to save AU$125 million ($81 million) a year through outsourcing the jobs.",
      "Lee questioned the sincerity of Qantas\u2019s apology for its illegal conduct, noting that the airline later unsuccessfully argued that it owed no compensation to its former staff.",
      "\u201cIf any further evidence was needed of the unrelenting and aggressive litigation strategy adopted in this case by Qantas, it is provided by this effort directed to denying any compensation whatsoever to those in respect of whom Qantas was publicly professing regret for their misfortune,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\"I do think that the people in charge of Qantas now have some genuine regret, but this more likely reflects the damage that this case has done to the company rather than remorse for the damage done to the affected workers,\u201d Lee added.",
      "Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson, who was the airline's chief financial officer during the layoffs, said in a statement after Monday's decision: \u201cWe sincerely apologize to each and every one of the 1,820 ground handling employees and to their families who suffered as a result.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe decision to outsource five years ago, particularly during such an uncertain time, caused genuine hardship for many of our former team and their families,\" she said.",
      "\u201cOver the past 18 months we\u2019ve worked hard to change the way we operate as part of our efforts to rebuild trust with our people and our customers. This remains our highest priority as we work to earn back the trust we lost,\u201d she added.",

      "Small-scale solar panels about the size of a door are poised to be plugged into more U.S. homes and apartments as homeowners and renters who want to harness the sun\u2019s energy look for cheaper alternatives to rooftop installations",
      "When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.",
      "\u201cWe thought absolutely, let\u2019s do this right away,\u201d said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.",
      "These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven\u2019t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.",
      "The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer's backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.",
      "\u201cWe like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,\u201d Dwyer said.",
      "Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.",
      "Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility\u2019s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home's circuit breaker.",
      "Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.",
      "\u201cThe interest and demand have been overwhelming,\u201d said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. \u201cIt is clear that we are hitting a nerve \u2014 many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.\u201d",
      "Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they're allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.",
      "Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn't understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.",
      "Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility's policy.",
      "During the early days of plug-in solar's growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cUtilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,\u201d Cudd said.",
      "This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that's passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.",
      "\u201cEurope has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have them here in the United States,\u201d Ward said.",

      "Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.",

      "Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company's basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.",
      "Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom\u2019s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.",

Running back Chase Brown\u2019s 1-yard touchdown on fourth-and-goal capped a 58-yard drive on the opening possession at Northwest Stadium.",
      "The Bengals (1-1) planned on using their starters longer in preseason games to hopefully avoid a string of poor regular-season starts. Over two games with Burrow at quarterback, Cincinnati scored touchdowns on four of five possessions.",

      "All too often during what has become a frustrating season for a last-place team, so is the result.",
      "When the Pirates failed to break a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the sixth, it meant that Skenes was left a no-decision for the 10th time in 26 starts. In nine of those starts, he's allowed two runs or fewer, one of the main reasons he could become the first starting pitcher with a losing record to claim the Cy Young.",
      "That prospect puts him at the forefront of the increasingly charged debate around whether \u201cpitcher wins\u201d are a valuable metric in determining a pitcher's actual worth, something that's not lost on him.",
      "Yet asked if the lack of \u201cWs\u201d under his name bothers him, he shrugs.",

      "He's still trying to figure out how to make sure he gets enough sleep given the erratic schedule. To make sure his diet doesn't slip when the club is on the road. To consistently do all the little things behind the scenes that help him be at his best every fifth day.",

      "Minnesota has joined a wave of states suing TikTok, claiming the app uses addictive algorithms that harm young people's mental health",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota on Tuesday joined a wave of states suing TikTok, alleging the social media giant preys on young people with addictive algorithms that trap them into becoming compulsive consumers of its short videos.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free speech. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna holler that,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s actually about deception, manipulation, misrepresentation. This is about a company knowing the dangers, and the dangerous effects of its product, but making and taking no steps to mitigate those harms or inform users of the risks.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in state court, alleges that TikTok is violating Minnesota laws against deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. It follows a flurry of lawsuits filed by more than a dozen states last year alleging the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health. Minnesota's case brings the total to about 24 states, Ellison's office said.",
      "Many of the earlier lawsuits stemmed from a nationwide investigation into TikTok launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 14 states into the effects of TikTok on young users\u2019 mental health. Ellison, a Democrat, said Minnesota waited while it did its own investigation.",
      "Sean Padden, a middle-school health teacher in the Roseville Area school district, joined Ellison, saying he has witnessed a correlation between increased TikTok use and an \u201cirrefutable spike in student mental health issues,\u201d including depression, anxiety, anger, lowered self-esteem and a decrease in attention spans as they seek out the quick gratification that its short videos offer.",
      "The lawsuit comes while President Donald Trump is still trying to broker a deal to bring the social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, under American ownership over concerns about the data security of its 170 million American users. While Trump campaigned on banning TikTok, he also gained more than 15 million followers on the platform since he started sharing videos on it.",
      "No matter who ultimately owns TikTok, Ellison said, it must comply with the law.",

      "TikTok disputed Minnesota's allegations.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit is based on misleading and inaccurate claims that fail to recognize the robust safety measures TikTok has voluntarily implemented to support the well-being of our community,\" company spokesperson Nathaniel Brown said in a statement. \"Teen accounts on TikTok come with 50+ features and settings designed to help young people safely express themselves, discover and learn.",
      "\"Through our Family Pairing tool, parents can view or customize 20+ content and privacy settings, including screen time, content filters, and our time away feature to pause a teen\u2019s access to our app,\u201d Brown added.",
      "Minnesota is seeking a declaration that TikTok's practices are deceptive, unfair or unconscionable under state law, a permanent injunction against those practices, and up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child has accessed TikTok. Ellison wouldn't put a total on that but said, \u201cit's a lot.\u201d He estimated that \u201chundreds of thousands of Minnesota kids\u201d have TikTok on their devices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to shut them down, but we are insisting that they clean up their act,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThere are legitimate uses of products like TikTok. But like all things, they have to be used properly and safely.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is also among dozens of U.S. states that have sued Meta Platforms for allegedly building features into Instagram and Facebook that addict people. The messaging service Snapchat and the gaming platform Roblox are also facing lawsuits by some other states alleging harm to kids.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As Russia held its Victory Day parade this year, hackers backing the Kremlin hijacked an orbiting satellite that provides television service to Ukraine.",
      "Instead of normal programing, Ukrainian viewers saw parade footage beamed in from Moscow: waves of tanks, soldiers and weaponry. The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.",
      "Disabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without a single bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite's security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.",

      "More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.",
      "That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness \u2014 or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.",
      "Hackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it's running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.",
      "As Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine's government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.",
      "National security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.",
      "U.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.",
      "Turner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.",
      "Russia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.",
      "Turner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.",
      "\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d",

      "The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people \u2014 followed closely by Hurricane Rita.",
      "Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.",
      "Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.",
      "Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.",
      "On Louisiana\u2019s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state\u2019s 2029 coastal master plan.",
      "The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been \u201cdying for over a century\u201d because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.",
      "Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.",
      "The same is happening in other states.",
      "In Bayou La Batre, Alabama \u2014 a fishing village built in the late 1700s \u2014 The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy\u2019s coastal programs director.",
      "The conservancy and others also have been creating miles of oyster reefs, and are acquiring tracts of land away from the coast to allow habitats to move as seawater encroaches.",

      "Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt.",

      "Federal officials say Arizona, Nevada and Mexico must again live with less Colorado River water as drought lingers in the West",
      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

      "Some cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been drawing attention because they have wart-like growths on their faces that look like horns",
      "DENVER -- A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \u201cFrankenstein bunnies,\u201d \u201cdemon rabbits\u201d and \u201czombie rabbits.\u201d But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",
      "Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.",

      "The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don\u2019t harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits\u2019 immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.",

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Menendez brothers are set to make their cases for parole starting Thursday, marking the closest they've been to winning freedom from prison since their convictions almost 30 years ago for murdering their parents.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time. While defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.",
      "The brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole under California law because they were under the ages of 26 when they committed their crimes.",
      "A panel or two or three parole hearing officers from a board of commissioners appointed by the governor will evaluate the brothers individually. Erik Menendez will have his hearing Thursday morning, followed by Lyle Menendez on Friday, over videoconference from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.",
      "The board will assess whether the brothers pose an \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to society\u201d if released, considering factors like criminal history, motivation for the crime and signs of remorse, behavior while in prison and plans for the future, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Even if the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers walk free \u2014 if at all.

      "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday set an Oct. 23 execution date for Anthony Boyd, 53. Boyd is one of four men convicted in the 1993 killing of Gregory Huguley in Talladega. Prosecutors said Huguley was burned to death after he failed to pay for $200 worth of cocaine.",

      "In 2018, Boyd selected nitrogen as his preferred execution method, but at the time the state had not developed procedures for using it. Lawyers for Boyd filed a federal lawsuit in July \u2014 about a month after the state began asking for his execution date \u2014 seeking to prevent the state from executing him with nitrogen. They cited descriptions of how other inmates shook on the gurney while being executed with nitrogen gas.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",

      "Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown.",

      "Canadian airline data shows fewer passengers from north of the border are arriving at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated that it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",

      "At downtown's Circa Resort and Casino, international visits have dipped, especially from Canada and Japan, according to owner and CEO Derek Stevens. But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",
      "\u201cThere have been many stories written about how the \u2018end is near\u2019 in Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vegas continues to reinvent itself as a destination worth visiting.\u201d",

      "Mother Nature is probably going to win this week. Hurricane Erin is forecast to move hundreds of miles offshore from the islands but the massive storm is still sending waves 20 feet (6 meters) or greater crashing over vulnerable sand dunes.",

      "\u201cWe haven't seen waves of that size in a while and the vulnerable spots have only gotten weaker in the past five years,\u201d said Reide Corbett, executive director of the Coastal Studies Institute, a group of several universities that study the Outer Banks.",

      "The most built up and populated part of the Outer Banks are in the north around Nags Head and Kill Devil Hills, which aren't under the evacuation order. South of the Oregon Inlet, scoured out by a 1846 hurricane, is Hatteras Island, where the only connection to the mainland is the NC 12 highway. South of there is Ocracoke Island, accessible only by boat or plane.",
      "The first highways to reach the area were built more than 60 years ago. And the Outer Banks started booming, as it went from quaint fishing villages to what it is now, dotted with 6,000-square foot vacation homes on stilts.",
      "On a nice day, what look like snowplows and street sweeper brushes wait on the side of NC 12 to scoop and sweep away the constantly blowing sand.",
      "When the storms come, water from the ocean or the sound punch through the sand dunes and wash tons of sand and debris on the road. In more extreme cases, storms can break up the pavement or even create new inlets that require temporary bridges.",
      "It cost the North Carolina Department of Transportation more than $1 million a year in regular maintenance to keep NC 12 open during the 2010s. They also spent about $50 million over the decade on repairs after storms.",

      "Scientists expect Kilauea volcano to again gush lava in the coming days for the 31st time since December as the mountain lives up to its identity as one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes",
      "HONOLULU -- Lava shoots high into the sky. Molten rock erupts from two vents simultaneously. The nighttime sky glows red and orange, reflecting the lava oozing across a summit crater.",
      "Scientists expect Kilauea volcano to again gush lava in the coming days for the 31st time since December as the mountain lives up to its identity of one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes.",
      "A few lucky residents and visitors will have a front row view at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. If the past is a guide, hundreds of thousands more will be watching popular livestreams made possible by three camera angles set up by the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Whenever she gets word the lava is back, Park Service volunteer Janice Wei hustles to shoot photos and videos of Halemaumau Crater \u2014 which Native Hawaiian tradition says is the home to the volcano goddess Pele. She said when the molten rock shoots high like a fountain it sounds like a roaring jet engine or crashing ocean waves. She can feel its heat from over a mile away.",
      "\u201cEvery eruption feels like I am sitting in the front row at nature\u2019s most extraordinary show,\u201d Wei said in an email.",
      "Kilauea is on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It\u2019s about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the state\u2019s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.",
      "Here's what to know about Kilauea's latest eruption:",
      "A lower magma chamber under Halemaumau Crater is receiving magma directly from the earth\u2019s interior about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there, it gets pushed above ground through cracks.",
      "Magma has been using the same pathway to rise to the surface since December, making the initial release and subsequent episodes all part of the same eruption, Hon said.",
      "Many have featured lava soaring into the air, in some cases more than 1,000 feet (300 meters). The fountains are generated in part because magma \u2014 which holds gasses that are released as it rises \u2014 has been traveling to the surface through narrow, pipe-like vents.",
      "The expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.",
      "This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: the eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains. Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area so few got to watch.",
      "The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.",
      "Scientists don't know how the current eruption will end or how it may change. In 1983, magma built enough pressure that Kilauea opened a vent at a lower elevation and started continuously leaking lava from there rather than periodically shooting out of a higher elevation. The eruption continued in various forms for three decades and only ended in 2018.",

      "Scientists can estimate a few days or even a week ahead of time when lava is likely to emerge with the help of sensors around the volcano that detect earthquakes and miniscule changes in the angle of the ground, which indicate when magma is inflating or deflating.",
      "\u201cOur job is like being a bunch of ants crawling on an elephant trying to figure out how the elephant works,\u201d Hon said.",
      "The lava fountains have been shorter lately. Steve Lundblad, a University of Hawaii at Hilo geology professor, said the vent may have gotten wider, leaving molten rock less pressurized.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still gonna have spectacular eruptions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to be be wider and not as high.\u201d",
      "Some people may see lava flows as destructive. But Huihui Kanahele-Mossman, the executive director of the Edith Kanaka\u02bbole Foundation, said lava is a natural resource that hardens into land and forms the foundation for everything on Hawaii Island.",
      "Kanahele-Mossman's nonprofit is named after her grandmother \u2014 the esteemed practitioner of Hawaiian language and culture, and founder of a noted hula halau, or school. H\u0101lau o Kekuhi is celebrated for its mastery of a style of hula rooted in the stories of Pele and her sister, Hi\u02bbiaka.",
      "Kanahele-Mossman has visited the crater a few times since the eruption began. She initially watches in awe and reverence. But then she observes more details so she can go home and compare it to the lava in the centuries-old tales that her school performs. At the crater, she delivers a chant prepared in advance and places offerings. Recently she presented awa, a drink made with kava, and a fern lei.",
      "\u201cYou as the dancer, you are the storyteller and you carry that history that was written in those mele forward,\u201d she said, using the Hawaiian word for song. \u201cTo be able to actually see that eruption that\u2019s described in the mele, that\u2019s always exciting to us and drives us and motivates us to stay in this tradition.\u201d",
      "Park visitation has risen all eight months of the year so far, in part because of the eruption. In April, there were 49% more visitors than the same month of 2024.",
      "Park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane noted that the last several episodes have only lasted about 10 to 12 hours. Those wanting to go should sign up for U.S. Geological Survey alert notifications because the eruption could be over before you know it, she said.",
      "She cautioned that visitors should stay on marked trails and overlooks because unstable cliff edges and earth cracks may not be immediately apparent and falling could lead to serious injury or death. People should also keep young children close.",
      "Volcanic gas, glass and ash can also be dangerous. Those visiting at night should bring a flashlight.",

      "A Maryland ticket broker is accused of illegally purchasing and reselling hundreds of thousands of tickets for profit, including thousands to\u00a0Taylor Swift's highly sought Eras Tour.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission is suing Key Investment Group, saying the company made millions of dollars in profit from reselling the tickets at inflated prices.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Monday, Aug. 18, in U.S. District Court in Maryland, accuses the company and its affiliates of bypassing Ticketmaster's security measures designed to block resellers from violating ticket-purchase limits.",
      "Key Investment Group also did business under the names Epic Seats, TotalTickets.com LLC and Totally Tix LLC, according to the complaint.",
      "The FTC alleges that, in a one year period, the group purchased at least 379,776 tickets from Ticketmaster at a cost of nearly $57 million. The company then allegedly resold those tickets on secondary marketplaces for about $64 million.",
      "In a statement, Key Investment Group said it will \"vigorously defend itself against this clear example of regulatory overreach.\" It claims the FTC \"misleadingly characterizes KIG's use of standard internet browsers,\" and said the government's case \"threatens to dismantle the secondary ticket market for live events.\"",
      "Taylor Swift's Eras Tour tickets",
      "Between March and August of 2023, Key Investment Group allegedly purchased 10 or more tickets to 38 Taylor Swift concerts, totaling 2,280 tickets, according to the complaint. The FTC says the company made more than $1.2 million in profit reselling those tickets.",

      "According to the FTC, the group used thousands of Ticketmaster accounts, both fictitious and third-party accounts it had purchased, to bypass security measures and purchase the tickets.",
      "The company is also accused of using thousands of credit card numbers, including virtual card numbers, spoofing IP addresses to hide the identity of the ticket purchaser, and using SIM technology to collect the incoming verification codes.",
      "In doing so, the FTC said the brokers violated the FTC Act and the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, which prohibits people from \"circumventing a security measure, access control system, or other technological control or measure on an internet website or online service that is used by the ticket issuer to enforce posted event ticket limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online ticket purchasing order rules.\"",

    "story": [
      "The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021 began on Monday.",
      "Hernandez Govan, 45, faces charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder. He is not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claim he directed the\u00a0two people\u00a0who did. He rejected the state's offer to settle with a guilty plea last month,\u00a0CBS affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "City officials and community activists pointed to the killing as a symbol of the dangers of gun violence in Memphis, where more than 300 homicides were reported that year.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed the killing as part an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, Yo Gotti.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Testifying against Govan on Monday was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the\u00a0two shooters\u00a0who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against\u00a0Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter. Smith had previously testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph, as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date. Johnson was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in September 2024.\u00a0He was later sentenced\u00a0for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "Smith testified on Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the volunteer event, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said that Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \"King of Memphis.\" He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020\u2032s \"Rich Slave\" peaking at No. 4.",
      "He was among the musical stars that The Grammy Awards paid tribute to during its memoriam segment at the 2022 awards.",
      "In a\u00a02024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a \"very senseless murder\" and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.",
      "The attack that killed the rapper wasn't the first time he was targeted. In 2017, Young Dolph was approached by three men and shot over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was critically injured but survived. Earlier that same year, he was involved in another shooting, where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",

      "The magnetic British actor Terence Stamp (July 22, 1938-Aug. 17, 2025) earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his first film appearance, in 1962's \"Billy Budd.\" But he was best known for playing the supervillain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II.\" His other major film roles included a kidnapper in \"The Collector,\" a London criminal in \"The Limey,\" and a trans woman accompanying two drag queens in a romp across the Australian Outback in the comedy \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"",
      "Born in London, Stamp worked in advertising before pursuing an acting career. Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.",
      "At a 2013 British Film Institute screening, Stamp said he was living in an ashram when he got a telegram offering him the part of Zod opposite Marlon Brando. \"And I thought, my life is about to change,\" he said.",
      "His performance as the ruthless exile from Krypton who wields the same superpowers as Superman was indelible, as was his desire to dominate the Earth.

      "His film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.",
      "He published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"",
      "In 1987,\u00a0Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\""

    "summary": "Whimsical and romantic, the music of Icelandic singer and cellist Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir blends pop, jazz, classical and bossa nova \u2013 a \"mishmash,\" she calls it. Her latest album is \"A Matter of Time.\"",
    "story": [
      "Laufey's music may not be what you usually think of as \"pop,\" but if pop is short for popular, then she is indeed a pop star. The 26-year-old Icelander has earned a devoted following blending modern lyrics and music with classical and jazz. \"My music is such a combination of the sounds of my childhood,\" she said. \"It's just something that's become a part of me. I wanted to make things that made me happy.",
      "\"I loved Golden Age musicals,\" said Laufey. \"I'd watch 'Carousel' and 'Oklahoma' and 'American in Paris' and 'Sound of Music.' They were so beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were floating and the colors \u2013 that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to create that feeling.\"",
      "The world she inhabits (in her work, anyway) is whimsical and romantic, full of windswept cliffs, frilly dresses and bows \u2026 and cello, almost always cello.",
      "Watch Laufey perform \"I Wish You Love\" with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra:",
      "She says the cello is \"as important to me as my voice. And I think it's really what makes a Laufey song a Laufey song.\"",
      "Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir comes by it naturally. Her Icelandic father introduced her to jazz when she was a girl; her Chinese mother played classical violin. So does Laufey's identical twin sister.",
      "Growing up, she said, she felt different: \"Everyone was like, you know, going to play soccer after school or dance, and I was sitting down and playing music from the 17th century. And then on top that I was a twin, identical twin. I just feel, like, weird on top of weird, on top of weird.\"",
      "And things only got weirder when she started singing, as when she appeared on the TV competition \"Iceland's Got Talent\" singing Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You,\" at age 13: \"I remember going on singing competitions in Iceland when I was younger and they'd always be like, 'She sounds like a 40-year-old woman that's been divorced twice and she chain-smokes cigarettes,'' Laufey said. \"And I was, like, a 13-year-old girl standing on stage being like, okay, like, I just wanted to be a girl. So, yeah I was always a little bit like \u2026 felt a little bit like a circus act.\"",
      "But Laufey found her footing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She started posting original songs and jazz covers on social media during the pandemic, and they quickly went viral.",
      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",
      "Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere Voices echo in the gym Another girl's had her first kiss Please don't think too much of it, darling",
      "I asked, \"What do you think your 13-year-old self would think of all of this?\"",
      "\"I think she'd be really excited,\" Laufey replied. \"I think she'd be really happy. There's not a single part of myself that has changed any of my artistic interests to follow some sort of trend. And I get to make exactly the music that I loved back then. So, I think I would've been really, really happy.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:45:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The former \"Parks and Recreation\" star heads the surreal, critically-acclaimed series about workers at a mysterious corporation whose brains are altered to create distinctly separate personalities in and out of the office.",
    "story": [
      "Adam Scott was once a solid \"that guy\" \u2013 a steadily working actor you might recognize from any number of roles. He's been active since the early nineties, playing everything from Howard Hughes' press agent in \"The Aviator,\" to a pompous jerk in \"Step Brothers.\" He's acted in large ensemble television shows like \"Party Down\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But in 2022, when ads started popping up for a new Apple TV+ show called \"Severance,\" with his face front and center, it was a new experience for Scott.",
      "\"It was terrifying, like, truly,\" he said. \"As an actor, it's something you wait your entire career for, your entire life for. But when it happened, I was immediately terrified, and didn't quite know why. I guess I was afraid that it was just gonna end up being embarrassing, and people were gonna make fun of us, and make fun of me.\"",
      "Quite the opposite. \"Severance\" ended up becoming a critically acclaimed hit. The show's second season is nominated for more Emmys than any other show this year (27 in all), including outstanding drama series, and a lead actor nomination for Scott.",
      "Scott's character, Mark, works for a mysterious, seemingly sinister corporation. When he's off the clock, he has no memory of his work life. He is a \"severed\" employee \u2013 a device in his brain separates his office self from his home self.",
      "In this scene, Mark S. (Adam Scott) meets his non-office self, Mark Scout, through video recordings:",
      "I said, \"A lot of people relate to 'Severance' because of that sentiment of like, 'Wouldn't it be nice to turn your brain off from 9:00 to 5:00 and not do my mind-numbing job?'\u00a0 It sounds like you never really had a job like that, though. How do you tap into that?\"",
      "\"It's funny, because the things that ended up really sort of making a difference in my career were, like, 'Parks and Rec' and 'Party Down' and 'Severance,'\" said Scott. \"They are largely shows that are about work. And these are jobs that I've never actually had to participate in in real life, 'cause I was always in a play or doing a guest spot on 'NYPD Blue' or whatever. I guess I relate to these kind of feelings that these characters have because it's been sort of this long path for me in show business.\"",
      "Scott's path began in his hometown of Santa Cruz, California, where he'd spend hours in his room watching, and imitating, actors he saw on David Letterman.",
      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

      "Taylor Swift's upcoming album release and her love of all things orange isn't lost on her fans \u2014 or brands that are seeking a ride on what has become an enormous economic tailwind.",
      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",
      "\"It feels like energetically how my life has felt,\" the 14-time Grammy winner tells co-host Jason Kelce.",
      "Many, it seemed, saw value in tying their brand to Swift.",
      "More than a dozen NHL teams, both\u00a0north\u00a0and\u00a0south\u00a0of the Canadian border, followed with posts on social media acknowledging Swift's new album.",

      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",

The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

      "\"By the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do,\" she said. \"This was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators and it was really special.\"",

      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",
      "Swift described the theme of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" as \"everything that was going on behind the curtain\" during the Eras Tour.",

      "The pop star added that there are no additional songs, a departure from past albums. Her most recent release, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" had 31 songs.",
      "\"Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. \u2026 It's just right,\" she said. \"That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.",
      "\"I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it's a temptation to release lots of music. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle.\"",
      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "\"My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it and lyrics that are just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional,\" she said.",
      "Martin had made a point to tell Swift he didn't want her to leave behind the type of writing and storytelling she did on \"folklore\" (released in July 2020) even if the sound of this album was different. Swift said she replied, \"I couldn't if I tried.\"",

    "story": [
      "S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed its AA+ credit rating for the U.S., saying that new revenue raised by the Trump administration's tariffs will help offset the tax cuts authorized by the Republicans' \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
      "The credit ratings agency, which issued its new assessment of the nation's fiscal health late Monday, said that it is holding its AA+/A-1+ rating steady, with a stable outlook.",
      "The fresh analysis comes after Moody's Ratings, another large credit ratings agency, downgraded the U.S. in May, highlighting investor concerns about the nation's growing debt and policy uncertainty sparked by President Trump's trade policies. While S&P highlighted a range of economic concerns in its report, including the impact of new tax cuts against a backdrop of already high U.S. debt and deficits, the agency also underscored the resiliency of the nation's economy as well as the new tariff revenue generated by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Amid the rise in effective tariff rates, we expect meaningful tariff revenue to generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes that might otherwise be associated with the recent fiscal legislation, which contains both cuts and increases in tax and spending,\" S&P analysts wrote in the ratings note.",
      "The report added, \"The ratings on the U.S. are based on its wealthy, diversified and resilient economy, with per capita GDP over $89,000 in 2025. Since the pandemic, U.S. growth has far surpassed that of its peers.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The fresh ratings assessment comes as the U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown, with GDP decelerating to an average rate of 1.25% during the first half of the year, compared with 2.8% in 2024. The job market also faltered in July, with employers adding a disappointing 73,000 jobs last month,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department \u2014 far fewer than economists had forecast.",
      "The weak jobs data suggests that businesses are delaying hiring amid the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's new tariff regime, which has been exacerbated by numerous postponements and rate changes.",
      "Amid those headwinds, the revenue generated from tariffs is surging: The U.S. government collected about $30 billion from import duties\u00a0in July, according to the Treasury Department. That amounts to a 242% jump in tariff revenue since July 2024.",
      "While that new revenue will help bolster the nation's finances, it comes at a cost to American consumers and businesses, economists say. Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers \u2014 from\u00a0small businesses to large retailers and manufacturers \u2014 when they accept goods from foreign countries at U.S. ports. Typically, those businesses then raise their prices to cover the costs of these duties, according to economists.",
      "Because of that dynamic, tariffs are viewed as a tax on consumers by economists, with the Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank,\u00a0estimating that the new import duties will cost the average taxpayer about $2,700 in additional costs in 2026.",

      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

    "summary": "The union representing 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants says it's reached a tentative agreement with the carrier and their strike, which had entered its fourth day, is over.",
    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014 Air Canada said Tuesday it will restart operations gradually after a tentative agreement was reached with the union for 10,000 flight attendants to end a strike that disrupted the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of passengers.",
      "The Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, made the announcement\u00a0on its Facebook page\u00a0early Tuesday.",
      "It came after the union and Air Canada resumed talks late Monday for the first time since the strike began over the weekend. The walkout affected about 130,000 travelers a day at the peak of the summer travel season.",
      "Canada's largest airline said flights will start resuming Tuesday evening.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "The union said the agreement will guarantee members pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, resolving one of the major issues that drove the strike.",
      "\"Unpaid work is over. We have reclaimed our voice and our power,\" the union said in a statement. \"When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back \u2014 and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on.\"",
      "Air Canada Chief Executive Michael Rousseau said restarting a major carrier is a complex undertaking and said regular service may require seven to 10 days. Some flights will be canceled until the schedule is stabilized.",
      "\"Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,\" Rousseau said in a statement.",
      "The two sides reached the deal with the help of a mediator early Tuesday morning. The airline said mediation discussions \"were begun on the basis that the union commit to have the airline's 10,000 flight attendants immediately return to work.\" Air Canada declined to comment further on the agreement until the ratification process is complete. It noted a strike or lockout is not possible during this time.",
      "The union said it is \"required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,\" adding that the talks that settled the strike began at 7 p.m. Monday lasted until 4:23 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, Air Canada said rolling cancellations would extend through Tuesday afternoon after the union defied a second return-to-work order.",
      "The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal Monday and ordered the flight attendants back on the job. But the union said it would defy the directive. Union leaders also ignored a weekend order to submit to binding arbitration and end the strike by Sunday afternoon.",
      "The board is an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws. The government ordered the board to intervene.",
      "Labor leaders objected to the Canadian government's repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere.",
      "\"Your right to vote on your wages was preserved,\" the union said in a post on its website.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day. The airline estimated Monday that 500,000 customers would be affected by flight cancellations.",
      "Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Monday afternoon, Air Canada had called off at least 1,219 domestic flights and 1,339 international flights since last Thursday, when the carrier began gradually suspending its operations ahead of the strike and lockout that began early Saturday.",
      "Toronto's Pearson International Airport, Canada's largest, said it will deploy additional staff to assist passengers and support startup operations.",
      "Passengers whose flights are impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline's website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.",

    "story": [
      "As students savor the last dregs of summer before heading back to school, many families are shopping for supplies earlier this year to get ahead of tariffs.",
      "Over half of U.S. households that earn less than $50,000 a year say they plan to buy only essential school items, while 74% say they are shopping earlier than usual to avoid a potential hit from tariffs,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization that opposes higher import duties.",
      "Many back-to-school essentials, from clothing and footwear to personal electronics, are imported. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0estimates that the U.S. tariff rate on such goods has jumped to an average of 18% this year, more than triple the 5% rate in 2024.",
      "Families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade are projected to spend an average of $858 on clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics this year, NRF found. That's down slightly from $875 in 2024, as inflation has continued to ease this year, although up sharply from $697 in 2019, the group's data shows.",
      "Record high prices",
      "Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0shows\u00a0that the cost of school supplies and books is at a record high. A recent analysis from The Century Foundation also found that prices for a typical assortment of school supplies are up more than 7% in price this year, with goods such index cards and binders subject to even steeper price hikes.",
      "School supplies cut across a range of goods categories, from dorm room d\u00e9cor, clothing and personal electronics to staples including writing implements, notebooks and backpacks.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "Although steep new U.S. tariffs haven't delivered the kind of shock to the economy that some forecasters expected, many consumers are worried, shopping expert Trae Bodge told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"All of the studies that I'm seeing are showing that consumers are concerned,\" Bodge said. \"We are seeing prices ticking up because of tariffs, because of inflation. And so people are worried about being able to afford the things they need for school.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge \u2014 rose 2.7% in July on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "How to save",
      "Large retailers are rolling out deep discounts on some school supplies, with items like notebooks, folders, crayons and erasers selling for less than $1.",
      "For big-ticket items, experts urge consumers to compare prices. That includes cross-checking in-store prices against online deals. For example, a $269 Samsung Galaxy tablet at one retailer was available for $220 on its app. Most retailers also will match the best price on their own websites, Bodge noted.",
      "When it comes to personal electronics, many of which are imported and now subject to President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs, Bodge urges consumers to consider buying refurbished models.",
      "\"A lot of retailers offer refurbished items that also come with a warranty, and that's a really good option if you're looking to save,\" she said.",
      "When it comes to products like pencils and notebooks, buying a store-brand over a name-brand also often offers savings. For clothes, experts advise waiting until school starts \u2014 when kids ask for whatever is trendy, you'll have a little money left over.",
      "Another way to both manage your budget while imparting a lesson on spending is to give teens a gift card, Bodge said. \"So they will be much more careful spending their money versus your money. And they'll stay on budget by doing this,\" she told CBS News.",

      "Read on to learn more about the federal holiday, including what's open on Labor Day and what sales are to be had in 2025.",
      "When is Labor Day?",
      "This year, Labor Day falls on Monday, Sept.1.",
      "What is the history of Labor Day?",
      "Nowadays, Labor Day is more commonly associated with barbecues and beach days, but the federal holiday was created to celebrate the hard-won rights of American workers.",
      "Before early labor laws came into play in the 20th century, the average U.S. worker's schedule spanned 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, with low wages and little protections, according to\u00a0History.com.",
      "The culmination of years of strikes and protests by American workers to secure better job conditions, Labor Day was signed into law on June 28, 1894, by President Grover Cleveland.",
      "The civilian workforce in America is around 170 million people strong as of June 2025, data from Statista shows. While there's no cap on the number of hours Americans can work per week, federal law mandates that workers be paid a minimum wage.",
      "That wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. However, many cities and states across the country have passed legislation to enforce higher minimums adjusted for today's cost of living. Most recently in July, the minimum wage was raised in 15 states and cities.",
      "What stores are open and closed on Labor Day?",
      "Big-box retailers including Target, Walgreens and Walmart, will keep their doors open on Sept. 1.",

While Kroger's website says its stores will be operating at regular hours on Sept. 1, Whole Foods recommends you check your local store's webpage on Labor Day for hours of operation.",
      "Fast-food chains, including\u00a0Starbucks and\u00a0Taco Bell, will also be open to serve customers on Sept. 1. While some, like Starbucks, will be operating at regular hours, other chains recommend checking ahead for local store hours, which may be limited on holidays.",

    "summary": "Incomes are still trailing inflation four years after the pandemic-era surge in prices, causing a financial pinch for many households.",
    "story": [
      "Wages still haven't caught up with inflation, four years after the pandemic caused prices to soar and created a cost-of-living crisis for many households, a new study finds.",
      "Americans on average are earning 1.2 percentage points below the rise in the cost of living over the past four years, which means that the typical worker's pay increases over that time haven't yet caught up to higher prices, according to Bankrate's 2025 Wage to Inflation Index.",
      "The findings come as Americans remain sour about the economy, with 55% rating it as either very or fairly bad, according to a July poll from CBS News. Three-quarters said their incomes haven't kept up with inflation, while a majority also said they've seen prices creep higher in recent weeks and also expect that to continue.",
      "But some professions are falling further behind than others, with educators seeing the biggest gap between income growth and inflation during the past four years, the study found. Teachers have long struggled with a \"wage gap,\" meaning that they typically earn less than college graduates working in other fields, due to issues such as constraints on school funding,\u00a0according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"Wage growth is often a reflection of who has the power in the labor market,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If there are more job openings than workers to fill them, businesses will often lift pay to retain or attract talent.\"",
      "She added, \"On the flip side, if there are too few job openings, companies don't have to work as hard to keep workers because they have nowhere to really go.\"",
      "Overall, the 1.2 percentage point gap between the typical workers' pay growth and inflation during the past four years signals that many households are continuing to feel financial strain, Foster added. Even before the pandemic, millions of Americans were\u00a0struggling to save for emergencies.",
      "\"Wages not keeping up with inflation translate to outright purchasing-power destruction,\" Foster said. \"These are funds that households could be using to stash away for their goals, like saving for retirement and a home, or building up their safety nets and emergency fund.\"",
      "The professions that have outpaced inflation include those that saw a spike in demand after the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality workers, she added. \"Health care, meanwhile, is driving job growth lately, accounting for 88% of private-sector payroll growth last month,\" Foster said.",
      "Wage dissatisfaction",
      "Only about 54% of Americans say they are satisfied with their current wages, according to a new analysis from Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That represents the lowest satisfaction level since the NY Fed began tracking the measure in 2014.",
      "Even high-income households, which contribute about\u00a0half of all consumer spending\u00a0and drive economic growth, are facing bigger financial hurdles, including surging delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans, according to recent research.",
      "For instance, the share of all new jobs that pay above-average wages has fallen to 7% this year, down from 38% prior to 2020, according to credit-scoring company VantageScore. That can make it tougher for professionals to find new jobs if they suffer a job loss, the group noted.",
      "Workers in white-collar industries like finance and business services \"speak of a frozen job market,\" Foster noted. \"Employed workers in the sector can't find anywhere else to go and unemployed workers struggle to find new work.\"",

Air Canada then said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening. But when the workers refused, the airline said it would resume flights Monday evening instead. However, there was no sign that the Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, would relent.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",
      "What Air Canada is offering",
      "Union leader Hancock on Sunday had ripped up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport, and said members wouldn't go back to work this week, to the cheers of picketing flight attendants.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",
      "The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years. That deal \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada,\" according to the carrier.",
      "But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.",

MSNBC and several other cable channels owned by NBC Universal are spinning off into a new business called Versant, which will also include financial news channel CNBC and entertainment networks such as USA, Oxygen, E! and SYFY.",
      "Comcast, the owner of NBC Universal, announced the spinoff in November amid struggling ratings for the cable industry as a whole.

      "To be sure, name changes always carry an inherent risk, and MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler said that for employees, it is hard to imagine the network under a different name. \"This was not a decision that was made quickly or without significant debate,\" she said in a memo to staff.",
      "\"During this time of transition, NBC Universal decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity,\" she wrote. \"This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our indepedence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering organization.\"",
      "In preparation for the spinoff, MSNBC has hired more than three-dozen journalists from outlets including Bloomberg, Politico, the Washington Post and CNN, the company said.

    "summary": "Miners want to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
    "story": [
      "A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\"These impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\" said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \"Our enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\"",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres, rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "Dramatic landscape changes come with modern mining",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Gold tends to be a stable asset,\" he said. \"That actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That's why gold as an asset in investment.\"",
      "President Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Mining brings revenue, but renews Black Hills fight",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",
      "According to data provided by Dakota Gold, they believe the net present value for the deposits could range from $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion, CBS affiliate KELO-TV reported last month.",
      "Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\"Most of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\" he said. \"So we're a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\"",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\"There's a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\" said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \"It's not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It's the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\"",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold's mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur's environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\" The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Lakota People's Law Project\u00a0and the\u00a0Black Hills Clean Water Alliance have also voiced opposition to the proposed drilling and mining for gold in the area, KELO-TV reported.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\"It's really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that's been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\" Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That's 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\"",

Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador only to be brought back to face smuggling charges \u2014 asked a federal judge to dismiss his indictment.",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador only to be brought back to the U.S. to face smuggling charges, asked a federal judge in Nashville on Tuesday to dismiss his indictment, calling it a \"vindictive and selective prosecution\" by the Trump administration.",
      "The attorneys claimed the Trump administration is only prosecuting Abrego Garcia for alleged human smuggling crimes because he challenged his deportation to El Salvador, where he was initially held at the notorious mega-prison known as CECOT. His lawyers have said their client was beaten at that prison before being transferred to a lower-level security facility.",
      "Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 at age 16 and was granted legal protection from being deported to his home country of El Salvador in 2019. But he was still arrested by immigration officials and deported there earlier this year.",
      "While the Trump administration initially conceded in federal court that his deportation to El Salvador had been a mistake, it has since sought to undermine Abrego Garcia's case in the court of public opinion, accusing him of being a gang member, highlighting domestic violence allegations and charging him with smuggling.",
      "Abrego Garcia has remained in pre-trial detention since he was flown back to the U.S. in early June. The Justice Department has alleged in its criminal indictment that before his deportation to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia transported immigrants, including minors, who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally as part of a smuggling conspiracy.",
      "One of the main pieces of evidence cited by prosecutors is a 2022 traffic stop during which Tennessee troopers stopped Abrego Garcia as he was driving nine people without any luggage across state lines. Abrego Garcia's lawyers said it was telling that the federal government did not prosecute him until after his deportation, which gained widespread national attention.",
      "\"Indeed, the only possible explanation for the timing of the charges here is that the government chose to use this prosecution to punish Mr. Abrego for exercising his right to challenge the violations of due process that led to his unconstitutional deportation, incarceration, and torture in El Salvador,\" the lawyers said in a legal filing.",
      "\"This, coupled with the government's statements clearly showing the intent to retaliate against Mr. Abrego for pursuing civil remedies for his illegal deportation, unquestionably establishes discriminatory intent,\" the filing continued.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said the Trump administration had \"gone to extreme lengths to make a criminal case,\" including by using a convicted smuggler who has been deported five times as its \"star cooperator.\" They said the witness was getting lenient treatment from the government in exchange for his cooperation, even though he was purportedly the head of a smuggling business and Abrego Garcia was \"allegedly a mere driver.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers are also asking the federal court in Nashville to order their client's release from pre-trial detention once a stay on that order lapses on Friday, Aug. 22. While the court ordered Abrego Garcia's pre-trial release earlier this summer, it paused that order after his lawyers expressed concerns that their client would be immediately detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and processed for deportation.",
      "If he's released, the lawyers asked the court to give Abrego Garcia 48 hours to report to pre-trial supervision in Maryland. If there's a release hearing, the lawyers asked the court to order the U.S. Marshals Service to transport Abrego Garcia from the court back to the detention facility where he's being held, so he can be released from there. The attorneys said they've hired a private security group to take Abrego Garcia from Tennessee to Maryland.",
      "In July, a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia to Maryland, where he lived with his U.S. citizen wife and child, so he can be supervised by ICE there. She also blocked ICE from immediately re-detaining him in Tennessee and from deporting him without some degree of notice, but did not forbid the possibility of the agency re-arresting him in Maryland.",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives for the Department of Justice asking for comment on Tuesday's legal filings.",
      "In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said Abrego Garcia \"will never walk America's streets again,\" calling him a \"gang member and human trafficker.\"",

Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the Defense Department.",

Scott's chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, told Vermont Public that while public safety is a \"legitimate concern\" in cities across the country, \"the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as proper use of the National Guard.\"",
      "The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.",
      "By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.",
      "A White House official\u00a0told CBS News on Saturday that National Guard members deployed to D.C. \"may be armed,\" but that they would not make arrests. This was a reversal from earlier in the week, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.",
      "\"The National Guard is not making arrests at this time \u2013 they may be armed, consistent with their mission and training, to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence,\" the White House official said Saturday.",
      "A protest against Mr. Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday afternoon before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said \"No fascist takeover of D.C.,\" and some in the crowd held signs that said \"No military occupation.\" Mr. Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",

      "On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an \"emergency police commissioner\" after the district's top lawyer sued to contest.

    "story": [
      "Rep. Nicole Collier, the Democratic state lawmaker who spent Monday night inside the Texas Capitol, is asking a court to let her exit the building, alleging she's facing \"illegal restraint by the government\" after she was told she needs a police escort to leave.",
      "The Fort Worth lawmaker and dozens of other Democrats left Texas earlier this month to delay a vote on a GOP-led plan to redraw the state's congressional map. The Democrats returned to Texas in recent days and they were given state police escorts to ensure they will show up when the state House convenes Wednesday, but Collier refused to sign a \"permission slip\" to be under escort by the Texas Department of Public Safety. Collier says she slept on the House floor overnight.",
      "Collier told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" on Tuesday that several other Democrats \"tore up their permission slips\" and will join her on the House floor Tuesday night.",
      "\"I refuse to comply with this unreasonable, un-American and unnecessary request,\" Collier said.",
      "Meanwhile, in a habeas corpus application filed in Austin state court on Monday, lawyers for Collier alleged \"illegal confinement.\"",
      "This was my night, bonnet and all, in the #txlege. #thisisme pic.twitter.com/46YgqbMUk8",
      "The petition says state Rep. Charlie Geren, a Republican who chairs the House Administration Committee, told Collier: \"If you leave the Capitol you are subject to arrest.\" Collier's petition does not mention the state police escorts.",
      "Collier's attorneys argue that's illegal. They acknowledged that Texas law allows lawmakers who are absent from the Capitol to face civil arrest, but they say state officials have no legal right to detain legislators who are already present at the Capitol to ensure they don't leave.",
      "\"The plain language is clear: a member may be compelled by the Sergeant-at-Arms to attend a legislative session if he or she is physically absent, but no such power is conferred on the Legislature to arrest or otherwise compel a member who is currently present (and not absent) to stay,\" the Democrat's court petition read.",
      "Collier, a seven-term lawmaker and former chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, is asking a judge to order the House Sergeant-at-Arms to \"immediately release\" her, and to bar the Sergeant-at-Arms from \"restraining Representative Collier in any respect.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Geren, House Speaker Dustin Burrows and the Texas Department of Public Safety for comment.",
      "The Texas House is set to reconvene on Wednesday at 10 a.m., when lawmakers are expected to move forward on a mid-decade redistricting effort that was pushed by President Trump. The new congressional maps could give Republicans a boost in next year's midterm elections, as the party aims to hold onto its narrow edge in the U.S. House.",
      "The plan was temporarily derailed earlier this month when dozens of Democratic members of the Texas House left the state in protest, denying House Republicans a quorum for the final two weeks of a special legislative session called by Gov. Greg Abbott to redraw the congressional maps. Republican officials threatened to seek Democrats' arrest or push from their removal from the legislature unless they returned to the state Capitol.",
      "Abbott called another special session starting Wednesday. Republicans are widely expected to pass the redistricting plan, given their decisive majorities in the state House and Senate.",
      "The plan has sparked nationwide recrimination from Democrats, with blue states like California and New York floating their own redistricting efforts. One plan in California could create five more Democratic-leaning seats, offsetting Texas's efforts.",

    "story": [
      "Internal government documents obtained by CBS News show the Trump administration has expanded its campaign to persuade countries around the world to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.",
      "The documents indicate Uganda in East Africa recently agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who hail from other countries on the continent, as long as they don't have criminal histories. It's unclear how many deportees Uganda would ultimately accept under the arrangement with the U.S. government.",
      "Honduras' government has also agreed to receive deportees from other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, including families traveling with children, the documents show. The government of Honduras agreed to a relatively small number of deportations \u2014 just several hundred over two years \u2014 but the documents indicate it could decide to accept more.",
      "Both agreements are based on a \"safe third country\" provision of U.S. immigration law that allows officials to reroute asylum-seekers to countries that are not their own if the U.S. government makes a determination that those nations can fairly hear their claims for humanitarian protection.",
      "The two bilateral deals outlined in the internal documents are part of a large-scale diplomatic effort that President Trump's administration has staged to strike deportation arrangements with nations across several continents, including those with problematic human rights records. The administration has argued those agreements are key to its mass deportation campaign, since there are some migrants who can't easily be deported to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.",
      "At least a dozen countries have already accepted or agreed to accept deportees from other nations since the second Trump administration took office, and U.S. officials have been aggressively courting other governments. Internal government documents show the Trump administration has also asked countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive these so-called third country deportees from the U.S.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "A senior State Department official said, \"We don't comment on the content of private diplomatic negotiations, but the State Department is doing everything possible to support the President's policy of keeping Americans safe by removing illegal aliens who have no right to be in the United States.\"",
      "Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to deport migrants to third countries with a minimal degree of notice and due process. The decision paved the way for the administration to continue expanding a practice it has relied on since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "In February, the Trump administration convinced Costa Rica and Panama to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Then, in March, the U.S. flew more than 200 Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they were held incommunicado for months at a notorious prison until they were returned to Venezuela last month under a prisoner swap.",
      "The administration has also sent immigrants convicted of violent crimes and who hail from Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Yemen and other countries to violence-torn South Sudan and the tiny southern African kingdom of Eswatini. Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.",
      "Last week, the State Department said the U.S. had signed a \"safe third country\" asylum agreement with Paraguay. Mexico, under an arrangement that predates Mr. Trump's second term, accepts the return of some Latin American migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "Human rights advocates have strongly denounced the Trump administration effort, saying migrants could be deported to countries where they could be harmed or returned to the place they fled. Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.",
      "In a report released last week, the State Department described \"negative developments in the human rights situation in Uganda,\" citing unlawful killings, \"arbitrary\" arrests, disappearances and a lack of action from the government to curb human rights abuses. The report also noted, however, that Uganda has worked with United Nations officials to provide humanitarian protection to refugees.",
      "Doris Meissner, who oversaw the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Clinton administration, said the U.S. government has long faced difficulties deporting some migrants due to diplomatic constraints. But she noted efforts to deport them to third countries were generally undertaken in \"exceptional\" cases only.",
      "Meissner, who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute think tank,  suggested the Trump administration may be employing different sources of leverage \u2014 like threats of visa sanctions and funding commitments \u2014 to persuade as many countries as possible to take in deportees from other nations.",
      "Noting deportations to third countries remain relatively limited in scale, Meissner said a main driver behind the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts is a desire to send a message of deterrence to those in the U.S. illegally, one that highlights the possibility that they could be sent to distant countries where they have no ties.",
      "\"The broader reason beyond that is fear and intimidation and ultimately, incentivizing self deportation,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A federal judge tossed out part of a lawsuit brought by detainees at the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center in the Florida Everglades, handing a partial victory to the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday tossed out part of a lawsuit brought by detainees at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, handing a partial victory to the Trump administration and Florida state officials \u2014 though other challenges over \"Alligator Alcatraz\" are still pending.",
      "Civil rights attorneys had sued the Trump administration and the state of Florida, seeking a preliminary injunction to ensure that detainees at the facility have confidential access to lawyers. It's the second lawsuit challenging practices at Alligator Alcatraz, a controversial detention facility that the Trump administration has cast as a symbol of its crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 along with a suit arguing the facility had skirted environmental rules.",
      "But after a hearing on Monday, Miami-based U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz dismissed one part of their suit that alleged the government was violating the Fifth Amendment because it hadn't made clear for weeks which immigration court had jurisdiction over Alligator Alcatraz, preventing detainees from filing court petitions. Ruiz ruled that this claim is now moot because the government has since said publicly that the court at the Krome Detention Center in South Florida will hear the detainees' claims.",
      "\"The Court can do no more,\" Ruiz wrote.",
      "The judge did not dismiss several other claims that the government is violating the First Amendment by allegedly making it difficult for detainees to talk to their lawyers, especially in confidential settings. Ruiz said that continues to be a \"live controversy.\" But he ordered the case to be transferred to a different federal court, because Alligator Alcatraz is technically within the boundaries of the Orlando-based Middle District of Florida.",
      "Eunice Cho, an attorney at the ACLU of Florida who served as lead counsel for the lawsuit, said in a statement: \"We secured an important victory \u2014 because of this lawsuit, the federal government has decided to reverse course and is now allowing immigrants held at 'Alligator Alcatraz' the ability to petition the immigration court for release from detention \u2014 which the government should never have blocked them from doing in the first place.\"",
      "The federal government has denied that defendants are prevented from meeting with attorneys.",
      "\"Any allegation that illegal aliens at Alligator Alcatraz do not have access to attorneys is FALSE. The facility maintains a physical space for attorneys to meet with their clients. Additionally, Florida established an email address for attorneys to submit requests to speak to the specific illegal aliens,\" Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement",
      "Alligator Alcatraz jurisdiction clarifications",
      "The civil rights attorneys wanted Ruiz to identify an immigration court that has jurisdiction over the detention center so that petitions can be filed for the detainees' bond or release. The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don't have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades.",
      "At the start of Monday's hearing, government attorneys said they would designate the immigration court at the Krome North Service Processing Center in the Miami area as having jurisdiction over the detention center in the Everglades in an effort to address some of the civil rights attorneys' constitutional concerns. The judge told the government attorneys that he didn't expect them to change that designation without good reason.",
      "But before delving into the core issues of the detainees' rights, Ruiz wanted to hear about whether the lawsuit was filed in the proper jurisdiction in Miami. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district.",
      "The hearing ended without the judge making an immediate ruling. Ruiz suggested that the case against the federal defendants might be appropriate for the southern district because a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Miami is responsible for oversight of the detention center under an agreement between the state and federal governments.",
      "But Ruiz also questioned whether the case against the state defendants might be better in the middle district, because all of the purported civil rights violations occurred at the facility itself, which is located in Collier County, several miles outside the southern district.",
      "All parties have agreed that if the complaints against the state are moved to another venue, then the complaints against the federal government should be moved as well.",
      "Second lawsuit seeks halt of operations at Alligator Alcatraz",
      "The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren't followed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Aug. 7 ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing that wrapped up last week. She has said she plans to issue a ruling before the order expires later this week.",
      "State says claims in lawsuit are false",
      "The state of Florida has disputed claims that Alligator Alcatraz detainees have been unable to meet with their attorneys. The state's lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28. The first detainees arrived at the beginning of July.",
      "But the civil rights attorneys said that even if lawyers have been scheduled to meet with their clients at the detention center, it hasn't been in private or confidential, and it is more restrictive than at other immigration detention facilities. They said scheduling delays and an unreasonable advanced notice requirement have hindered their ability to meet with the detainees, thereby violating their constitutional rights.",
      "Civil rights attorneys said officers are going cell-to-cell to pressure detainees into signing voluntary removal orders before they're allowed to consult their attorneys, and some detainees have been deported even though they didn't have final removal orders. Along with the spread of a respiratory infection and rainwater flooding their tents, the circumstances have fueled a feeling of desperation among detainees, the attorneys wrote in a court filing.",

      "Twenty states and the District of Columbia sued the Justice Department on Monday for adding a new immigration enforcement rule to federal grants that assist victims of crime \u2014 arguing it's part of the Trump administration's crackdown against \"sanctuary states.\"",
      "The lawsuit focuses on the Office for Victims of Crime, a 42-year-old division of the Justice Department that hands out more than $1 billion per year to all 50 states to compensate crime victims and fund programs like local crisis counseling centers, emergency shelters, domestic abuse hotlines and victim advocacy services.",
      "The Trump-era Justice Department added a new condition to those grants that denies funding to any program that \"violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law.\" That includes failing to \"give access to [Department of Homeland Security] agents, or honor DHS requests.\"",
      "But the states that joined Monday's lawsuit argue that the rule is illegal, since the Reagan-era law that set up the federal government's crime victim grant programs doesn't say anything about immigration enforcement.",
      "\"The challenged conditions would force these States into an untenable position: either forfeit access to critical resources for vulnerable crime victims and their families, or accept unlawful conditions, allowing the federal government to conscript state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law,\" the states and D.C. argue in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Rhode Island.",
      "Mostly Democratic states joined the suit, including California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Colorado. Collectively, they've received more than $500 million a year in crime victim grants since 2021, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The states asked a federal judge to block the new rules and declare them illegal. They said they need \"urgent relief\" since applications for most of the grants are due Wednesday.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "As President Trump seeks to dramatically ramp up arrests of suspected undocumented immigrants, his administration has taken aim at so-called sanctuary cities and states, which generally limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents.",
      "Within hours of his swearing-in on Jan. 20, the president signed an executive order directing officials to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Justice Department to identify and pause grants to groups that \"support or provide services to removable or illegal aliens.\"",
      "The administration argues that sanctuary cities and states make it harder to enforce immigration laws, especially against criminals who end up in state or local custody.",
      "Supporters of sanctuary laws, however, argue that forcing local law enforcement officers to work with immigration agents makes migrants less likely to cooperate with the police. Monday's lawsuit said the conditions on crime victim grants risk \"destroying trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to preventing and responding to crime.\"",
      "\"The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.",
      "Earlier this year, the Justice Department cut off hundreds of federal grant programs, including money for nonprofits that help victims of hate crimes, sex trafficking and violence against children, according to a list obtained by CBS News. The heads of some nonprofits warned they would need to lay off staff or shutter crime victim hotlines.",
      "At the time, a Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News: \"We are confident that these cuts are consistent with the administration's priorities while at the same time protecting services that tangibly impact victims.\"",
      "A group of anti-domestic-violence nonprofits also sued the Justice Department earlier this year for banning grant funding under the Violence Against Women Act to groups that promote \"gender ideology\" or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. A judge paused that rule.",

      "President Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.",
      "\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"",
      "Why does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?",
      "\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.",
      "But soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"",
      "\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.",
      "After that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"",
      "In 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.",
      "The White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"",
      "\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.",
      "Trump's impending executive order to stop mail voting \u2014 would it be legal?",
      "In a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "He claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"",
      "But Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.",
      "Trump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"",
      "In fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany\u00a0and Denmark are among them.",
      "Mail-in voting in the U.S.",
      "In the U.S., mail voting is widespread:\u00a036 states offer some form of no-excuse mail-in voting \u2014 including 8 states that conduct elections entirely by mail \u2014 while the rest require a documented reason such as illness or military service, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
      "The topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.",
      "David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"",
      "\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News in a statement Monday night that \"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York.\"",
      "\"Democrats have eroded faith in our elections with reckless laws, such as unfettered mail-in voting, illegally changing laws to benefit their voters, and slow-walking the counting of votes far past Election Day,\" Fields said.",

      "Oklahoma will require applicants for teacher jobs coming from California and New York to pass an exam that the Republican-dominated state's top education official says is designed to safeguard against \"radical leftist ideology\" but that opponents decry as a \"MAGA loyalty test.\"",
      "Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's public schools superintendent, said Monday that any teacher coming from the two blue states will be required to pass an assessment exam administered by PragerU, an Oklahoma-based conservative nonprofit, before getting a state certification.",
      "\"As long as I am superintendent, Oklahoma classrooms will be safeguarded from the radical leftist ideology fostered in places like California and New York,\" Walters said in a statement.",
      "PragerU, short for Prager University, puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics. It promotes itself as \"focused on changing minds through the creative use of digital media.\"",
      "Quinton Hitchcock, a spokesperson for the state's education department, said the Prager test for teacher applicants has been finalized and will be rolling out \"very soon.\"",
      "The state didn't release the entire 50-question test to The Associated Press but did provide the first five questions, which include asking what the first three words of the U.S. Constitution are and why freedom of religion is \"important to America's identity.\"",
      "Prager didn't immediately respond to a phone message or email seeking comment. But Marissa Streit, CEO of PragerU, told CNN several questions on the assessment relate to \"undoing the damage of gender ideology.\"",
      "Jonathan Zimmerman, who teaches history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, said Oklahoma's contract with PragerU to test out-of-state would-be teachers \"is a watershed moment.\"",
      "\"Instead of Prager simply being a resource that you can draw in an optional way, Prager has become institutionalized as part of the state system,\" he said. \"There's no other way to describe it.\"",
      "Zimmerman said the American Historical Association did a survey last year of 7th- to 12th-grade teachers and found that only a minority were relying on textbooks for day-to-day instruction. He said the upside to that is that most history books are \"deadly boring.\" But he said that means history teachers are relying on online resources, such as those from Prager.",
      "\"I think what we're now seeing in Oklahoma is something different, which is actually empowering Prager as a kind of gatekeeper for future teachers,\" Zimmerman said.",
      "Oklahoma's move sharply criticized",
      "One of the nation's largest teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers, has often been at odds with the Trump administration and the crackdown on teacher autonomy in the classroom.",
      "\"This MAGA loyalty test will be yet another turnoff for teachers in a state already struggling with a huge shortage,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten.",
      "She was critical of Walters, who pushed for the state's curriculum standards to be revised to include conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"His priority should be educating students, but instead, it's getting Donald Trump and other MAGA politicians to notice him,\" Weingarten said in a statement.",
      "Tina Ellsworth, president of the nonprofit National Council for the Social Studies, also raised concerns that the test would prevent teachers from applying for jobs.",
      "\"State boards of education should stay true to the values and principles of the U.S. Constitution,\" Ellsworth said. \"Imposing an ideology test to become a teacher in our great democracy is antithetical to those principles.\"",
      "State Rep. John Waldron, the Oklahoma Democratic Party chairman, decried the test as \"political posturing.\"",
      "\"If you want to see a textbook definition of indoctrination, how about a loyalty test for teachers,\" said Waldron. \"It's a sad echo of a more paranoid past.\"",
      "Waldron, a New Jersey native, said he would have been in the target demographic for this kind of test when he moved from Washington, D.C., to Oklahoma to teach social studies in 1999. He said it would have struck him as an indication that the state \"wasn't serious about attracting quality teachers.\"",
      "\"Teachers are not rushing here from other states to teach. We've got an enormous teacher shortage and it's not like we have a giant supply of teachers coming in from blue states anyway,\" he said.",

      "Most of the House Democratic Caucus left the state earlier this month, denying the Republican majority the required attendance to conduct business. House rules require 100 members to be present; Republicans hold 88 seats.",
      "The Democratic quorum break was triggered by a Republican push to redraw the state's U.S. House district maps that would net the GOP up to five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Last week, the absent lawmakers had signaled they were ready to return to Austin after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ended a first special session and Democrats in California moved forward with a plan to respond.",
      "\"Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, the Democratic leader, said in a statement issued Monday morning.",
      "As the House returned to business, the redistricting proposal and dozens of other bills were referred to their respective committees. The redistricting committee met Monday night and passed the maps along party lines. The Senate's redistricting committee passed the proposed maps along party lines on Sunday evening.",

      "Impact on midterm elections",
      "On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total House seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.",
      "Texas' maps would aim to give the GOP five more winnable seats.",
      "California Democrats, who hold supermajorities in both chambers \u2014 enough to act without any Republican votes \u2014 on Friday unveiled a proposal that could give Democrats there an additional five U.S. House seats. But any changes would first need the approval of state lawmakers and voters. Democratic California Gov.

    "story": [
      "The conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming a voting equipment company by spreading lies about President Trump's 2020 election loss, according to documents filed Monday. The suit against Newsmax was brought by Dominion Voting Systems, which alleged the network published false and defamatory statements claiming the company rigged the election. A Delaware judge ruled partially in favor of Dominion in a decision earlier this year, additional court filings show.",
      "The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million\u00a0to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network.",
      "Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax did indeed defame Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis left it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. Newsmax and Dominion reached a settlement before the trial could take place.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Monday, a Dominion spokesperson said the company was \"pleased to have settled this matter.\"",
      "The settlement originally came to light in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Newsmax, which was dated Friday, Aug. 15, the day that a deal was reached, according to the document. Newsmax has agreed to pay the settlement in three installments of $27 million, $20 million and $20 million, with the final installment to be paid in January 2027, the filing said.",
      "Newsmax continues to deny allegations that suggest its coverage of Dominion in the context of the 2020 election was defamatory.",
      "\"Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,\" the company said in a statement published on its website. \"We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\"",
      "The disclosure of the settlement came as Mr. Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to former President Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines, such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. It was unclear how the Republican president could achieve that.",
      "\"I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we're at it, Highly 'Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,\" Mr. Trump wrote in the post.",
      "The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Mr. Trump's allies about his 2020 loss, despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. At the time, Davis found it was \"CRYSTAL clear\" that none of the allegations was true.",
      "Internal correspondence from Newsmax officials likewise shows they knew the claims were baseless.",
      "\"How long are we going to play along with election fraud?\" Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case.",
      "Newsmax took pride that it was not calling the election for Biden, and internal documents show it saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed Mr. Trump won. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion's earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network's business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Mr. Trump's 2020 election claims.",
      "At Newsmax, employees repeatedly warned against false allegations from pro-Trump guests such as attorney Sidney Powell, according to documents in the lawsuit. In one text, even Newsmax owner Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally, said he found it \"scary\" that Mr. Trump was meeting with Powell.",
      "Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. The network retracted some of the more bombastic allegations in December 2020.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there's no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president's biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. Mr. Trump's then-attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.",
      "Mr. Trump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits alleging fraud, some before Trump-appointed judges. Numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results, including some run by Republicans, turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error and affirmed Biden's win.",
      "After returning to office, Mr. Trump pardoned those who tried to halt the transfer of power during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and directed his Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a former Trump cybersecurity appointee who had vouched for the security and accuracy of the 2020 election.",
      "As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Mr. Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms that Mr. Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey's work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.",

      "Barr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "Last month, after the FBI made that video public, an\u00a0analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed \u2014 including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.",
      "Now, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.",
      "Sources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.",
      "The deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.",
      "Epstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.",
      "Scrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Campaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.",
      "The release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.",
      "As Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled\u00a0to be deposed by the committee.",
      "Barr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "As attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)",
      "Here is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.",
      "Questions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation",
      "Did the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?",
      "Before the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.",
      "That was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.",
      "Does Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?",
      "Barr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.",
      "Just before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.",
      "What did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?",
      "No evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.",
      "A private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown announced a bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate on Monday, nearly a year after his reelection effort in 2024 fell short.",
      "\"I didn't plan to run for office again. But when I see what's going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown said in a video announcement. \"That's why I'm running for Senate, because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect, and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.\"",
      "Brown, 72, lost his bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber last November against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno. Brown was the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and was one of the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election in which they took control of the Senate.",
      "Brown had historically appealed to ticket-splitters with his strong working-class brand in the state, which he had represented in the Senate since 2007. But President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points, making Brown's election a steep uphill climb. Moreno beat him by less than four points.",
      "In 2026, Brown is set to face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who was appointed to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated. The special election will determine who will serve the remainder of Vance's term, meaning the winner would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "Husted, 57, was appointed in January by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and previously served as DeWine's lieutenant governor.",
      "The Ohio race is expected to be a tough battle for Democrats, as the party seeks to retake the majority in the Senate. With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in a handful of potentially competitive states, while flipping four seats to retake a majority in 2026.",
      "While few races appear comfortably in range, Democrats have been working to recruit formidable candidates, like former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, to boost their chances. Brown's entrance into the race marks the latest recruiting victory for the party.",

      "For more than 40 years, Pelto, a glaciologist and a professor at Nichols College in Massachusetts, has returned to this remote wilderness. \"We got 6,000 measurements on this glacier,\" he said.",
      "Today, the crunch of footsteps in the snow is now rivaled by the sound of melting ice. \"It's always melting off,\" he said. \"The crevasses are changing. We can hear the water flowing under our feet.\"",
      "Pelto founded the North Cascade Glacier Climate Project as a grad student in 1984. He vowed to measure these glaciers every summer for 50 years. This is Year 42. In that time the glaciers have changed more than he has, shrinking by 40%. Some have disappeared.",
      "Pelto's work has been featured by NASA, and fed into a worldwide glacier database. Of the 47 glaciers he has studied, returning to them year after year, he says 12 are now gone, \"nine of them just in the last five years.\"",

The data points that she and her dad measure eventually will go into her art. \"Data is a story about something in the real world and that story has meaning and emotion,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm trying to bring into my art.\"",
      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" said Jill.",
      "Her art has given her dad a new way to share the story he's been recording for the past 42 years. And it's also changed their relationship: \"We do it so seamlessly at this point,\" Mauri said.",
      "\"Feels like you're one team out here?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied.",
      "Jill added, \"This bigger project just means so much to us and has shaped our lives. So, sharing that year after year is beyond special.\"",
      "And now, Mauri Pelto has just eight summers left to fulfill his 50-year promise. Asked what he thinks it will be like to no longer come out to the glaciers, Mauri replied, \"I don't know, I can't remember what it was like to not come out here. This landscape has been shaped by ice, and so to understand the landscape and the ice, you really have to walk across it.\"",

      "Ong not only teaches his students what AI is \u2014 but also where it falls short.",
      "\"If you keep at it and say, 'no, you're wrong. You're wrong' \u2014 eventually AI will say, 'I'm sorry, I was wrong.' Doing that with your class can show you that AI isn't really as smart as you think it is,\" Ong said.",

      "\"It can, I think, change the way teachers work in ways that empower teachers, gives them more information, makes it easier in terms of preparing for classes, thinking about how to put together lesson plans,\" Smith said.",
      "In a recent survey by Gallup and Walton Family Foundation, teachers reported saving an average of nearly six hours a week with the help of AI.",
      "Ong said if AI is already here, \"let's try to figure this out to help our kids continue to learn and grow.\"",

      "The SolarStratos plane made the landmark flight from Sion airport in southwest Switzerland on Tuesday, taking advantage of warm air thermals to go beyond the record that has stood for 15 years.",
      "The certified altitude record for a solar plane stands at 9,235 meters, or 30,298 feet.",
      "The achievement is \"one of those unforgettable peaks that define great human and technological adventures,\" the SolarStratos mission said in a statement.",
      "At cruising altitude, Domjan actually crossed paths with a commercial airliner, SolarStratos said, calling the moment \"a powerful symbol of what the decarbonized aviation of tomorrow might look like.\"",

      "Domjan \u2014 whose company bio describes him as a \"eco-adventurer\" and lecturer who pilots planes, gliders and helicopters \u2014 is aiming to be the first to take a solar-powered plane above 10,000 meters, flying at the same altitude as airliners.

SolarStratos is 9.6 meters long, and its huge wingspan of 24.8 meters accommodates the 22 square meters of high-spec solar panels topping the wings, and allows for flying at low speeds.",
      "The plane, which SolarStartos calls \"daring and finely engineered,\"\u00a0can take off at low speeds, from 50 kilometers per hour upwards. Its maximum speed is 140 kph, while its cruising speed is around 80 kph.",
      "\"Tomorrow can be better than what we have today\"",
      "In 2012, the pioneering Domjan became the first person to sail around the world in a fully solar-powered boat, a journey that began in Miami in 2010.",

      "A first attempt on Friday was quickly abandoned when the forecast thermals failed to materialize, saving the batteries for Sunday when the plane got to 8,224 meters.",
      "During the first phase of record attempts, the aircraft has to make maximum use of rising warm air currents to climb to around 4,000-5,000 meters. It then has to recharge its batteries at this altitude before climbing again.",

    "summary": "Last week, more than three years after being suspended from coaching, the FBI arrested Sean Gardner, 38, on a federal child pornography charge.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. gymnastics world was only just recovering from a devastating sexual abuse scandal when a promising young coach moved from Mississippi to Iowa to take a job in 2018 at an elite academy known for training Olympic champions.",
      "Liang \"Chow\" Qiao, the owner of Chow's Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, thought highly enough of his new hire, Sean Gardner, to put him in charge of the club's premier junior event and to coach some of its most promising girls.",
      "But four years later, Gardner was gone from Chow's with little notice.",
      "USA Gymnastics, the organization rocked by the Larry Nassar sex-abuse crisis that led to the creation of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, had been informed by the watchdog group that Gardner was suspended from all contact with gymnasts.",
      "The reason for Gardner's removal wasn't disclosed. But court records obtained exclusively by The Associated Press show the coach was accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at Chow's and secretly recording others undressing in a gym bathroom at his prior job in Mississippi.",
      "Last week, more than three years after being suspended from coaching, the FBI arrested Gardner, 38, on a federal child pornography charge. But his disciplinary case has still not been resolved by SafeSport, which handles sex-abuse cases in Olympic sports.",
      "In cases like Gardner's, the public can be in the dark for years while SafeSport investigates and sanctions coaches. SafeSport requires that allegations be reported to police to ensure abusers don't run unchecked outside of sports, but critics say the system is a slow, murky process.",
      "\"From an outward operational view, it seems that if SafeSport is involved in any way, the situation turns glow-in-the-dark toxic,\" said attorney Steve Silvey, a longtime SafeSport critic who has represented people in cases involving the center.",
      "While acknowledging there can be delays as its investigations unfold, SafeSport defended its temporary suspensions in a statement as \"a unique and valuable intervention\" when there are concerns of a risk to others.",
      "Nevertheless, in 2024, Gardner was able to land a job helping care for surgical patients at an Iowa hospital, two years after the abuse allegations against him were reported to SafeSport and the police.",
      "And it was not until late May that West Des Moines police executed a search warrant at his home, eventually leading to the recovery of a trove of photos and videos on his computer and cellphone of nude young girls, court records show.",
      "Authorities in Iowa sealed the court documents after the AP asked about the investigation earlier this month, before details of the federal charge were made public Friday. Gardner, Qiao and Gardner's former employer in Mississippi did not respond to AP requests for comment.",
      "\"The job that I've always wanted\"",
      "Chow's Gymnastics is best known as the academy where U.S. gymnasts Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas trained before becoming gold medalists at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.",
      "Qiao opened the gym in 1998 after starring on the Chinese national team and moving to the United States to coach at the University of Iowa. The gym became a draw for top youth gymnasts, with some families moving to Iowa to train there.",
      "Gardner moved to Iowa in September 2018, jumping at the opportunity to coach under Qiao.",
      "\"This is the job that I've always wanted. Chow is really someone I have looked up to since I've been coaching,\" Gardner told the ABC affiliate WOI-TV in 2019. \"And you can tell when you step foot in the gym, just even from coaching the girls, the culture that he's built. It's amazing. It's beautiful.\"",
      "A year later, Gardner was promoted to director of Chow's Winter Classic, an annual meet that draws more than 1,000 gymnasts to Iowa. He also coached a junior Olympics team during his four-year tenure at Chow's.",
      "Several of his students earned college gymnastics scholarships, but Gardner said he had bigger goals.",
      "\"You want to leave a thumbprint on their life, so when they go off hopefully to school, to bigger and better things, that they remember Chow's as family,\" he said in a 2020 interview with WOI-TV.",
      "Coach accused of sexual misconduct in Iowa, Mississippi",
      "Gardner is accused of abusing his position at Chow's and his former job at Jump'In Gymnastics in Mississippi to prey on girls under his tutelage, according to a nine-page FBI affidavit released Friday that summarizes the allegations against him.",
      "A girl reported to SafeSport in March 2022 that Gardner used \"inappropriate spotting techniques\" in which he would put his hands between her legs and touch her vagina, the affidavit said.",
      "It said she alleged Gardner would ask girls if they were sexually active and call them \"idiots, sluts, and whores.\" She said this behavior began after his hiring in 2018 and continued until she left the gym in 2020 and provided the names of six other potential victims.",
      "SafeSport suspended Gardner in July 2022 \u2014 four months after the girl's report \u2014 a provisional step it can take in severe cases with \"sufficient evidentiary support\" as investigations proceed.",
      "A month after that, the center received a report from another girl alleging additional \"sexual contact and physical abuse,\" including that Gardner similarly fondled her during workouts, the FBI affidavit said. The girl said that he once dragged her across the carpet so hard that it burned her buttocks, the affidavit said.",
      "SafeSport shared the reports with West Des Moines police, in line with its policy requiring adults who interact with youth athletes to disclose potential criminal cases to law enforcement.",
      "While SafeSport's suspension took Gardner out of gymnastics, the criminal investigation quickly hit a roadblock.",
      "Police records show a detective told SafeSport to urge the alleged victims to file criminal complaints, but only one of their mothers contacted police in 2022. That woman said her daughter did not want to pursue criminal charges, and police suspended the investigation.",
      "Victims of abuse are often reluctant to cooperate with police, said Ken Lang, a retired detective and associate professor of criminal justice at Milligan University.",
      "\"In this case you have the prestige of this facility,\" he said. \"Do they want to associate their name with that, in that way, when their aspirations were to succeed in gymnastics?\"",
      "Police suspended the investigation, even as Gardner was on probation for his second-offense of driving while intoxicated.",
      "A dormant case reopened, and a year later, an arrest",
      "The case stayed dormant until April 2024 when another former Chow's student came forward to the West Des Moines Police Department to report abuse allegations, according to a now-sealed affidavit signed by police detective Jeff Lyon. The AP is not identifying the student in line with its policy of not naming victims of alleged sexual abuse.",
      "The now 18-year-old told police she began taking lessons from Gardner when she was 11 or 12 in 2019, initially seeing him as a \"father figure\" who tried to help her get through her parents' divorce. He told her she could tell him \"anything,\" the affidavit said.",
      "When she moved in 2021, she told police, he gave her a hug and said she could text and follow him on Instagram and other social media sites, where he went by the nickname \"Coach Seanie,\" because gym policy barring such contact no longer applied.",
      "According to a summary of her statement provided in Lyon's affidavit, she said Gardner fondled her during exercises, repeatedly touching her vagina; rubbed her back and butt and discussed his sex life; and made her do inappropriate stretches that exposed her privates.",
      "She told police she suspected he used his cellphone to film her in that position.",
      "Reached by the AP, the teen's mother declined comment. The mother told police she was interested in a monetary settlement with Chow's because the gym \"had been made aware of the complaints and they did nothing to stop them,\" according to Lyon's affidavit. The gym didn't return AP messages seeking comment.",
      "It took 16 months after the teen's 2024 report for the FBI to arrest Gardner, who made an initial court appearance in Des Moines on Friday on a charge of producing visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, which can carry up to 30 years in prison. A public defender assigned to represent him didn't return AP messages seeking comment.",
      "It's unclear why the case took so long to investigate and also when the FBI, which had to pay $138 million to Nassar's victims for botching that investigation, got involved in the case.",
      "Among evidence seized by investigators in late May were a cellphone, laptop and a desktop computer along with handwritten notes between Gardner and his former pupils, according to the sealed court documents.",
      "They found images of girls, approximately 6 to 14 years in age, who were nude, using the toilet or changing into leotards, those documents show. Those images appear to have come from a hidden camera in a restroom.",
      "They also uncovered 50 video files and 400 photos, including some that appeared to be child pornography, according to the FBI affidavit. One video allegedly shows Gardner entering the bathroom and turning off the camera.",
      "Investigators also found images of an adult woman secretly filmed entering and exiting a bathtub, and identified her as Gardner's ex-girlfriend. That woman as well as the gym's owner, Candi Workman, told investigators the images appeared to come from Jump'In Gymnastics' facility in Purvis, Mississippi, which has since been closed.",
      "SafeSport's power has limits",
      "SafeSport has long touted that it can deliver sanctions in cases where criminal charges are not pursued as key to its mission. However, Gardner's ability to land a job in health care illustrates the limits of that power: It can ban people from sports but that sanction is not guaranteed to reach the general public.",
      "While not commenting about Gardner's case directly, it said in a statement provided to AP that a number of issues factor into why cases can take so long to close, including the 8,000 reports it receives a year with only around 30 full-time investigators. It has revamped some procedures, it said, \u00a0in an attempt to become more efficient.",
      "\"While the Center is able and often does cooperate in law enforcement investigations,\" it said, \"law enforcement is not required to share information, updates, or even confirm an investigation is ongoing.\"",
      "USA Gymnastics President Li Li Leung called the center's task \"really tough, difficult to navigate.\"",
      "\"I would like to see more consistency with their outcomes and sanctions,\" Leung said. \"I would like to see more standardization on things. I would like to see more communication, more transparency from their side.\"",
      "A case that lingers, even after the SafeSport ban",
      "As the investigation proceeded, Gardner said on his Facebook page he had landed a new job in May 2024 as a surgical technologist at MercyOne West Des Moines Medical Center. It's a role that calls for positioning patients on the operating room table, and assisting with procedures and post-surgery care.",
      "Asked about Gardner's employment, hospital spokesman Todd Mizener told the AP: \"The only information I can provide is that he is no longer\" at the hospital.",
      "Meanwhile, the case lingers, leaving lives in limbo more than three years after the SafeSport Center and police first learned of it.",
      "\"SafeSport is now part of a larger problem rather than a solution, if it was ever a solution,\" said attorney Silvey. \"The most fundamental professional task such as coordination with local or federal law enforcement gets botched on a daily basis, hundreds of times a year now.\"",

      "At least five Republican-led states have moved to deploy members of their National Guard forces to the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington, D.C., through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.",
      "The governors of Mississippi and Louisiana\u00a0on Monday announced they would be sending 200 and 135 Guard troops, respectively. On Saturday, West Virginia said it was deploying between 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio said it would send 150 in the coming days.",
      "Tennessee has also provided 160 Guard troops, according to The Associated Press. The Tennessee National Guard has been deployed \"to assist with monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities, and traffic control,\" a spokesperson for Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee told AP.",
      "The move comes as federal agents and National Guard troops have begun to appear across the heavily Democratic city after President Trump's executive order last week, federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 D.C. National Guard troops.",
      "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 Guard troops to Washington, while South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the Defense Department.",
      "\"West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital,\" Morrisey said.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry wrote Monday on social media: \"I am proud to support this mission to return safety and sanity to Washington DC and cities all across our country, including right here in Louisiana.\"",
      "Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves wrote on X that \"crime is out of control\" in Washington, D.C., adding: \"I know the brave men and women of our National Guard will do an excellent job enhancing public safety and supporting law enforcement.\"",

James Seward, West Virginia's adjutant general, said in a statement that members of the state's National Guard \"stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region,\" and that the troops' \"unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking.\"",
      "Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican from Vermont, declined on Friday to send the state's National Guard troops to the nation's capital. Scott's chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, told Vermont Public that while public safety is a \"legitimate concern\" in cities across the country, \"the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as proper use of the National Guard.\"",
      "The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.",
      "By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.",
      "A White House official\u00a0told CBS News on Saturday that National Guard members deployed to D.C. \"may be armed,\" but that they would not make arrests. This was a reversal from earlier in the week, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.",
      "\"The National Guard is not making arrests at this time \u2013 they may be armed, consistent with their mission and training, to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence,\" the White House official said Saturday.",
      "A protest against Mr. Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday afternoon before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said \"No fascist takeover of D.C.,\" and some in the crowd held signs that said \"No military occupation.\" Mr. Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",
      "Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country.",

      "On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an \"emergency police commissioner\" after the district's top lawyer sued to contest. After Friday's court hearing, Attorney General Pam Bond issued a memo that directed the Metropolitan Police Department to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.",
      "District officials say they are evaluating how to best comply.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin threatened the East Coast with dangerous rip currents as the large storm moved on a projected path up the Atlantic Ocean, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Tuesday. The hurricane\u00a0isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but people in North Carolina's Outer Banks were warned of possible coastal flooding that triggered evacuation orders.",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was downgraded to a Category 2 storm Tuesday morning as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. It previously\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to a Category 3 early Sunday morning, then regaining strength again later in the day.",
      "As of 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph and was moving north-northwest at 10 mph. The storm's center was about 615 miles southwest of Bermuda and about the same distance south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.",
      "A\u00a0Category 2 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 96 mph to 110 mph. Erin was just under what's considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Forecasters said fluctuations in Erin's intensity were possible over the next few days.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "The center of the storm was expected to pass to the east of the Bahamas on Tuesday night and move between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast Wednesday and Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin is already a large storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 80 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the string of barrier islands along the North Carolina coast known as the Outer Banks, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch was issued north of the Outer Banks to Virginia's Atlantic coast, and for Bermuda. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge warning was also issued for the Outer Banks, meaning there was a danger of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding that was expected to start Wednesday.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "When is Hurricane Erin expected to impact the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly, but the initial effects of the storm were expected to be seen as early as Tuesday afternoon's high tide cycle along the North Carolina coast, according to the National Weather Service office for Newport/Morehead City.",
      "The worst conditions were expected late Wednesday through Thursday, when the center of Erin was expected to be at its closest point to the coast, according to the weather service. At that time, forecasters\u00a0warn, severe flooding could reach buildings and roads along the Outer Banks. Many roadways will likely be under several feet of water and inaccessible for several days due to the flooding.",
      "Mandatory evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the expected flooding.",
      "Coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard will feel the effects of Erin with dangerous rip currents and high waves of 10 to over 20 feet over the next several days.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches ranging from South Florida up to New England are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches on Tuesday,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, have already prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",

      "Although the season's first Atlantic hurricane is expected to stay offshore, evacuations were ordered on barrier islands along the Carolina coast as authorities warned the storm could churn up dangerous rip currents from Florida through\u00a0the Mid-Atlantic to the New England coast. Tropical storm and surge watches were issued for much of the Outer Banks. Coastal flooding was expected to begin Tuesday and continue through Thursday.",
      "The evacuations on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke came at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that jut into the Atlantic Ocean and are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian caused record amounts of damage in Ocracoke. Last year, Hurricane Ernesto stayed offshore but created high surf and swells.",
      "Tommy Hutcherson, who owns the community's only grocery store, said the island has mostly bounced back. He's optimistic this storm won't be as destructive.",
      "\"But you just never know. I felt the same way about Dorian and we really got smacked,\" he said.",

      "Kayle Bates, 67, was pronounced dead at 6:17 p.m. following a three-drug injection at Florida State Prison near Starke under a death warrant signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. It was the 10th death sentence carried out by the state of Florida in 2025, extending the state record for executions in a single year. Two more executions are planned within the next month.",
      "Alex Lanfranconi, a spokesman for DeSantis, said Bates said \"no\" when asked if he had any final words just before the drugs began flowing.",
      "Florida's executions are carried out using a three-drug lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",
      "The Department of Corrections said Bates awoke at 5:15 a.m. Tuesday and had three visitors, his daughter, his sister and his brother-in-law. He declined a last meal and did not meet with a spiritual adviser, department spokesman Ted Veerman said.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second place with four each. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee have carried out one each, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks executions nationwide.",

Bates abducted White from the insurance office where she worked, took her into some woods behind the building, attempted to rape her, stabbed her to death and tore a diamond ring from one of her fingers, according to court documents.",
      "Attorneys for Bates filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as a federal lawsuit claiming DeSantis' process for signing death warrants was discriminatory. The lawsuit was recently dismissed by a judge who found problems with the lawsuit's statistical analysis.",
      "The Florida Supreme Court recently denied Bates' pending claims, including arguments that evidence of organic brain damage had been inadequately considered during his second penalty phase. The court ruled Bates has had three decades to raise these claims. And on Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Bates' last appeals to block the execution.",

      "Joslin referred to their ranger position as a \"dream job.\" They were fired by a park official for \"failing to demonstrate acceptable conduct\" in their role as a Yosemite wildlife biologist, according to the social media post, which accuses the National Park Service of violating their constitutional rights to free expression.",
      "\"Preservation has been my life's work\u2014of Yosemite, the wildlife, the land, recreation, of peoples rights and safety, of community and acceptance, and now the Constitutional First Amendment,\" Joslin wrote, adding, \"I want my rights and I want my career back.\"",
      "The National Park Service said in a statement that its leadership, along with authorities at the U.S. Department of Justice, \"are pursuing administrative action against several Yosemite National Park employees and possible criminal charges against several park visitors who are alleged to have violated federal laws and regulations related to demonstrations.\"",
      "The statement did not specify what laws and regulations were violated. It said the park service could not share details about \"the specifics of personnel actions or criminal investigations\" related to the matter.",
      "The flag that Joslin helped mount flew briefly from a spot near the summit of El Capitan, which towers over Yosemite Valley and is the park's most recognizable landmark, on May 20.",
      "The next day the park's acting superintendent signed an updated compendium, dated May 20, which includes regulations banning large banners, flags or signs displayed in the wilderness without a permit. Also included in the compendium are rules governing demonstrations within the park, which similarly require permits unless they involve fewer than 25 people and take place in one of the park's designated \"free speech locations.\"",
      "A previous version of the compendium, dated May 22, 2024, which was linked to the Yosemite website as recently as May 1, 2025, did not include a regulation about banners and flags.",
      "Flags and banners have been hung from Yosemite's El Capitan in the past, including an upside-down American flag in February in response to the Trump administration's firings of federal workers and a banner in protest of the war in Gaza last June. The upside-down American flag also was hung by workers at the national park.",
      "The people involved in stringing up the trans pride flag in May\u00a0described it as \"an epic reminder that queer people belong everywhere\u2014on big walls, on the trails, and serving and protecting our public lands.\" It appeared on the rock formation in the weeks leading up to Pride Month, and as critics of the Trump administration saw policy decisions continue to target transgender Americans.",

      "\"No matter the cause, displaying signs, banners, and flags outside of designated First-Amendment areas detracts from the visitor experience and the protection of the park,\" the statement said. \"To safeguard the protection of visitors, visitor experiences, and park resources, most demonstrations require a permit.\"",

      "Ethan Foltz, 22, allegedly developed the \"Rapper Bot\" botnet, a network of devices such as digital video recorders and WiFi routers that have been infected with malware and used to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks \u2014 a type of cyberattack aimed at slowing or shutting down websites, servers or other devices by sending large amounts of requests and overloading the system \u2014 since at least 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of Alaska said. Prosecutors said the network is \"one of the most sophisticated and powerful DDoS-for-hire Botnets currently in existence.\"",
      "Prosecutors said law enforcement officials stopped the attacks on Aug. 6 after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home in Eugene, Oregon, and obtaining administrative control of his botnet.",
      "Court documents allege Foltz loaned \"Rapper Bot\" to paying customers who targeted victims in more than 80 countries, including a U.S. government network, a social media platform and U.S. tech companies. The Department of Justice did not disclose the specific victims.",
      "\"Rapper Bot\" was allegedly controlling approximately 65,000 to 95,000 infected devices and using them to send a massive amount of data, about 2 to 3 terabits per second, in order to overwhelm the target's bandwidth, according to prosecutors. At least five infected victim devices were believed to be in Alaska, investigators said.",
      "Foltz is charged with one count of aiding and abetting computer intrusions, prosecutors said. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. It wasn't immediately clear if Foltz has legal representation.",
      "Special Agent in Charge Kenneth DeChellis of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General said the charge against Foltz highlights efforts to \"disrupt and dismantle emerging cyber threats targeting the Department of Defense and the defense industrial base.\"",
      "The case is part of Operation PowerOFF, an ongoing international law enforcement effort aimed at dismantling criminal DDoS-for-hire infrastructures worldwide, authorities said.",
      "In December 2024, federal authorities seized 27 internet domains associated with DDoS-for-hire services and charged two people who allegedly oversaw the services.",

      "The frozen shrimp were imported from Indonesian company PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati and sold at Walmart stores as Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, the FDA said on Tuesday. The agency noted it has recommended that Walmart recall the product.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have issued a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores. We are working with the supplier to investigate,\" Walmart said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The company added that consumers who bought the shrimp shouldn't eat it and should throw it out. Customers can contact the store where they purchased the product for a full refund, it added.",
      "The shrimp could be contaminated with a radioactive isotope called Cesium-137, although the FDA said that no products as of yet have tested positive for it. The agency said it issued the warning about Walmart's Great Value shrimp after it had detected Cesium-137 in a single shipment of frozen shrimp from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati.",
      "That shipment \"did not enter U.S. commerce,\" the FDA said.",
      "Here's what to know about the warning.",

      "\"Distributors and retailers should dispose of this product and should not sell or serve this product,\" the FDA added.",
      "What is Cesium-137?",
      "Cesium-137, or Cs-137, is the radioactive form of the element cesium, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Produced by nuclear fission, it's used in medical devices and is also a byproduct of nuclear fission in nuclear reactors and weapons testing, the EPA notes.",
      "How dangerous is the potential Cesium-137 contamination?",
      "The Cesium-137 detected in the imported shrimp was about 68 Bq/kg, which the FDA said sits below its threshold of 1200 Bq/kg for \"levels of concern\" for imported foods.",
      "\"At this level, the product would not pose an acute hazard to consumers,\" the FDA said in its warning notice.",
      "However, the FDA noted that repeated low-dose exposure to Cesium-137 carries an \"elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.\"",
      "It added, \"Avoiding products like the shipment FDA tested with similar levels of Cs-137 is a measure intended to reduce exposure to low-level radiation that could have health impacts with continued exposure over a long period of time.\"",

    "story": [
      "Internal government documents obtained by CBS News show the Trump administration has expanded its campaign to persuade countries around the world to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.",
      "The documents indicate Uganda in East Africa recently agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who hail from other countries on the continent, as long as they don't have criminal histories. It's unclear how many deportees Uganda would ultimately accept under the arrangement with the U.S. government.",
      "Honduras' government has also agreed to receive deportees from other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, including families traveling with children, the documents show. The government of Honduras agreed to a relatively small number of deportations \u2014 just several hundred over two years \u2014 but the documents indicate it could decide to accept more.",
      "Both agreements are based on a \"safe third country\" provision of U.S. immigration law that allows officials to reroute asylum-seekers to countries that are not their own if the U.S. government makes a determination that those nations can fairly hear their claims for humanitarian protection.",
      "The two bilateral deals outlined in the internal documents are part of a large-scale diplomatic effort that President Trump's administration has staged to strike deportation arrangements with nations across several continents, including those with problematic human rights records. The administration has argued those agreements are key to its mass deportation campaign, since there are some migrants who can't easily be deported to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.",
      "At least a dozen countries have already accepted or agreed to accept deportees from other nations since the second Trump administration took office, and U.S. officials have been aggressively courting other governments. Internal government documents show the Trump administration has also asked countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive these so-called third country deportees from the U.S.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "A senior State Department official said, \"We don't comment on the content of private diplomatic negotiations, but the State Department is doing everything possible to support the President's policy of keeping Americans safe by removing illegal aliens who have no right to be in the United States.\"",
      "Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to deport migrants to third countries with a minimal degree of notice and due process. The decision paved the way for the administration to continue expanding a practice it has relied on since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "In February, the Trump administration convinced Costa Rica and Panama to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Then, in March, the U.S. flew more than 200 Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they were held incommunicado for months at a notorious prison until they were returned to Venezuela last month under a prisoner swap.",
      "The administration has also sent immigrants convicted of violent crimes and who hail from Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Yemen and other countries to violence-torn South Sudan and the tiny southern African kingdom of Eswatini. Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.",
      "Last week, the State Department said the U.S. had signed a \"safe third country\" asylum agreement with Paraguay. Mexico, under an arrangement that predates Mr. Trump's second term, accepts the return of some Latin American migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "Human rights advocates have strongly denounced the Trump administration effort, saying migrants could be deported to countries where they could be harmed or returned to the place they fled. Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.",
      "In a report released last week, the State Department described \"negative developments in the human rights situation in Uganda,\" citing unlawful killings, \"arbitrary\" arrests, disappearances and a lack of action from the government to curb human rights abuses. The report also noted, however, that Uganda has worked with United Nations officials to provide humanitarian protection to refugees.",
      "Doris Meissner, who oversaw the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Clinton administration, said the U.S. government has long faced difficulties deporting some migrants due to diplomatic constraints. But she noted efforts to deport them to third countries were generally undertaken in \"exceptional\" cases only.",
      "Meissner, who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute think tank,  suggested the Trump administration may be employing different sources of leverage \u2014 like threats of visa sanctions and funding commitments \u2014 to persuade as many countries as possible to take in deportees from other nations.",
      "Noting deportations to third countries remain relatively limited in scale, Meissner said a main driver behind the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts is a desire to send a message of deterrence to those in the U.S. illegally, one that highlights the possibility that they could be sent to distant countries where they have no ties.",
      "\"The broader reason beyond that is fear and intimidation and ultimately, incentivizing self deportation,\" she said.",

      "The credit ratings agency, which issued its new assessment of the nation's fiscal health late Monday, said that it is holding its AA+/A-1+ rating steady, with a stable outlook.",
      "The fresh analysis comes after Moody's Ratings, another large credit ratings agency, downgraded the U.S. in May, highlighting investor concerns about the nation's growing debt and policy uncertainty sparked by President Trump's trade policies. While S&P highlighted a range of economic concerns in its report, including the impact of new tax cuts against a backdrop of already high U.S. debt and deficits, the agency also underscored the resiliency of the nation's economy as well as the new tariff revenue generated by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Amid the rise in effective tariff rates, we expect meaningful tariff revenue to generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes that might otherwise be associated with the recent fiscal legislation, which contains both cuts and increases in tax and spending,\" S&P analysts wrote in the ratings note.",
      "The report added, \"The ratings on the U.S. are based on its wealthy, diversified and resilient economy, with per capita GDP over $89,000 in 2025. Since the pandemic, U.S. growth has far surpassed that of its peers.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The fresh ratings assessment comes as the U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown, with GDP decelerating to an average rate of 1.25% during the first half of the year, compared with 2.8% in 2024. The job market also faltered in July, with employers adding a disappointing 73,000 jobs last month,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department \u2014 far fewer than economists had forecast.",
      "The weak jobs data suggests that businesses are delaying hiring amid the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's new tariff regime, which has been exacerbated by numerous postponements and rate changes.",
      "Amid those headwinds, the revenue generated from tariffs is surging: The U.S. government collected about $30 billion from import duties\u00a0in July, according to the Treasury Department. That amounts to a 242% jump in tariff revenue since July 2024.",
      "While that new revenue will help bolster the nation's finances, it comes at a cost to American consumers and businesses, economists say. Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers \u2014 from\u00a0small businesses to large retailers and manufacturers \u2014 when they accept goods from foreign countries at U.S. ports. Typically, those businesses then raise their prices to cover the costs of these duties, according to economists.",
      "Because of that dynamic, tariffs are viewed as a tax on consumers by economists, with the Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank,\u00a0estimating that the new import duties will cost the average taxpayer about $2,700 in additional costs in 2026.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 07:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says he plans to sign an executive order \"to end mail-in ballots, because they're corrupt.\" Here's what to know about his claims.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.",
      "\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"",
      "Why does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?",
      "\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.",
      "But soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"",
      "\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.",
      "After that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"",
      "In 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.",
      "The White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"",
      "\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.",
      "Trump's impending executive order to stop mail voting \u2014 would it be legal?",
      "In a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "He claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"",
      "But Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.",
      "Trump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"",
      "In fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany\u00a0and Denmark are among them.",
      "Mail-in voting in the U.S.",
      "In the U.S., mail voting is widespread:\u00a036 states offer some form of no-excuse mail-in voting \u2014 including 8 states that conduct elections entirely by mail \u2014 while the rest require a documented reason such as illness or military service, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
      "The topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.",
      "David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"",
      "\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News in a statement Monday night that \"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Former Attorney General William Barr is the first person scheduled to be deposed by Congress members as questions surrounding his role in the Epstein investigation persist.",
    "story": [
      "In the hours after convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan detention cell, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr pledged to intervene personally to lead the investigation into Epstein's death.",
      "Among the first to arrive at the Metropolitan Correctional Center soon after Epstein's death in August 2019 were members of Barr's senior staff. The visit to the federal detention center by senior members of the attorney general's staff was highly unusual, a source who was there at the time and witnessed the visit told CBS News. But so was the death in custody of such a controversial figure.",
      "One source didn't recall ever seeing members of the attorney general's senior staff investigate an inmate death in more than 20 years. Another source, involved in the investigation, said such senior visits were rare, and if they occurred, usually pertained to promoting correctional programs, not investigating inmate deaths.",
      "Barr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "Last month, after the FBI made that video public, an\u00a0analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed \u2014 including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.",
      "Now, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.",
      "Sources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.",
      "The deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.",
      "Epstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.",
      "Scrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Campaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.",
      "The release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.",
      "As Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled\u00a0to be deposed by the committee.",
      "Barr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "As attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)",
      "Here is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.",
      "Questions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation",
      "Did the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?",
      "Before the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.",
      "That was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.",
      "Does Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?",
      "Barr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.",
      "Just before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.",
      "What did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?",
      "No evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.",
      "A private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.",

      "\"I told him that we're going to set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet, and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I'll meet and we'll wrap it up,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that it takes \"two to tango,\" and that \"they have to have somewhat of a relationship, otherwise, we're just wasting a lot of time.\"",
      "It is still unclear whether the bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would be immediately followed by trilateral talks in the same location, or if Mr. Trump would make arrangements to participate in trilateral talks in a different city on another date after Putin and Zelenskyy have met.",
      "Zelenskyy told CBS News shortly after leaving the White House that a date had not been set to meet with Putin. In a post on X Tuesday, Zelenskyy called the talks in Washington \"truly a significant step toward ending the war and ensuring the security of Ukraine and our people.\"",
      "\"We are already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Today, we continue coordination at the level of leaders. There will be discussions, and we are preparing the relevant formats.\"",
      "A Russian spokesperson would only say that high-level talks would take place, but would not confirm that Putin would be involved.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met with Putin in Alaska last week, expressed urgency around the timing of the next meeting, suggesting that waiting too long would result in thousands of deaths. In what appeared to be a hot mic moment Monday, Mr. Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin \"wants to make a deal for me.\"",
      "The president outlined on Fox that he has been surprised that Zelenskyy and Putin are \"getting along a little bit better than I thought,\" adding that \"they're the ones that have to call the shots.\"",
      "\"We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks, that I can tell you, and we're going to see where it all goes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's possible that he doesn't want to make a deal.\"",
      "At the White House press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Putin and Zelenskyy have \"expressed a willingness to sit down with each other,\" and that \"accommodations for that meeting are underway.\"",
      "Meanwhile, security guarantees for Ukraine emerged as a key issue during Monday's meetings, with Zelenskyy calling them a \"starting point towards ending the war.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the U.S. will work with European and other allies to provide security guarantees for Ukraine after the war, although he did not provide specifics. And Macron said discussions on what the U.S. is willing to provide could begin as soon as Tuesday.",
      "On the security guarantees, Mr. Trump said the European leaders are \"willing to put people on the ground,\" and that \"we're willing to help them with things, especially, probably if you could talk about by air because there's nobody has the kind of stuff we have.\" But the president added that \"I don't think it's going to be a problem.\"",
      "\"There will be some form of security,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It can't be NATO, because that was a \u2014 that's just not something that would ever, ever happen.\"",
      "Leavitt outlined Mr. Trump's position Tuesday afternoon, saying \"the president has definitely stated U.S. boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies.\"",
      "\"The president understands security guarantees are crucially important to secure a lasting peace and he has directed his national security team to coordinate with our friends in Europe,\" she added.",

      "During the talks in the Oval Office on Monday, a map of Ukraine was displayed that showed areas of Ukrainian territory that are currently controlled by Russia or that are contested, with the estimated percentage of Russian control listed for each region, seen below.",
      "One area that Putin is believed to want Ukraine to give up as a condition for peace is the eastern Donbas region, which has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. It is made up of two oblasts, or provinces, called Donetsk and Luhansk.",
      "Residents of this region are largely Russian-speaking and parts of the area have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since a Russian-supported insurgency ramped up in 2014.",
      "At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Putin recognized the independence of these separatist regions and was accused of using their protection as a pretext for Russia's invasion, making a televised address in which he claimed the self-proclaimed people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk had appealed to Russia for help.",
      "Despite Russian forces then invading and holding portions of eastern Ukraine, through the course of the war they have failed to capture the region completely.",
      "Zelenskyy has rejected\u00a0surrendering Ukrainian territory to Russia, including in the Donbas region, as part of a ceasefire deal.",
      "And Ukraine's leader would not technically be allowed to cede any Ukrainian lands to Russia, as part of ceasefire negotiations or otherwise, because doing so could violate Ukraine's constitution, which specifically\u00a0outlines the territories of Ukraine.",
      "That also means Zelenskyy can't cede the territory of Crimea, which was invaded and annexed by Russia in 2014.",
      "Instead, some analysts have suggested that, to achieve a ceasefire agreement, a deal could be struck to essentially freeze the front line \u2014 which snakes roughly 620 miles from northeastern Ukraine to its southern coast on the Black Sea \u2014 without Ukraine officially giving away the land on the other side.",
      "Zelenskyy also has warned that ceding any of Ukraine's territory to Russia could benefit Russia in any future potential aggression toward Ukraine.",
      "Putin has clearly stated that he believes Ukraine is part of Russia politically, culturally and linguistically, and Ukraine fears a pause in the fighting without robust security guarantees from the U.S. or European allies would leave the door open for Putin to rebuild Russia's military capabilities and invade again.",
      "\"For the Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a future new offensive,\" Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's\u00a0meeting with Putin. \"If we leave Donbas of our own accord or under pressure, we will invite a third war.\"",

    "summary": "Meteorologists are closely tracking the projected path and forecast of Hurricane Erin, which is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin threatened the East Coast with dangerous rip currents as the large storm moved on a projected path up the Atlantic Ocean, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Tuesday. The hurricane\u00a0isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but people in North Carolina's Outer Banks were warned of possible coastal flooding that triggered evacuation orders.",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was downgraded to a Category 2 storm Tuesday morning as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. It previously\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to a Category 3 early Sunday morning, then regaining strength again later in the day.",
      "As of 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph and was moving north-northwest at 10 mph. The storm's center was about 615 miles southwest of Bermuda and about the same distance south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.",
      "A\u00a0Category 2 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 96 mph to 110 mph. Erin was just under what's considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Forecasters said fluctuations in Erin's intensity were possible over the next few days.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "The center of the storm was expected to pass to the east of the Bahamas on Tuesday night and move between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast Wednesday and Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin is already a large storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 80 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the string of barrier islands along the North Carolina coast known as the Outer Banks, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch was issued north of the Outer Banks to Virginia's Atlantic coast, and for Bermuda. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge warning was also issued for the Outer Banks, meaning there was a danger of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding that was expected to start Wednesday.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "When is Hurricane Erin expected to impact the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly, but the initial effects of the storm were expected to be seen as early as Tuesday afternoon's high tide cycle along the North Carolina coast, according to the National Weather Service office for Newport/Morehead City.",
      "The worst conditions were expected late Wednesday through Thursday, when the center of Erin was expected to be at its closest point to the coast, according to the weather service. At that time, forecasters\u00a0warn, severe flooding could reach buildings and roads along the Outer Banks. Many roadways will likely be under several feet of water and inaccessible for several days due to the flooding.",
      "Mandatory evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the expected flooding.",
      "Coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard will feel the effects of Erin with dangerous rip currents and high waves of 10 to over 20 feet over the next several days.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches ranging from South Florida up to New England are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches on Tuesday,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, have already prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

      "The Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, made the announcement\u00a0on its Facebook page\u00a0early Tuesday.",
      "It came after the union and Air Canada resumed talks late Monday for the first time since the strike began over the weekend. The walkout affected about 130,000 travelers a day at the peak of the summer travel season.",
      "Canada's largest airline said flights will start resuming Tuesday evening.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "The union said the agreement will guarantee members pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, resolving one of the major issues that drove the strike.",
      "\"Unpaid work is over. We have reclaimed our voice and our power,\" the union said in a statement. \"When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back \u2014 and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on.\"",
      "Air Canada Chief Executive Michael Rousseau said restarting a major carrier is a complex undertaking and said regular service may require seven to 10 days. Some flights will be canceled until the schedule is stabilized.",
      "\"Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,\" Rousseau said in a statement.",
      "The two sides reached the deal with the help of a mediator early Tuesday morning. The airline said mediation discussions \"were begun on the basis that the union commit to have the airline's 10,000 flight attendants immediately return to work.\" Air Canada declined to comment further on the agreement until the ratification process is complete. It noted a strike or lockout is not possible during this time.",
      "The union said it is \"required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,\" adding that the talks that settled the strike began at 7 p.m. Monday lasted until 4:23 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, Air Canada said rolling cancellations would extend through Tuesday afternoon after the union defied a second return-to-work order.",
      "The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal Monday and ordered the flight attendants back on the job. But the union said it would defy the directive. Union leaders also ignored a weekend order to submit to binding arbitration and end the strike by Sunday afternoon.",
      "The board is an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws. The government ordered the board to intervene.",
      "Labor leaders objected to the Canadian government's repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere.",
      "\"Your right to vote on your wages was preserved,\" the union said in a post on its website.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day. The airline estimated Monday that 500,000 customers would be affected by flight cancellations.",
      "Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Monday afternoon, Air Canada had called off at least 1,219 domestic flights and 1,339 international flights since last Thursday, when the carrier began gradually suspending its operations ahead of the strike and lockout that began early Saturday.",

The circumstances around each death are under investigation.",
      "In the first incident, officers were alerted to a 79-year-old man who was unresponsive on board a commercial ship at the resort. Police said an initial report suggested the man lost consciousness while snorkeling at a beach, and a lifeguard pulled him from the water to administer CPR. The man, reported to be an American national, was ultimately pronounced dead by a doctor, according to police.",
      "Officers later found a 74-year-old woman unresponsive on board a separate commercial ship. The initial police report in that incident suggested that the woman, also reported to be American, lost consciousness while swimming in a pool. Similar to the first case, police said a lifeguard pulled her from the water and attempted CPR before she was also pronounced dead.",

      "Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.",
      "\"Despite all of the diplomacy and peace efforts, Russia continues to kill civilians,\" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha said in a social media post. \"Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure. Moscow must stop the killing in order to advance diplomacy.\"",
      "Russian state media reported Ukraine had carried out a drone attack in Donetsk, overnight which killed a 62-year-old woman.",
      "Monday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy comes months after a contentious February Oval Office meeting between the two leaders and Vice President JD Vance exposed a severe rift, with tensions erupting on camera as Vance accused Zelenskyy of ingratitude. In recent months, Mr. Trump's posture appeared to shift as he expressed frustration with Putin over Russia's ongoing drone and missile attacks, including what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022.",

Both measures passed with strong support, Prop 20 by more than 61%, because people wanted to stop gerrymandering and take power away from politicians. They voted for fairness, transparency, and accountability. Governor Newsom\u2019s plan ignores that decision and tries to take back power for himself and Sacramento insiders.

There is no debate. There's no input. Even the legislature in California doesn't have input. The DCCC is just ending it. That is why we need to stop Newsom's power grab.\"",
      "McCarthy, who is helping to lead the GOP fundraising effort to counter Newsom and California Democrats leading up to the likely referendum this autumn, said that \"November 4th will be the election that people could actually have a say,\" as he pointed to polls showing strong support for the current non-partisan redistricting commission.",

      "Google has confirmed that a hacking group known as ShinyHunters stole customer data from one of its internal Salesforce databases used to manage business client relationships. The company disclosed the breach in a blog post published in early August, noting that the stolen data included\u00a0\"basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach was carried out by ShinyHunters, a well-known cybercriminal group formally tracked as UNC6040. The group has recently been linked to a string of high-profile incidents involving companies such as AT&T, Ticketmaster, Allianz Life and Pandora. In this case, the attackers targeted Google's corporate Salesforce system, which the company uses to store contact information and notes about small and medium-sized businesses.",

      "Cisco, Qantas and Pandora have all reported similar breaches in recent months, which now appear to be part of a broader campaign targeting cloud-based customer relationship management tools.",
      "In its blog post, Google warned that ShinyHunters may be preparing a public leak site. Ransomware gangs often use this tactic to extort companies, threatening to publish stolen data.

      "While organizations like Google may be prime targets, individuals are often the weakest link that attackers exploit. But with a few smart practices, you can dramatically reduce your risk.",
      "The Google breach happened because employees gave up sensitive information over a phone call. No legitimate IT team will ever ask you to share your password or 2FA codes over the phone. If someone does, it's a major red flag.",

      "Phishing emails and messages often include links that take you to fake websites designed to steal your login credentials or personal information. These messages usually create a sense of urgency, asking you to verify an account, reset a password or claim a reward. Instead of clicking the link, take a moment to inspect the message.",

      "2. Shredding and mixing: Machines shred the cleaned fibers and combine them with synthetic hydrocarbon wax, which serves as a binder.",
      "3. Pellet formation: The blended material is pressed, heated and cut into small pellets that can be easily stored and transported.",
      "4. Asphalt integration: These pellets are added to reclaimed asphalt and bitumen. During heating, the pellets melt and release reinforcing fibers that strengthen the final asphalt mix.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",

      "What cities are doing next with recycled cigarette butts",

As more cities explore cleaner, smarter infrastructure, this kind of solution could play a big role in the future of street design.",

These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",

      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data.

      "FIRST ON FOX: A move aimed at lowering tensions between South and North Korea is threatening, rather than improving, life for the estimated 400,000 Christians who live in the North. The policy has been slammed as \"a catastrophic strategic mistake.\"",
      "South Korea\u2019s new President, Lee Jae-myung, ordered a reported 80% of radio broadcasts from the South, beamed into the North, to stop transmitting in May. The President also declared that loudspeakers that had been broadcasting anti-communist propaganda\u00a0on the border between the two countries should be taken down.",
      "Myung reportedly told his Cabinet in Seoul, \"I hope such reciprocal measures will gradually lead to dialogue and communication\" between the two Koreas, the Korea Times reported Tuesday, adding that the South Korean President wants South and North Korea to \"shift from a relationship that causes harm to each other to one that is mutually beneficial.\"",

      "But the shutdown of radio stations is having a drastic effect on North Korea\u2019s Christians. The Kim Jong-un regime has ruled that it is a crime to worship Christianity. Even being found with a Bible can lead to execution, normally with a bullet, sometimes reportedly after torture.",
      "There\u2019s no general access to the internet for ordinary citizens.\u00a0The only practical way Christians can experience the Gospel and Christian teaching or thoughts is to secretly listen to a radio. But now the Stimson Center\u2019s 38 North, a publication analyzing data on North Korea, says broadcasts into the country from the South, including broadcasts previously backed by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, have been cut back by almost 80% since May, and they advise that level could fall even further over the coming months.",
      "Kim Jong Un depicted riding a horse atop Mount Paektu, a sacred site in North Korea.\u00a0 (KCNA)",
      "It\u2019s also reported that it is more difficult to hear the Christian message now. Because there are fewer broadcasts still going into the North, authorities are said to be having greater success\u00a0in electronically jamming them.",
      "A U.S. State Department spokesperson expressed concern, telling Fox News Digital, \"Under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Rubio, the State Department Office of International Religious Freedom is actively looking into new ways to advance freedom of religion\u00a0around the world, including in North Korea, and for North Korea\u2019s severely persecuted Christian community. President Trump is a champion for religious freedom globally, including defending people\u2019s ability to read the Bible and freely access religious texts.\"",
      "It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of these broadcasts to Christians in North Korea, Timothy Cho, who defected from the country when he was 17, told Fox News Digital from London. Cho serves on the Secretariat of the British government\u2019s All-Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea, saying \"we are sharing the Gospel with our brothers and sisters on the ground in North Korea. This significance we cannot compare with any amount of values, because it is hope. It is hope, and it is light and it is the message they can rely on during the darkest time inside North Korea.\"",

He explained that\u2019s why Christianity is so feared by the government. He added that \"the most dangerous threat to North Korean authority is the claim of there being a true God who is not connected to the Kim dynasty.\"",
      "\"Underground Christianity provides a space for the free exchange of ideas. Christianity is a defining feature of the DNA of the Korean people,\" Greg Scarlatiou, President and CEO of the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told Fox News Digital. \"The Kim family regime wants none of that, having tried so hard to obliterate the true identity of the Korean people.\"",
      "\"The shutting down of radio stations beaming information into North Korea is a catastrophic strategic mistake. True change can't come from the Kim family. It can only come from the people of North Korea, especially Christians. And the only thing the outside world can do to help them is empowerment through information.\"",
      "North Korea is at the top of Open Doors\u2019 World Watch List for persecution of Christians again this year. Open Doors is a global organization that supports and speaks up for Christians persecuted for their faith. The report noted, \"Police and intelligence agents search homes without warning. If they find Christian materials, it is considered a crime against the nation, and the whole family can be banished, imprisoned or executed. Those who use an unregistered smartphone or radio to access unapproved media are punished.\"",
      "The report continued, \"Christians only dare to listen to radio programs at night, hidden under blankets. Each act of worship, even though conducted by oneself, is perceived as an \"act of extreme disloyalty.\" Citizens are trained to report anyone who might be an enemy of the regime, including family members.",

      "\"What we know, what our members know, is that we go call to call to call out on the streets at night, going from robbery to carjacking to stabbing to shooting, and we just know that crime is ubiquitous, and it\u2019s all in every quadrant of the city,\" Pemberton said. \"So to have people tell us, 'well, crime is down, you shouldn\u2019t be worried about that,' that\u2019s not the reality that we feel on the streets.\"",
      "Neither the Justice Department nor the U.S. attorney\u2019s office is commenting on the investigation. The police department did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

      "Roll out the cosmic welcome mat for our solar system\u2019s newest resident: a never-before-seen moon orbiting Uranus.",
      "A team of astronomers announced Tuesday that a new satellite measuring roughly 90 football fields across was discovered around the seventh planet from the sun. The moon, which was first seen by NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope on Feb. 2, joins a busy neighborhood of 28 other known moons around Uranus.",
      "The Webb telescope\u2019s observations of Uranus are giving scientists better insight into one of the more mysterious planets in our solar system.",
      "\u201cNo other planet has as many small inner moons as Uranus,\u201d Matthew Tiscareno, a member of the research team and a senior research scientist at the SETI Institute in California, said in a statement.",
      "Tiscareno said the \u201ccomplex inter-relationships\u201d between Uranus\u2019 moons and its faint rings suggest the planet\u2019s evolutionary history may have been a chaotic one.",
      "\u201cMoreover, the new moon is smaller and much fainter than the smallest of the previously known inner moons, making it likely that even more complexity remains to be discovered,\u201d he said in the statement.",
      "The newfound satellite is about 35,000 miles from the center of the planet, with a near circular orbit, according to the researchers.",
      "It\u2019s only about 6 miles across \u2014 a distance that can be walked in about two hours at a brisk pace \u2014 but follow-up observations are needed to confirm the moon\u2019s size and other characteristics.",
      "The discovery has also not yet been peer-reviewed.",
      "Uranus has five large, outer moons named Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon. The newly discovered moon is inside the orbits of the five larger moons, the researchers said.",
      "All of Uranus\u2019 moons are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope, according to NASA. The new moon does not yet have a name, though any designation will eventually need to be approved by the International Astronomical Union, which oversees the official naming process for astronomical objects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small moon but a significant discovery, which is something that even NASA\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft didn\u2019t see during its flyby nearly 40 years ago,\u201d Maryame El Moutamid, a lead scientist in the Southwest Research Institute\u2019s Solar System Science and Exploration Division, said in a statement.",
      "In 1986, the Voyager 2 probe became the first human-made object to fly past Uranus, giving humanity its first close-up views of the distant planet. The historic encounter yielded more than 7,000 photographs of Uranus and helped scientists discover two new rings and 11 new moons around the planet.",
      "The newest moon\u2019s tiny size likely made it too small for Voyager 2\u2019s cameras to see, but the Webb telescope\u2019s high-resolution instruments may shed more light on the planet and its system.",
      "\u201cLooking forward, the discovery of this moon underscores how modern astronomy continues to build upon the legacy of missions like Voyager 2,\u201d El Moutamid said in the statement. \u201cNow, nearly four decades later, the James Webb Space Telescope is pushing that frontier even farther.\u201d"

    "summary": "European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday in a rare display of unity to end the war with Russia.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Seven European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday in a rare display of trans-Atlantic unity. The gathering marked the first time in decades that such a broad delegation of allies had assembled at the White House under such pressing circumstances.",
      "Shortly after noon, one by one, the heads of state and NATO partners passed the White House gates, where they were met by President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of protocol, and in Zelenskyy\u2019s case, by Trump himself.",
      "Some met with Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and other officials that morning. Others made their way to the White House directly from Dulles and other airports. They were there to bolster Zelenskyy after a disastrous White House visit in February, when he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 and after Trump held a nearly three-hour one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.",
      "The show of support for Zelenskyy involved French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who pivoted from their own national agendas to present a united front as Trump seeks an urgent end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "The display took place within days of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska and ahead of a possible Trump-brokered meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy as Trump casts himself as a potential peace broker.",
      "Inside the Oval Office on Monday, evoking a boardroom scene, Trump sat behind the Resolute desk, military flags at his back, as Zelenskyy and the European delegation faced him, as reflected in a photo shared by the White House. Made of oak timbers taken from a British ship, the desk is a hulking 19th century reminder of goodwill between important allies, a gift from Britain's Queen Victoria to the United States. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are seen orbiting in the background, along with senior White House staff members.",
      "There are few precedents for the gathering, which merged diplomacy with Trump\u2019s usual verve.",
      "In 1941, Franklin Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill off the coast of Newfoundland to sign the Atlantic Charter, laying out the Allied aims for the end of World War II and meetings that would decide the fate of Europe and Asia. During the Cold War, summits in Washington helped decide the terms of German reunification. They included meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev amid a key question over whether Germany would join NATO. And in 1950, the British prime minister rushed to Washington to consult Harry Truman over fears of the possible use of nuclear weapons during the Korean War.",
      "\u201cWashington has often been the scene of these great moments of diplomacy. But it was the speed with which this came together that was so striking and sets this apart,\u201d said Marc Selverstone, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center of Public Affairs. \u201cEveryone realized this was a crisis moment.\u201d",
      "The urgency was reflected in how quickly the past few days' events came together: Trump\u2019s talks with Putin on Friday were followed by the leaders\u2019 arrival in Washington on Monday morning. \u201cEvery single one of them got on a plane 48 hours later and flew to the United States of America,\u201d said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, rushing to Washington in a bid to keep momentum toward peace in Ukraine alive.",
      "The day also offered other made-for-TV moments, as Trump escorted the leaders to a gift shop of sorts, which he dubbed the \u201cMonica Lewinsky room\u201d in reference to a former president\u2019s trysts, where he showed off rows of fire engine red hats emblazoned with his campaign slogans, including one for 2028. At another point, Trump deflected a question to Zelenskyy about Ukraine\u2019s elections to joke about serving a third term himself.",
      "Told through photos shared online by his team, Trump presented a towering figure in Monday's meetings. In a picture posted by deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, Zelenskyy stood before a map of Ukraine as Trump looked down at him. Another image posted by the White House showed Trump seated behind his historic desk, this time with Vance and Rubio before him, the phone handset resting on the desk as he talked with Putin.",
      "For Zelenskyy, Monday also offered a reset. After a tense Oval Office meeting this year, he struck a more diplomatic tone Monday, offering Trump and others his thanks more than a dozen times, including for the invitation, for Trump\u2019s efforts \u201cto stop killings and stop this war,\u201d for Melania Trump\u2019s letter to Putin asking him to protect children, for a program to purchase American weapons and to the European partners for their support. On his X account, he offered profuse, continued thanks well into Tuesday.",
      "Wearing a suit instead of his usual military fatigues, he told Trump as he greeted him that the attire was \u201cthe best I had.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said, ultimately sharing a video of the warm exchange on his social media platform, Truth Social.",
      "Asked what his message to the people of Ukraine was, Trump told a reporter, \u201cWe love them.\u201d",
      "Vance, who had publicly clashed with Zelenskyy in their last White House meeting, also sought to smooth relations, posting a photo of their handshake.",
      "Finland\u2019s participation carried its own symbolic weight, with one reminder of a path out of a seemingly intractable conflict with a nuclear-powered Soviet Union, which Stubb referred to directly.",
      "\u201cWe, of course, have our own historical experience with Russia from World War II, the Winter War and the War of Continuation,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cAnd if I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a solution in 2025.\u201d"

      "Trump said he would subject the museums to \u201cthe exact same process\u201d his administration has conducted of universities, with the goal of making the Smithsonian less \u201cwoke.\u201d",
      "A White House official told NBC News on Tuesday night that Trump plans to extend his review of museums beyond the Washington-based institution, saying the president will hold the Smithsonian \"accountable\" and \"then go from there.\"",
      "Trump wrote on Truth Social: \u201cThe Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been \u2014 Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are not going to allow this to happen, and I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums, and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where tremendous progress has been made,\u201d he added.",
      "The Smithsonian did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The White House has waged war on several colleges and universities, pulling millions in federal funding from schools like Harvard, Columbia and Brown, alleging they fostered antisemitic climates and lowering the hammer on their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Some of the schools have reached agreements with the administration walking back some of their DEI efforts, pledging to comply with federal policies and in some cases paying the government hundreds of millions of dollars.",
      "The Trump administration last week began conducting an unprecedented review of exhibits at the Smithsonian ahead of the country\u2019s 250th anniversary in an effort to make sure they comply with Trump\u2019s vision of history.",
      "The Smithsonian received a letter signed by White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought last week instructing officials at eight of its museums to turn over information about exhibits and plans to commemorate the country\u2019s 250th anniversary within 30 days.",
      "It instructed the officials to implement \u201ccontent corrections\u201d where necessary, including replacing \u201cdivisive\u201d language.",
      "NBC News found in May that at least 32 artifacts once on display at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall were removed, prompting questions from historical leaders. One artifact included a book belonging to Harriet Tubman, which was filled with hymns she was believed to have sung when she was leading enslaved people to freedom.",
      "The Smithsonian, which comprises 21 museums, 14 education and research centers and a zoo, is the world\u2019s largest complex of its kind. The bulk of its funding comes from Congress, but its curatorial process is independent."

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Josh Hawley irks fellow Republicans as he tries to carve out a lane",
      "Since he took office in 2019, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has sought to place himself on the front lines of orienting the Republican Party around a mix of economic populism and social conservatism to appeal to an increasingly working-class base.",
      "But now, with Republicans in full control of Congress for the first time since he arrived in Washington, Hawley\u2019s mission is coming into conflict with members of his party, who are frustrated with his tendency to follow the beat of his own drum as he grows more critical of some of their policy aims.",
      "Republicans, both in Congress and in the White House, are increasingly talking about Hawley\u2019s moves with the assumption that he is considering a presidential campaign, five people familiar with such discussions told NBC News.",
      "A senior Senate aide said it appeared that Hawley was \u201ctrying to load up policy prescriptions to lay the groundwork for a 2028 presidential bid.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s aligned himself with Democrats on most fiscal issues,\u201d the aide added. \u201cFrankly, it has irked a lot of his Republican colleagues.\u201d",
      "But Hawley\u2019s allies say no 2028 plotting is afoot.",
      "\u201cJosh believes we\u2019re at a critical inflection point in our history about where the party\u2019s realigning,\u201d a person close to him said. \u201cHe\u2019s been on the same mission, focusing on the same project since he first ran for office, believing that the Republican Party needs to become a party of working people. What he\u2019s done is consistent with that each year he\u2019s been in Congress.\u201d",
      "Across the aisle: Hawley had been written off by Democrats after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, when he was seen entering the Capitol raising a fist to protesters assembled outside and later moved forward with his objection to the electoral vote count.",
      "But this year alone, Hawley has teamed up with Sens., Gary Peters, D-Mich., on a bill to ban congressional stock trading; Cory Booker, D-N.J., on legislation to enhance child labor laws; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., on a bill to bar artificial intelligence firms from training models on stolen, copyrighted materials; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on an effort to cap credit card interest rates; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation to further regulate pharmacy benefit managers, among other measures.",
      "\u201cWell, Jan. 6 remains in the back of a lot of people\u2019s minds. At the same time, on issues where we can make progress stopping corporate greed or monopolistic control over markets, there\u2019s a need for allies,\u201d Blumenthal said in an interview. \u201cThe iconic Jan. 6 photo of him with a fist in the air can\u2019t be erased from memory.

      "California\u2019s long ballot count may be Trump\u2019s next target in the war over voting",
      "The latest salvo in President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign against mail-in voting arrived Monday, as he announced he wants to \u201clead a movement\u201d against mail ballots and advocate instead for in-person and paper ballots, which he says are \u201cfaster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election.\u201d",
      "This push by Trump may also have the convenience of being the latest line of attack in the redistricting wars. In California, state Democrats are attempting their own mid-decade gerrymander to counter the Trump-led push by Republicans to draw more friendly districts in Texas. And California sticks out as one of the most prominent embracers of mail-in voting \u2014 and among the slowest to count them.",
      "Overall, mail-in voting accounted for 30% of the total vote nationwide in 2024, down from its 2020 peak of 43%. However, in California, the practice made up 81% of the total vote, according to a recent report from the Election Assistance Commission.",
      "Mail-in voting overall has proved to be a challenging process for many election administrators, with hurdles including voter and ballot verification and logistical issues like opening envelopes, keeping materials secure and, in many cases, hand-counting. Essentially, all of the processes that happen in person when someone votes at a polling place \u2014 especially checking in and verifying their registration \u2014 can pile up fast when it happens by mail.",
      "But California has had some of the greatest difficulties sorting through mail votes quickly. Of the states with the highest share of mail-in voting in the 2024 election, California set a benchmark for slowest progress the morning after the election.",
      "While Democrats have achieved steady success at the statewide level in recent years, California\u2019s prolonged vote counts left the nation in suspense over which party would win control of the House of Representatives for days after the 2022 and 2024 elections.",
      "Legislation was introduced this year requiring California counties to conclude a majority of their counting process 13 days after the election. The bill passed the state Assembly with bipartisan support and is in a state Senate committee seeking funding sign-off.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump faces high legal and political hurdles to changing mail-in laws on his own at the federal level. Without new federal laws, states have wide latitude to set their own election procedures.",
      "But it\u2019s also happening as California state legislators convened Monday to move forward on plans for a congressional map that, if approved by voters, would target five Republicans to lose their seats in the upcoming midterms. The effort was sparked by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom as a response to Texas Republicans\u2019 congressional redraw seeking to fortify their majority.",

      "Minutes after emerging from a four-hour meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several other European leaders at the White House on Monday, Stubb described the results to NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhat we have agreed on is to work on European and American security guarantees, essentially, which will be secure from the European perspective, coordinated with the Americans,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s us who decide what kind of security guarantees we put up for Ukraine, not the Russians.\u201d",
      "He responded sharply to Russia\u2019s immediate rejection of the idea that those security guarantees would potentially include a NATO presence.",

      "For Stubb, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is personal. Both his father and grandfather were born in cities that were ceded to Russia following Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s 1939 invasion of Finland and that remain part of Russia today. That history informs his commitment to Ukraine. Until Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Finland, which shares more than 800 miles of border with Russia, had remained steadfastly neutral for decades, including during the Cold War.",
      "Stubb described his country as a regional \u201csecurity provider,\u201d pointing to its mandatory military service, large reserve forces and arsenal of weapons. \u201cWe have over 60 F-18s. We just bought 64 F-35s. We have long-range missiles, air, land and sea, and we have the largest artillery in Europe, together with Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "Finland and other European countries represented at the White House on Monday \u2014 Britain, France, Germany and Italy, as well as the heads of the European Commission and NATO \u2014 are part of a group known as the Coalition of the Willing, which also met virtually on Tuesday. Stubb said they have been working on how to help secure Ukraine for some time, and decided at the White House meeting to order their militaries and civil servants to come up with a plan as soon as next week.",
      "A location for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not yet been determined, but Stubb suggested Switzerland as a possibility. \u201cGeneva could work actually,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be neutral territory for it.\u201d",
      "Stubb said the goal is for the meeting to happen as soon as possible, hopefully \u201cwithin the next two weeks.\u201d",
      "Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, said Tuesday morning that the country would grant Putin immunity to enter the country for such a meeting, despite an arrest warrant for him for war crimes by the International Criminal Court of Justice. Putin would be at risk of arrest in most other countries in Europe, among a total of 125 nations that observe the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction. The U.S. does not.",
      "18 holes and diplomacy",
      "Stubb gained Trump\u2019s ear over a round of golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, in March, when they competed together in a member-guest tournament at one of Trump\u2019s courses and Trump gifted Stubb a new set of clubs to replace the set Stubb had brought with him.",
      "According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked Stubb over lunch if he could trust Putin, and Stubb told him \u201cyou cannot.\u201d Hours later, the Journal noted, Trump publicly criticized Putin for the first time over his refusal to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine.",
      "The Journal also reported on informal calls and texts between the two leaders since then, including Trump sometimes consulting Stubb before speaking with Putin. Zelenskyy has also publicly thanked Stubb for helping him build a connection with Trump in the aftermath of Trump and Zelenskyy\u2019s infamously heated Oval Office meeting in February.",
      "Stubb also seems to have sensed how to communicate to Trump the extent of Putin\u2019s prospective land grab of Ukraine\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cFor an American audience,\u201d he told NBC News, \u201cthe best way to explain it is that if you take the relative land mass of what Russia wants right now from Ukraine, it would be a little bit like you giving up Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, even Virginia, and then bumping into Maryland.\u201d"

      "A group of Texas Democrats are returning to the state House in Austin where they will spend the night \u2014 the latest step in a broader protest over Republican plans to redraw congressional districts in the state.",
      "The state House Democratic caucus said in a news release that eight of its members will return to the floor Tuesday evening, \u201cpublicly tearing up the permission slips required by Republicans for members to leave the chamber.\u201d",
      "The Democrats will join state Rep. Nicole Collier, their colleague who has remained locked in the state House chamber since Monday afternoon after she refused the condition of a security escort to leave the chamber.",
      "After Democratic lawmakers fled the state for two weeks, denying the House a quorum to move forward with redistricting legislation, Republican leaders have demanded that Democrats agree to around-the-clock security escorts to ensure they would return to the chamber Wednesday for the redistricting vote.",
      "Collier didn\u2019t agree, so she has remained on the floor, while her party has livestreamed her protest for more than a day. Tuesday night, though, she\u2019ll have company ahead of passage of the redistricting plan in the House, which could happen as soon as Wednesday. The legislation is meant to pad the GOP majority in Washington.",
      "Collier has framed her decision to remain in the Capitol as an act of defiance, telling NBC News she wouldn\u2019t sign the de facto permission slip House GOP leaders presented to Democrats outlining the conditions that allowed them to leave the chamber.",
      "Those conditions are in effect because the House approved civil arrest warrants for the dozens of Democrats who left Texas this month.",

      "\u201cNicole was right. We should not have submitted to this,\u201d she added. \u201cI cannot support this very low and bad precedent for all future legislators.\u201d",
      "Rep. Rhetta Andrews Bowers told reporters that she also believed the decision to have law enforcement follow Democrats was a waste of taxpayer dollars, evoking last month's floods in the Hill Country that killed more than 100 people.",
      "\"Families in the Hill Country who lost everything to the devastating floods need our help. Yet instead of providing relief, those dollars are being spent on constant [Department of Public Safety] patrol,\" she said.",
      "Now that dozens of Democrats have returned to the state, there\u2019s little else they can do to prevent the GOP-controlled Legislature from passing their maps, which could help Republicans flip up to five U.S. House seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections."

      "Mexican boxer Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. has been deported from the United States and jailed in Mexico about one month after he was taken into custody by federal agents in Los Angeles\u2019 Studio City area.",
      "Arrest documents from Mexico\u2019s National Detention Registry show Ch\u00e1vez Jr. was taken into custody Monday. He was transferred from a border checkpoint to police custody and jailed in Sonora, Mexico.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was asked about the deportation proceeding during her morning press conference on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI understand he was deported. I don\u2019t know if it was yesterday or this morning, but we\u2019re informed that he was going to arrive in Mexico,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "The president also said, \u201cThere was an arrest warrant [against Ch\u00e1vez Jr.]. This was communicated several weeks ago. When he was arrested there [in Los Angeles], there was an arrest warrant in Mexico from the Attorney General\u2019s Office.\u201d",
      "Ch\u00e1vez Jr. was arrested in July outside his home by federal agents in Los Angeles\u2019 Studio City area in connection with an active warrant in Mexico, the Department of Homeland Security said. The 39-year-old former WBC middleweight world champion was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents just days after he was defeated by influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul in 10-round cruiserweight fight at Honda Center in Anaheim.",
      "The arrest stemmed from allegations of links to the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, according to the DHS.",
      "After Ch\u00e1vez Jr.\u2019s arrest, Sheinbaum confirmed the country has had a warrant for his arrest since 2023 that was part of an investigation that began in 2019. Sheinbaum said Mexico hadn\u2019t previously arrested the boxer on a 2023 arrest order because he had been mostly been in the United States since.",
      "Chavez Jr. claimed the middleweight title in June 2011 and defended the title three times. The son of a former multi-division boxing champion was born in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, and embarked on his professional boxing career as a teenager, making his debut in September 2002.",
      "The arrest came after weeks of federal immigration enforcement operations in the Los Angeles area after President Donald Trump made the issue a central part of his campaign. Operations have been reported in residential areas, car washes, home improvement store parking lots and other locations.",
      "The DHS said Chavez Jr. entered the country in August 2023 with a B2 tourist visa that was valid until 2024. He filed an application for Lawful Permanent Resident status last year based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen, whom the department also accused of having connections to the Sinaloa Cartel \u201cthrough a prior relationship with the now-deceased son of the infamous cartel leader Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman.\u201d",
      "In December, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services made a referral to ICE that Chavez Jr. is an \u201cegregious public safety threat,\u201d DHS said. In January, Chavez was allowed to re-enter the country at the San Ysidro Port of Entry near San Diego.",
      "He is accused of multiple \u201cfraudulent statements\u201d on the application for lawful permanent residence, according to the DHS, which deemed him removable from the United States on June 27.",
      "\u201cThis Sinaloa Cartel affiliate with an active arrest warrant for trafficking guns, ammunition, and explosives was arrested by ICE. It is shocking the previous administration flagged this criminal illegal alien as a public safety threat, but chose to not prioritize his removal and let him leave and come back into our country,\u201d said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \u201cUnder President Trump, no one is above the law\u2014including world-famous athletes. Our message to any cartel affiliates in the U.S. is clear: We will find you and you will face consequences. The days of unchecked cartel violence are over.\u201d",
      "Chavez Jr. has faced legal troubles in the United States, including a January 2024 arrest of illegal possession of an assault rifle. He spoke with NBCLA after the arrest and said he was \u201cready to move forward.\u201d",
      "NBCLA spoke with Ch\u00e1vez Jr.\u2019s attorney after the DHS announced the arrest.",
      "\u201cThis appears to be nothing more than another headline to terrorize the Latin community,\u201d attorney Michael A. Goldstein said, referring to immigration enforcement operations in Southern California. \u201cOn the case involving guns, a court granted mental health diversion, which Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was both eligible and suitable for under state statutes. He is in full compliance with his diversion, has completed all requirements asked of him, and we expect the case to be dismissed under the diversion statutes.",
      "Goldstein was asked in July about the cartel allegations.",
      "\u201cThis is the first we\u2019ve ever heard of these outrageous allegations,\u201d he said.",

      "Family members released a statement at the time of the arrest in July.",
      "\u201cOur family is profoundly concerned with the situation. During these difficult times, we reiterate our complete and unconditional support for Julio. We trust fully in his innocence and his character as we do the justice system in Mexico and in the U.S., hopeful the situation will clear up, adhering to his rights and the truth,\u201d wrote the Chavez family in the statement.",
      "During the immigration enforcement raids in Southern California, the administration has highlighted arrests involving undocumented individuals with violent crime convictions.

      "Andr\u00e9 and English alleged in their lawsuit that Clayton County officers stopped them in two separate incidents at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport inside the jet bridge as they were about to board flights. The Black celebrities say they were told to hand over their boarding passes and IDs and were asked whether they were carrying illegal drugs.",

      "The district court dismissed their lawsuit in 2023, citing the plaintiffs' \"failure to plausibly allege any constitutional violations,\" and all defendants, including Clayton County and the police department's chief, were protected by immunity. But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its opinion that it found that Andr\u00e9 and English \"plausibly alleged that Clayton County subjected them to unreasonable searches and seizures\" and reversed the dismissal \"after careful review.\"",
      "The court affirmed the rest of the district court's dismissal, which includes the celebrities' claim that the officers stopped them based on their race.",
      "The Clayton County Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did representatives for Andr\u00e9 and English.",
      "Two separate incidents, months apart",
      "English was traveling from Atlanta to Los Angeles for work in 2020 when, he says, Clayton County officers stopped him on the jet bridge after he had cleared security and a boarding pass check by a gate agent, according to his and Andr\u00e9's 2022 lawsuit.",
      "\"The officers flashed their badges and asked English whether he was carrying any illegal drugs,\" the lawsuit said. \"English denied carrying illegal drugs. English 'understood that he was not free to leave and continue his travel while the officers were questioning him.'\"",
      "Officers stood on either side of English, blocking his path to the plane, and asked him for his boarding pass and his ID, which he handed over because he felt he had no choice but to comply, according to the lawsuit. An officer also asked to search English's carry-on, which he allowed them to do, \"believing he had no choice.\"",
      "The officers let English go after they checked his bag, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"Throughout the encounter, Mr. English was worried that if he said anything the officers perceived as \u2018out of line,\u2019 he would not be allowed to board the plane or reach his destination,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "In 2021, Andr\u00e9 was traveling from Charleston, South Carolina, to Atlanta before heading home to Los Angeles, according to the lawsuit, which says he was stopped on the jet bridge trying to board his flight in Atlanta. Andr\u00e9 was also stopped on the jet bridge after having cleared multiple security points, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Officers also asked him whether he was carrying any illegal drugs, like cocaine or methamphetamine, which he denied, the lawsuit said. It alleged that he was also asked to hand over his ID and his boarding pass and that complied, believing he could not refuse.",
      "\"After approximately five minutes of standing in the narrow jet bridge and being questioned, Mr. Andr\u00e9 was told by the officers that he was free to leave and board the plane,\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "The stops were part of the Clayton County Police Department's \"drug interdiction program,\" which aims to selectively stop passengers on the jet bridge before they board flights to ask them whether they are carrying drugs and ask to search their luggage. The department claims the stops are random and consensual.",
      "Andr\u00e9 and English claim that the stops are not random or consensual and that the police program specifically targets Black passengers and other passengers of color, according to the court opinion.",
      "There were 402 jet bridge stops from Aug. 30, 2020, to April 30, 2021, according to police records, and passengers' races were listed for 378 of them. Of the 378 passengers, 211, or 56%, were Black, and people of color accounted for 258 total stops, or 68%, the celebrities' lawsuit said, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Andr\u00e9 called the experience \"dehumanizing and demoralizing.\"",
      "\"People were gawking at me, and I looked suspicious when I had done nothing wrong,\" Andr\u00e9 said when the lawsuit was filed.",
      "The court's decision",
      "In its decision, the federal appeals court held that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the coercive nature of the defendants' actions during their stops made Andr\u00e9 and English feel that they were not free to leave or that they were \"seized\" by the officers, meaning they plausibly alleged that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated.",
      "English \"plausibly alleged that the officers stopped him and began asking questions without telling him he could leave until after they finished questioning him,\" the court said, adding that it came to the same conclusion with Andr\u00e9.",
      "Barry Friedman, the director of the Policing Project at New York University's School of Law, who gave an oral argument this year in support of the appeal, said he is glad the federal court \"recognized the validity\" of Andr\u00e9 and English's Fourth Amendment claims.",
      "\"In the United States, you may not be seized or have your belongings searched unless you truly voluntarily consent or the government has at least reasonable suspicion to justify the seizure,\" Friedman said in a statement. \"Never has that basic constitutional principle been more important.\"",
      "Friedman said he is looking forward to returning to trial court on behalf of the comedians.",
      "However, the court did not find that the comedians were able to plausibly allege that the officers were acting with discriminatory purpose when they stopped them, citing that Andr\u00e9 and English \"do not allege that the individual defendants knew of any racially discriminatory complaint or saw the County\u2019s logs or that the County directed the individual defendants to single out Black passengers for interdictions.\"",
      "\"For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that plaintiffs plausibly alleged that defendants violated their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures,\" the court said. \"The individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, but Clayton County is not. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment claims against Clayton County. We affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims.\""

And while you can use the cloths dry, damp cloths are much better at holding onto debris, says Mock. \u201cA dry cloth may just push the dust around or create static that attracts more dust,\u201d she says. You can wet microfiber cloths with water, an all-purpose cleaning solution or disinfectant, but be careful not to add too much, as it can leave streaks on surfaces.",

Then, as you wipe dust off surfaces, the sponge\u2019s ridged exterior traps particles. The sponge also compresses so you can squeeze it into tight spaces. When it gets dirty, you can rinse it off and reuse it. Be sure to store it in a cool, dry place when you\u2019re not using it to prevent bacteria growth, according to the brand.",

Dusting properly is crucial \u2014 it ensures you\u2019re actually lifting dust off surfaces and removing it from your home. Otherwise, you might just be moving dust around or putting it into the air.",
      "While you\u2019re cleaning, consider wearing a face mask so you don\u2019t inhale any of the dust particles that might make their way into the air, says Dr. Shradha Agarwal, an allergist and immunologist at Mount Sinai Health System\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine. Below, experts share tips for effective dusting.",
      "While you\u2019re cleaning higher areas, some particles fall onto surfaces beneath them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to dust from top to bottom \u2014 once you get to the lower areas, you can collect the dust that was there in the first place, plus any that made its way down during the cleaning process. Mock also recommends dusting first, then vacuuming. The vacuum can suck up any dirt and debris that got onto the floor while you were dusting.",
      "If you\u2019re dusting horizontally, make sure to clean in one direction (either right to left or left to right) instead of going back and forth. Doing so ensures you don\u2019t dirty already-clean areas, says Mock.",
      "People most often forget to dust hard-to-reach areas in their homes, says Mock. This includes ceiling fans, light fixtures, behind furniture, the tops of door frames and under appliances. Ignoring these spaces allows layers of dust to build up over time, eventually creating dust bunnies, which are small clumps of dust, lint, hair and other debris.",
      "Be sure to clean reusable dusters after every job, or trash used disposable dusters and swap them out for new ones. Even if your duster doesn\u2019t look dirty, it likely has microscopic dust particles on it that you can spread to other surfaces. Start every new clean with a fresh duster to avoid that.",
      "How to reduce dust in your home",
      "If your home is particularly dusty, spend some time identifying the root cause, says Hicks. Doing so can reduce how much and how fast dust builds up, making regular weekly maintenance easier. Here are some steps you can take to reduce dust and dust mites in your home.",
      "Regularly clean fabric and upholstered surfaces: Dust mites usually settle on bedding, upholstered furniture, curtains, drapes and carpeting, not hard surfaces like wood, says Agarwal. Cleaning these surfaces weekly helps remove and kill dust mites, and you can also put dust mite-impermeable covers on mattresses, box springs and pillows, she says. Additionally, try not to add a lot of additional fabric into your home from decor like accent pillows or stuffed animals, for example.Use an air purifier and/or dehumidifiers: Air purifiers with HEPA filters can help remove dust particles and other allergens like pollen, dander and pet hair from the air, while dehumidifiers can reduce condensation in homes. \u201cDust mites have decreased survival and multiplication when humidity is below 50% consistently,\u201d says Agarwal. Also be sure to repair any leaks in your home, as that could also contribute to the buildup of moisture.Keep your air conditioner and furnace filters clean: Furnace and air conditioner filters do an amazing job of preventing outdoor dirt and dust from entering your home, says Hicks. But if they\u2019re dirty, they\u2019re not as effective as they\u2019re designed to be. Be sure to clean or replace these filters on a regular schedule to ensure they\u2019re doing their jobs. Similarly, cleaning your air ducts to maintain healthy indoor air quality is also important, says Hicks. You should swap out the filter on your air purifier periodically, too.Close your windows: Open windows provide fresh air and a nice breeze, but they allow debris from the outdoors to flood inside your home, says Hicks. Dirt and pollen that come inside eventually settle on surfaces, which creates more dust and circulates in the air that you then breathe in.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Dust is a collection of particles including skin, fibers, hair, bacteria, soil, pollen and more, says Agarwal. And if you\u2019re in a particularly dusty area, you may experience symptoms like sneezing, coughing, itchy skin, watery eyes and even shortness of breath, she told us. However, feeling irritated by dust is different from having an allergy related to dust.",
      "\u201cWhen speaking in reference to allergies, we worry about dust mites,\u201d says Agarwal. \u201cDust mites are arthropods that are found in the dust of homes located in regions where they are prevalent. They cannot be seen with the naked eye and feed off of organic matter such as skin scales, and bacteria and require moisture for survival.\u201d",
      "Dust mites are not usually found in dry climates, which is why they\u2019re less prevalent in the western U.S. They thrive in warmer, wetter climates, and there are higher concentrations of dust mites in older homes prone to mold, homes with a lot of carpeting and homes that deal with other pests like roaches, according to Agarwal. Dust mite allergies can lead to inflammation inside the nose and asthma or eczema flare-ups, she says. So while dusting is important regardless of where you live, it\u2019s even more crucial if you live in an area where there are dust mites.",
      "You should dust surfaces in your home at least once a week, experts told us. However, dusting frequency depends on factors like the size of your home, the level of foot traffic and activity and the types of surfaces you\u2019ll be cleaning, says Mock. If you have pets, consider increasing the number of times you dust a week, especially during shedding seasons, says Hicks. Pet hair and dander contribute to dust buildup in homes, and more shedding means more dust.",
      "Additionally, if you live in an area where dust mites are prevalent, you should dust more frequently. Mock recommends dusting after home improvement projects or renovations as well, as they tend to create a lot of dust.",

      "Kercher\u2019s body was found in November 2007. She had been stabbed multiple times and had been sexually assaulted.",
      "Knox, then 20, was charged with murder, along with her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. Both Knox and Sollecito have always denied any involvement in the killing.",
      "Another man, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, was subsequently arrested in Germany and also charged with the murder after his bloody handprint was found on the scene, Dateline reported in 2007. Guede has maintained his innocence, as he reiterated in an interview in 2022.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Kercher had been killed during a dispute related to a sex game gone wrong, according to Dateline. Knox and Sollecito maintained their innocence, saying they had been spending time with each other the night Kercher died.",
      "Knox also faced slander charges for accusing her former boss, bar owner Patrick Lumumba, of participating in the murder.",
      "Lumumba was imprisoned for two weeks but was later found to be innocent. Knox claimed she implicated Lumumba under coercive interrogation by Italian police, according to the BBC.",
      "\u201cI never wanted to slander Patrick. He was my friend, he took care of me and consoled me for the loss of my friend. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to resist the pressure and that he suffered,\u201d she said in court in June 2024, the BBC reported.",
      "Lumumba later sued Knox for slander.",
      "What happened during the trials?",
      "Knox faced three trials for the murder and sexual assault of Kercher.",
      "In the initial trial, which spanned from January to December 2009, prosecutors alleged that Knox stabbed Kercher in the throat during a dispute, NBC News reported at the time.",
      "In his closing argument, lead prosecutor Giuliano Mignini claimed Knox tried to strangle Kercher. Prosecutors said a knife with Knox\u2019s DNA on the handle was found at Sollecito\u2019s house, while the defense argued that the knife in question did not match Kercher\u2019s stab wounds, according to NBC News.",
      "The prosecution also accused Knox and Sollecito of attempting to cover up the murder by staging a burglary, according to NBC News.",
      "In his closing argument, Mignini accused Knox of killing Kercher for personal reasons.",
      "\u201cAmanda had the chance to retaliate against a girl who was serious and quiet,\u201d he said, NBC News reported Mignini as saying. \u201cShe had harbored hatred for Meredith, and that was the time when it could explode. The time had come to take revenge on that smug girl.\u201d",
      "Knox wept in the courtroom as Mignini described Kercher\u2019s wounds during his closing argument, according to NBC News.",
      "In a statement to the court in April 2009 before the jury began deliberations, Knox maintained her innocence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid of being labelled as someone that I\u2019m not, as doing things I didn\u2019t do and having the killer\u2019s mask forced on me,\u201d she said, according to France 24.",
      "She also told the jury, \u201cIt is up to you now.\u201d",
      "Sollecito also denied having killed Kercher.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Meredith, and I wasn\u2019t in that house the night of the crime,\u201d he said, France 24 reported.",
      "At the end of the first trial, Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years.",
      "Guede, meanwhile, opted for a separate fast-track trial, and was found guilty of murder in October 2008. He was sentenced to 30 years behind bars, although his sentence was later reduced. He was ultimately released in 2021 after serving 13 years, according to the BBC.",
      "In a second trial in Italy in 2011, Knox and Sollecito appealed their initial convictions. They were both acquitted and freed, and Knox returned to the U.S. By that time, she had spent about four years in prison in Italy.",
      "Then, in 2013, Knox\u2019s acquittal was overturned by the Italian Court of Cassation, the equivalent of the Supreme Court, and she faced a retrial for Kercher\u2019s murder, according to NBC News.",
      "Knox vowed to remain in the U.S. as the retrial unfolded, saying at the time she was preparing herself for the \u201cworst-case scenario.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to prepare in my mind what that would be like. I thought about what it would be like to live my entire life in prison and to lose everything, to lose what I\u2019ve been able to come back to and rebuild,\u201d she told TODAY in September 2013. \u201cI think about it all the time. It\u2019s so scary. Everything\u2019s at stake.\u201d",
      "In 2014, Knox and Sollecito were convicted again of Kercher\u2019s murder. Knox remained in the U.S. and was sentenced in absentia to 28 \u00bd years in prison, while Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years.",
      "In 2015, Knox\u2019s and Sollecito\u2019s murder convictions were once again overturned by Italy\u2019s highest court in a retrial.",
      "Knox released a statement following her final exoneration.",
      "\u201cI am tremendously relieved and grateful for the decision of the Supreme Court of Italy,\u201d her statement read, in part, according to NBC News. \u201cThe knowledge of my innocence has given me strength in the darkest times of this ordeal.\u201d",
      "Knox spoke to the media in front of her parents\u2019 Seattle home on March 27, 2015, after her exoneration.",
      "However, her legal battles in Italy were not completely over. Even after her murder charges were overturned, the slander conviction she had received for wrongly implicating Lumumba in the killing remained on her record.",
      "In 2024, an Italian court reconvicted Knox of slander and sentenced her to three years in prison. She did not return to jail, however, as the new sentence counted as time already served, NBC News reported.",
      "\u201cThe irony is that while being wrongly convicted of slander, I\u2019m the most slandered person in this whole saga,\u201d Knox wrote on X in January 2025 after an Italian court upheld the slander conviction.",
      "\u201cThe police, prosecutor, media, courts, and the killer Rudy Guede, have all slandered me to no end,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Why was her conviction overturned?",
      "Knox and Sollecito\u2019s convictions were overturned due to \u201cglaring errors\u201d in the investigation of Kercher\u2019s murder, Italy\u2019s highest court said in 2015, according to NBC News.",
      "In a written opinion, the Italian court said no biological evidence of Knox or Sollecito had been found at the scene of the crime, while the third person convicted, Rudy Guede, had left \u201ccopious\u201d biological evidence.",
      "The court also accused police and prosecutors of \u201cstunning weakness\u201d and \u201cinvestigative bouts of amnesia,\u201d and accused authorities of bowing to public pressure to find \u201cone or more guilty parties to offer up to international public opinion.\u201d",
      "In the 2013 retrial, a forensic expert testified that the knife that had allegedly been used in the crime had no traces of Kercher\u2019s DNA on it.",
      "Experts also claimed that a material found on the blade of the knife in question was starch, not blood, according to NBC News.",
      "Forensic experts also testified that investigators may have contaminated pieces of evidence by using the same gloves to handle different items, and failed to properly document and analyze DNA evidence in the aftermath of the crime, NBC News reported.",
      "Where is she now?",
      "Today, Knox is a writer, public speaker and podcast host who advocates for wrongfully incarcerated people. She has opened up about her experiences in two memoirs, 2013\u2019s \u201cWaiting to Be Heard\u201d and 2025\u2019s\u201cFree: My Search for Meaning.\u201d",
      "Knox spoke at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books on April 26, 2025.",
      "Amanda Edwards / Getty Images",
      "She is also involved with multiple organizations fighting for criminal justice reform, including the Frederick Douglass Project for Justice and The Innocence Center, according to herofficial website.",
      "Knox has also hosted multiple podcasts about wrongful conviction, justice reform, and resilience, including \u201cLabyrinths\u201d and \u201cHard Knox.\u201d",
      "Knox married writer and podcast host Christopher Robinson in 2020.",
      "\u201cChris and I have been married now for as long as I was imprisoned, and together for as long as I was on trial,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post on Feb. 29, 2024, celebrating their fourth wedding anniversary.",
      "\u201cHe has balanced the scales of my life away from injustice and pain and towards love and hope,\u201d she continued. \u201cChoosing him as my person was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d",
      "In October 2021, Knox revealed that she and her husband had welcomed their first child, Eureka Muse Knox-Robinson, months earlier. She said she initially kept her daughter\u2019s birth private because she was \u201cstill nervous about the paparazzi bounty on her head,\u201d she told The New York Times.",
      "Knox and Robinson also welcomed a son, Echo, in September 2023.",
      "In 2019, the couple bought a home on Vashon Island near Seattle. Residents of the small island community were supportive of her and her family, starting a Facebook group called \u201cFriends of Amanda,\u201d Knox told the Mercer Island Reporter in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been nice being part of a small community as opposed to singled out under a harsh, international spotlight,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "ON TOP OF ONE of the highest observation points in New York City \u2014 800 feet and 70 floors into the sky, to be exact \u2014 Olandria Carthen leans against a ledge. Her ankles are crossed daintily, and an arm is draped over a railing. Behind her is a sprawling aerial view of Midtown, skyscrapers kissing the clouds; the Empire State Building peeks just over her left shoulder.",
      "Nic Vansteenberghe is two feet in front of her, iPhone in hand, snapping away. He shows her his camerawork before they reposition to take another photo. They\u2019ve already posed for several selfies together \u2014 but this type of view, on the breathtaking terrace on Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center, is the type you want to savor. A thousand photos could not be enough.",
      "The two are with some of their fellow \u201cLove Island USA\u201d cast mates, who are also scattered around the deck for their TODAY.com photo shoot. After a blockbuster Season 7, this group found themselves on top of the world this summer \u2014 and right now, on this balmy August day, they quite literally are. And for a rare moment, they are collectively stopping to take in the view.",
      "Nic and Olandria are runners-up of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 7. Along with winners Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales, couple Taylor Williams and Clarke Carraway, and Chelley Bissainthe, they had just come from the 30 Rock Plaza for their appearance on TODAY, less than 48 hours after filming the \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 7 reunion, which drops Aug. 25 on Peacock.",
      "This group spent more than a month isolated in a villa in Fiji for the show. After it wrapped in July, they returned to hundreds of thousands of new followers and the news that Season 7 was Peacock\u2019s most watched original series. It feels like they haven\u2019t had a break. On that, they can agree.",
      "\u201cMaybe 5, 10 minutes,\u201d Nic clarifies.",
      "As the reporter for this story, I don\u2019t want to interrupt the crew from their tourist-like fun. But when the time comes, I finally approach: \u201cHey, could I pull you two for a quick interview?\u201d",
      "I chicken out of using the signature \u201cLove Island\u201d verbiage \u2014 \u201cCan I pull you for a chat?\u201d \u2014 but in essence, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And I\u2019m here to tell you it\u2019s much more intimidating than it looks on TV.",
      "LET\u2019S CUT RIGHT TO the question on the minds of most \u201cLove Island USA\u201d fans ahead of the Season 7 reunion: Which couples are still together now?",
      "Winners Amaya and Bryan recently hit a major milestone: Amaya, a native New Yorker, took on Bryan\u2019s hometown of Boston. Together, they threw out the first pitch at a Red Sox game on Aug. 4.",
      "\u201cI had such a great time, met his mom \u2014 it was just very wholesome,\u201d Amaya says of their trip.",
      "For the camera, they share a sweet kiss, Amaya leaning in and grazing her beau\u2019s chin. But even after posing for photos, Bryan\u2019s arm drapes around Amaya\u2019s shoulder as she tucks into his side. It\u2019s a physical representation of what they mean to each other as they experience the kind of seemingly overnight fame that comes from leaving the villa a \u201cLove Island\u201d winner.",
      "\u201cNobody really knows what we experience except for us. So we always fall back on each other whenever we\u2019re feeling overwhelmed,\u201d Bryan says.",
      "\u201cHe always makes it a priority to make sure that we\u2019re both OK,\u201d Amaya adds.",
      "Nic and Olandria have also been traveling. The pair embarked on a \u201cbaecation\u201d (Nic\u2019s words) to Greece, where they photographed  a \u201cLove Island\u201d-themed line for Kulani Kinis, an Australian swimwear brand Nic has been modeling with for years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Europe before, so I was very grateful to go, especially with a guy like this,\u201d Olandria says.",
      "\u201cThat was where the 10-minute break came in,\u201d Nic adds.",
      "During our morning at 30 Rock, it was rare to spot Nic without Olandria, and vice versa. Walking through the halls near Studio 1A, they tightly held hands.",
      "Clarke seemed glued to Taylor\u2019s side. When I grab them for an interview on the rooftop, voice recorder in hand, she naturally leans against his shoulder as he holds her close. Back in July, they told me they were excited to introduce each other to their respective lifestyles \u2014 Clarke in the city and Taylor in the country.",
      "Now, Clarke says her favorite memory from the past month was riding in the opening of a rodeo in Oklahoma alongside her beau.",
      "\u201cBefore they start the events at the rodeo, everybody comes out on their horses,\u201d she explains, showcasing her firsthand knowledge of Taylor\u2019s sport. \u201cNormally he does that by himself, but I wanted to do it, too. We did it together.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was getting scared, though,\u201d Taylor adds.",
      "\u201cI was. But then, I mean, I rode a horse by myself \u2014 with no saddle,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "And Chelley?",
      "\u201cI love my man,\u201d she says simply after showing me her iPhone lock screen: a professional, loved-up photo of her and Ace.",
      "As individuals, though, the personalities that fans have grown to know and love also shine off-camera. As soon as she arrives at Top of the Rock\u2019s terrace, Amaya finds the free-use binoculars. She fiddles with the machine before stepping up on a circular ledge for a better view, and her heels dangle from the few inches of extra height as she takes in her hometown. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s having a moment, and when she catches me and a few others watching, her surprise shifts to laughter and a wide, open smile.",
      "Throughout Season 7, Amaya \u2014 who entered the show as a bombshell in Episode 4 \u2014 quickly became a fan-favorite, known for hyping herself up through impromptu songs and memorable mantras. A fan favorite: \u201cI feel free! I feel like I could fly! Like the pigeons back in New York City!\u201d",
      "For their first group portrait for this TODAY.com photo shoot, the \u201cLove Island USA\u201d vets are presented with a challenge. (No, it doesn\u2019t involve kissing.) The seven cast members are invited onto Top of the Rock\u2019s beam experience, which allows visitors to re-create that famous \u201cLunch Atop a Skyscraper\u201d photo from the 1930s. The photographer and crews get each of them positioned on a steel beam, buckled up side by side, and then they rise 10 feet into the air, the full scope of Central Park visible behind them."

      "Morgan Cadenhead accumulated 150,000 TikTok followers in just 10 days as a result of her nontraditional sorority rush style. Now she's waiting to see her story play out on Lifetime's new reality show, \"A Sorority Mom's Guide to Rush!\"",
      "\"Rush is like 'The Hunger Games' for college girls,\" Morgan says in a video interview with TODAY.com.",
      "Responding to the negative attention some of her videos attracted, she adds, \"I know how things go for me personally on TikTok. So I'm just really nervous about people taking portions of it to suit other needs.\"",
      "Morgan's mom, Lori Cadenhead, is right by Morgan's side in the interview, just as she is on the reality show, which follows Morgan's journey through the 2024 rush process at the University of Alabama. Morgan rushed for a second time in 2024 because she did not receive a bid in 2023.",
      "\"My mom was like, 'You should rush! That'd be so cool if you got in. And then we could do all the parent events and stuff,'\" Morgan says.",
      "Lori, who learned about sorority life through HBO's 2023 documentary \u201cBama Rush,\u201d says, \"I kind of felt like I pushed her a little bit because in the beginning, she really wasn't gonna rush. And then I kept on bringing up the fact that these are your friends for life. I just wanted her to be part of something.\"",
      "Sorority rush season at the University of Alabama \u2014 Bama Rush for short \u2014 requires a whole new vocabulary with terms like PNMs (potential new members), OOTDs (outfits of the day) and RushTok (the corner of TikTok dedicated to videos about sorority rush week). Well-versed in RushTok, Morgan even posts an OOTD video for this very interview.",
      "In the episode airing on Sept. 1, viewers watch as Morgan gets dropped from rush the second year in a row ... but she certainly grows throughout the process.",
      "\u201cI was really sad because I put a lot into it,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cBut at the same time, it was a relief, because in order to be in a sorority, I would have had to do a complete 180. I don\u2019t know if I would have been 100% myself.\u201d",
      "In a video she posted on Bid Day 2024 that has 1.5 million views, Morgan said, \u201cTo everyone who was dropped or withdrew from recruitment, please remember this: We\u2019re all a part of a much larger sisterhood, one that\u2019s not defined by Greek letters.\"",
      "She also gave a special shoutout to her mom, who traveled from Florida to Tuscaloosa to support her daughter during rush week.",
      "Rush: Take Two",
      "When Morgan first began posting rush videos on TikTok in 2023, she stood out from other PNMs. She gained notoriety for chugging orange juice, dressing differently than other PNMs and perhaps not taking rush \"seriously\" enough.",
      "\"Rushing was a thing that you did, in a sense,\" Morgan explains of her first rush experience. \"It's a great way to meet your classmates before class starts. Is a great way to get connected with the other girls. It is a really nice bonding experience for a lot of the freshmen. So that's kind of why I did it.\"",
      "\"The second time I did it, it was largely because I'd seen what it was about, what they were doing, how they treated each other, how they acted, and I really wanted to be part of it,\" she says. \"I wanted it the second time more than I did the first, I think. I thought that if I gave it a real try, and was a little bit more sorority girl-ish, then maybe I would get in.\"",
      "Lori adds, \"I think there also might have been a little bit of a 'You guys didn't think I was good enough, but I promise I can do this.'\"",
      "Dealing With Negativity",
      "It can be hard for Lori to sit back and watch negative comments appear on Morgan's posts.",
      "\"it sucks. It really does,\" Lori says. \"Especially the last month when Morgan started talking about rush again, I feel like they're coming for her. The comments are just not 'sorority girl sisterhood' comments. Let's just put it that way.\"",
      "The ladies suspect that many of the most negative comments are coming from students on campus. \"They're making fake accounts quicker than their little fingers can type,\" Lori says.",
      "Luckily, however, she notes that her daughter has \"a pretty thick skin.\"",
      "Laughing, Morgan adds, \"I think that it bothers her more than it bothers me personally. I don't mind.\"",
      "In fact, Morgan would absolutely advise an incoming freshman to give Bama Rush a whirl.",
      "\"I'm not not self-aware enough to realize that my experience is one of one,\" she says. \"It was an interesting combination of social media and the way I acted that got me the results that I got. A normal freshman going through this process is not going to have to deal with anything that I've had to deal with.\"",
      "Life After Sorority Rush",
      "Morgan, who will be graduating from college in December, has found her people outside of sororities.",
      "\"I was part of book club. I tried fencing ... wasn't for me,\" she says, pausing for a laugh. \"I mostly just hang out on campus with my friends.\" She will also grab coffee with people who reach out to her via social media. \"One of my closest friends I met that way the first year that I rushed,\" she adds.",
      "Morgan is also funneling her creativity into writing a book. Spoiler alert: It's not about rush.",
      "\"It's a dystopian young adult book and the tagline is, 'What if every 10 years the government made you wipe your memory?'\" she says proudly.",
      "Morgan says she would consider writing about her rush experience, but, she says, \"I'd have to leave school before we ever touch that.\"",
      "Even with all of the ups and downs of rush, Morgan says she wouldn't change a thing.",
      "Her mother, however, would.",

      "BEIJING \u2014 They aren\u2019t the most graceful athletes, or the fastest. But they\u2019re learning.",
      "From Friday to Sunday, human handlers from 16 countries put about 500 bipedal robots through various motions to showcase the promise and limits of embodied artificial intelligence at what was billed as the first World Humanoid Robot Games in Beijing.",
      "The robotic participants came in all shapes, sizes and structures and competed in 26 different sports events, from running to kickboxing to soccer. The unusual state-backed sports tournament at the National Speed Skating Oval, a Beijing Olympic venue, came as the United States and China race each other to shape the future of AI.",
      "No speed records were being set, and many of the athletes were prone to fizzling and face plants. Some robots broke down unexpectedly while they were competing, while others didn\u2019t complete their tasks as planned. A viral video showed a running robot veering off course and accidentally knocking over a person on the track.",
      "But for the robots\u2019 developers, the games were less about winning or losing and more about testing their agility, endurance and battery life, all of which have made great advances in recent years.",
      "Some humanoids were also competing in more practical job skills, such as sorting medicine and hotel concierge duties.",
      "A team from StarBot, a California-based tech company that specializes in developing robots skilled in customer service, said they were \u201creally excited\u201d to be part of the games.",
      "\u201cWe thought it was a really good opportunity to come to China and be in an environment where everything is so modern and up to date,\u201d company representative Gregorio Velasco told NBC News.",
      "StarBot\u2019s machines, developed based on the Chinese-made Unitree model, competed in service-related races, as they excel at restaurant scenarios such as taking orders and delivering food to tables, he said.",
      "Going forward, Velasco said, \u201cwe hope to be in people\u2019s homes and restaurants, hotels, and I think in the future, many people will have robots involved in their life.\u201d",
      "The venue was packed with spectators who laughed, clapped and rooted for the robot athletes as the games kicked off Friday.",
      "During the tai chi event, a group of judges watched carefully as the robot competitors moved gracefully to the rhythm of soft music in the background, jotting down notes and scoring the performances with the seriousness of an Olympic panel.",
      "\u201cFor robots, a single movement needs to be repeated many times before they can perform it with stability,\u201d martial arts judge Zhang Jidong told Chinese state newspaper The Beijing News. \u201cConsidering the very short preparation time, the robots\u2019 upper-body movements were impressively smooth.\u201d",
      "The games didn\u2019t just showcase how far robotics have come and how humanoids might one day be integrated into daily life. They also revealed how heavily China\u2019s government has been backing the development of such technologies, to close the artificial intelligence gap with the United States.",
      "In July, China announced its global action plan for AI just days after the Trump administration released the U.S. version, which experts note is \u201cno coincidence\u201d as the two countries race to win others over to their respective visions for AI governance. Both countries consider AI a national security issue, and the United States has sought to restrict China\u2019s access to the advanced semiconductor chips needed to train AI models.",
      "While the United States backs market-driven AI in alignment with liberal norms, China promises to help developing countries with AI as a means to promote state control, according to the Atlantic Council, a think tank based in Washington.",
      "Videos of robots dancing, punching and performing have been all over Chinese social media and state TV as Beijing has deepened its AI investment and promotion. In April, the Chinese government organized a half-marathon in Beijing in which robots and human runners raced one another.",
      "For years, Beijing has been funneling tens of billions of dollars into AI research and state subsidies, just as it did with the electric vehicle industry, drawing accusations of unfair competition from Western critics.",
      "While American robot developers such as Boston Dynamics still dominate high-end research and innovation, Chinese companies, spurred by government policy, are focused on mass-producing affordable robots, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank based in Washington.",
      "Research published by Morgan Stanley predicts that by 2050, China will have 302.3 million humanoid robots in use, well ahead of the U.S. projection of just 77.7 million.",
      "Although the production disparity between the two countries may grow larger, experts said the United States will maintain its advantage in total compute capacity, a metric more likely to be the key in deploying and integrating AI systems at scale.",
      "Wang Xiaoyin, a representative from the China-based robot developer NexAurora, said robots today still lack a \u201crobust AI brain.\u201d",
      "The \u201creal AI age,\u201d he said, will begin only when robots like the ones competing in Beijing can think and behave independently after training.",
      "While the robots\u2019 performance over the weekend showed that day is still a long way off, the games were part of China\u2019s larger goal: getting ahead in the global race for AI domination, one clunky step at a time.",

      "Known as minidramas, micro dramas or vertical dramas, they are soap operas condensed into a minute or two per episode.",
      "Each show, reminiscent of a telenovela, is divided into dozens of chapters, each about two minutes long and with all the soapy elements: cheesy romance, over-the-top drama and abundant cliff-hangers.",
      "\u201cThe revenge ones, oh, my God, they\u2019re so good,\u201d California-based retail business owner Jacarius Murphy told NBC News in a video interview.",
      "Murphy is a fan of the minidramas, known as duanju in Chinese, which focus heavily on romance, revenge and fantasy. The stories tend to involve wealthy characters such as a chief executive who\u2019s secretly a vampire or a billionaire living a double life \u2014 characters often played by American actors.",
      "\u201cPeople want this fast dopamine hit, and they can snack on it while they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Anina Net, an American actor based in Los Angeles who has worked on minidramas for the past four years.",
      "The genre originated in China, where production companies have tapped into the popularity of short-form, vertical-produced, TikTok-style video content. About half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people consume dramas in this style, according to a report released in March by the state-owned China Netcasting Services Association.",
      "The industry made $6.9 billion in revenue last year, more than China\u2019s total box office sales.",
      "The shows are \u201cstill quite limited in genre, mostly romance-focused, with sweet, domineering CEO tropes and modern settings,\u201d said Kaidi Dai, a Shanghai-based minidrama producer.",
      "Now, having figured out the Chinese market, the same companies are expanding into the U.S., where minidramas are finding success just a few years after the failure of Quibi, a short-lived, short-form mobile streaming service. The shows are available on platforms such as ReelShort, DramaBox and GoodShort, which offers free episodes and in-app purchases, as well as subscriptions.",
      "Minidramas cost far less to make than standard TV shows and can make millions of dollars in revenue through a combination of user purchases and advertising. But adapting them to the U.S. market takes some tweaking, said Chinese filmmaker Gao Feng, also known as Frank Tian, who has a minidrama production company based in New York.",
      "Rather than remaking Chinese shows, his company hired longtime U.S. residents to craft stories that would appeal to American audiences.",
      "\u201cI believe that scripts determine 65-70% of a project\u2019s success,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cApart from werewolves, CEO romances and hidden identities, we should explore new genres.\u201d",
      "While many short dramas have been based on successful Chinese stories, \u201cif a platform cannot innovate continuously, it will face significant challenges,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the most popular shows is \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,\u201d which tells the story of a woman whose husband is better off financially than he appears. All 60 episodes can be viewed in less than 70 minutes on ReelShort, the California-based, Chinese-backed minidrama platform that released it in 2023.",

      "The Chinese-backed short-video app has vied with TikTok as the most popular product in the entertainment section of Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "\u201cThe short videos on TikTok have laid a solid foundation for the popularity of short dramas,\u201d Yan Min, who helped organize an industry conference in China last year, said in an interview.",
      "Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the \u201cevolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.\u201d",
      "U.S. entertainment companies have taken notice of the trend. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program.",
      "Though minidramas seeking U.S. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.",
      "\u201cWe seek actors and screenwriters who grew up in the U.S. and naturally embody an American style. Then we incorporate some Chinese elements,\u201d said Ann An, a Beijing-based freelance producer for several minidramas made for foreign audiences.",
      "Turnarounds are incredibly fast in the industry as producers strive to keep costs low. An said a show can finish filming in 10 days, with a budget of under $70,000.",
      "The biggest key to the success of minidramas, though, is the cliff-hangers, which push viewers to keep paying for the next episode.",
      "\u201cThe scriptwriters know exactly where to place these cliff-hangers, and they execute them very well,\u201d said Apple Yang, a minidrama director based in London.",
      "That helps explain the appeal of minidramas even if their overall quality is sometimes \u201cunderwhelming,\u201d said Ying Zhu, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "\u201cMake the dialogue real and less mechanic. Make it funny when possible and biting when needed,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cOne minute can pack in a lot of info if done well.\u201d"

The gathering marked the first time in decades that such a broad delegation of allies had assembled at the White House under such pressing circumstances.",
      "Shortly after noon, one by one, the heads of state and NATO partners passed the White House gates, where they were met by President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of protocol, and in Zelenskyy\u2019s case, by Trump himself.",

They were there to bolster Zelenskyy after a disastrous White House visit in February, when he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 and after Trump held a nearly three-hour one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.",
      "The show of support for Zelenskyy involved French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who pivoted from their own national agendas to present a united front as Trump seeks an urgent end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",

They included meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev amid a key question over whether Germany would join NATO. And in 1950, the British prime minister rushed to Washington to consult Harry Truman over fears of the possible use of nuclear weapons during the Korean War.",

But it was the speed with which this came together that was so striking and sets this apart,\u201d said Marc Selverstone, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center of Public Affairs. \u201cEveryone realized this was a crisis moment.\u201d",

At another point, Trump deflected a question to Zelenskyy about Ukraine\u2019s elections to joke about serving a third term himself.",

Another image posted by the White House showed Trump seated behind his historic desk, this time with Vance and Rubio before him, the phone handset resting on the desk as he talked with Putin.",

      "Minutes after emerging from a four-hour meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several other European leaders at the White House on Monday, Stubb described the results to NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhat we have agreed on is to work on European and American security guarantees, essentially, which will be secure from the European perspective, coordinated with the Americans,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s us who decide what kind of security guarantees we put up for Ukraine, not the Russians.\u201d",

      "For Stubb, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is personal. Both his father and grandfather were born in cities that were ceded to Russia following Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s 1939 invasion of Finland and that remain part of Russia today. That history informs his commitment to Ukraine. Until Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Finland, which shares more than 800 miles of border with Russia, had remained steadfastly neutral for decades, including during the Cold War.",
      "Stubb described his country as a regional \u201csecurity provider,\u201d pointing to its mandatory military service, large reserve forces and arsenal of weapons. \u201cWe have over 60 F-18s. We just bought 64 F-35s. We have long-range missiles, air, land and sea, and we have the largest artillery in Europe, together with Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "Finland and other European countries represented at the White House on Monday \u2014 Britain, France, Germany and Italy, as well as the heads of the European Commission and NATO \u2014 are part of a group known as the Coalition of the Willing, which also met virtually on Tuesday. Stubb said they have been working on how to help secure Ukraine for some time, and decided at the White House meeting to order their militaries and civil servants to come up with a plan as soon as next week.",
      "A location for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not yet been determined, but Stubb suggested Switzerland as a possibility. \u201cGeneva could work actually,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be neutral territory for it.\u201d",
      "Stubb said the goal is for the meeting to happen as soon as possible, hopefully \u201cwithin the next two weeks.\u201d",
      "Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, said Tuesday morning that the country would grant Putin immunity to enter the country for such a meeting, despite an arrest warrant for him for war crimes by the International Criminal Court of Justice. Putin would be at risk of arrest in most other countries in Europe, among a total of 125 nations that observe the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction. The U.S. does not.",

      "According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked Stubb over lunch if he could trust Putin, and Stubb told him \u201cyou cannot.\u201d Hours later, the Journal noted, Trump publicly criticized Putin for the first time over his refusal to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine.",
      "The Journal also reported on informal calls and texts between the two leaders since then, including Trump sometimes consulting Stubb before speaking with Putin.

      "\u201cWhen I look at the situation and the facts, I don\u2019t see President Putin very willing to get peace now,\u201d Macron told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview Monday after a high-stakes White House meeting. \u201cBut perhaps I\u2019m too pessimistic.\u201d",

      "If there is no progress in the bilateral meeting President Donald Trump announced between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and if a trilateral meeting falls through, \u201cor if the Russians don\u2019t comply with this approach, yes, we have to increase the sanctions, secondary and primary sanctions,\u201d Macron said.",

      "\u201cIf you make any peace deal without security guarantees, Russia will never respect its words, will never comply with its own commitments,\u201d Macron said.",
      "He said it was promising that Trump noted that one of the key points from his meeting Friday with Putin was that he had accepted security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, Macron said, \u201cI do hope,\u201d noting that Russia carried out strikes in Ukraine even as the delegation of world leaders was in the United States.",

      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Ukraine is extremely important for Ukrainian people, obviously, but for the whole security of Europe, because we speak about containing a nuclear power, which decided just not to respect international borders anymore. And I think it\u2019s very important for your country, because it\u2019s a matter of credibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we will behave in Ukraine will be a test for our collective credibility in the rest of the world.\u201d"

      "Trump revealed the next steps in his attempt to broker a peace deal on Truth Social after a full afternoon of meetings at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders who are eager to see Ukraine safeguarded from future Russian aggression.",
      "When the talks ended, Trump wrote, he called Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the arrangements. He spoke to Putin for about 40 minutes in the Oval Office without the European leaders present.",
      "\"Everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Trump's report comes amid a rapid-fire effort on his part to end a conflict that began more than three years ago with Russia's invasion of its smaller democratic neighbor.",
      "He flew to Alaska on Friday for a face-to-face meeting with Putin and then hastened to invite Zelenskyy and the European leaders to the White House on Monday to make more progress.",
      "The gathering that Trump hosted was an extraordinary spectacle in its own right, carrying echoes of the Second World War. On one day, under one roof, Western leaders assembled in hopes of ending a conflict between a vulnerable European democracy and a bigger dictatorship bent on gobbling up more territory.",
      "Trump met with Zelenskyy at the White House for about an hour in an accelerated effort to end the war on terms acceptable to both sides. The pair then met with European leaders to work toward a breakthrough in a conflict that Trump himself has cautioned could erupt in a third world war if it were allowed to persist.",
      "Trump greeted Zelenskyy in the early afternoon with a smile and a warm handshake \u2014 a stark difference from the tense televised meeting the two men held in February in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump took note of Zelenskyy's more decorous look. Ditching his traditional wartime garb, he wore a dark, formal jacket with a collar.",
      "\"The best I had,\" Zelenskyy told him.",
      "\"I love it!\" Trump said.",
      "Fresh off his summit with Putin, Trump sat down with Zelenskyy to see whether they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine's future security and the status of territory the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that their private meeting in the Oval Office went well. \u201cWe had a very good conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the best one.\u201d",
      "Asked whether U.S. troops would help secure a peace deal, Trump did not rule out the possibility.",
      "As a condition of ending the war, Putin has insisted that his country retain about 20% of Ukrainian territory that it now controls. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine's constitution forbids him to cede any land.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy spoke to the news media in the Oval Office before they went behind closed doors. Trump suggested he will not abandon efforts to forge a peace deal, though he conceded the Russia-Ukraine conflict has proved particularly stubborn.",
      "\"It's never the end of the road,\" Trump said. \"People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So I would say it's not the end of the road. I think we have a good chance of doing it.\"",
      "When a reporter asked whether he was prepared redraw Ukraine's map if it would end the war sooner, Zelenskyy did not answer directly.",
      "\"We need to stop this war,\" he said. \"To stop Russia, we need support from American and from European partners.\"",
      "Upon finishing the meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy went straight to another meeting with the European leaders: French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "\"We will come to a resolution today I think on almost everything, including probably the security,\" Trump said before the start of that meeting.",
      "After they finished the talks, Trump and the European leaders moved into the Oval Office for further discussions, according to a White House official.",
      "Europe looms large in any accord between the combatants. Looking to prevent future Russian attacks, European nations would be an important part of any security guarantees that Ukraine has requested as part of any peace deal.",
      "But the United States also may play a part, Trump said \u2014 a surprising admission from the \"America First\" president. If there is a Trump foreign policy doctrine, it is that he wants to extricate the United States from foreign wars and shift some of the peacekeeping burden from the United States to other countries.",
      "Yet when he was asked whether he would deploy Americans to Ukraine to help preserve a peace deal, Trump did not dismiss the idea out of hand.",
      "\"We're going to work with Ukraine, we're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there is peace, the peace is going to stay long-term,\" he said.",
      "With the TV cameras present, the tone was far more cordial than in Zelenskyy's last visit. In that February meeting, Vice President JD Vance sat beside Trump and berated Zelenskyy for not showing enough gratitude to Trump. This time, Vance sat in the same place but stayed silent.",
      "In the last visit, Trump memorably told Zelenskyy that he didn't hold any \"cards\" and that his country was \"in big trouble.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that\u2019s backed you,\u201d he told Zelenskyy at the time.",
      "The meeting was ultimately cut short.",
      "Who holds the better \"cards\" at this point? a reporter asked Trump on Monday.",
      "\"I don't want to say that,\" he replied.",
      "Trump has lately stepped up his role in ending the conflict. With an eye on the Nobel Peace Prize, he met privately with Putin at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday to jump-start peace talks. He and Putin strode down a red carpet together before a private meeting that lasted nearly three hours.",
      "Though he said beforehand that  he wanted a ceasefire, Trump left the summit without one and said he was shifting his aim, instead, toward a full-fledged \"peace agreement.\"",
      "The Trump administration's messaging has at times been muddled. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a ceasefire was \u201cnot off the table.\"",
      "Rubio said in the interview that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. Later in the day, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "Sunday night on Truth Social, Trump seemed to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, as opposed to Putin, who sent tanks rolling into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Trump wrote that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and also abandon any hope of joining NATO \u2014 one of Putin's demands.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy took a different stance. He wrote late Sunday on X that \u201cRussia must end this war, which it itself started.\u201d",
      "The meetings Monday give the leaders a forum to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hopes to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5's all-for-one provision, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be a treaty-level obligation, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A challenge for Zelenskyy is to persuade Trump that Russia should give up the territory it seized by force. A European official said it was their belief that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls.",
      "In the run-up to the Alaska summit, Trump said an end to the war would include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy promptly shot down the prospect, saying, \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d"

      "For Kyiv, the Donbas is a vital industrial hub and defensive buffer, a resource-rich region that Ukraine fiercely claims as its sovereign territory with deep cultural roots.",
      "For the Kremlin, it is both a tactical target and a political lever, with Putin framing the region as historically linked to Russia while placing it at the heart of the territorial ambitions he has pursued with military force.",
      "Its fate may now be decided in the Oval Office rather than on the battlefield.",
      "What is the Donbas?",
      "Made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Donbas is an industrial powerhouse spanning roughly 20,000 square miles, making it roughly the size of West Virginia. It is rich in coal and metal deposits, and shaped by industrial towns and strategically important ports on the Sea of Azov.",
      "After Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow-backed separatists fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, a conflict that lasted eight years and killed an estimated 14,000 people, according to the United Nations.",

      "European leaders announced that they would join Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday as they seek to navigate America\u2019s new approach to ending the war after Trump signaled that he was reversing his insistence on a ceasefire and instead pursuing a permanent peace deal \u2014 seemingly aligning the United States with the Kremlin.",
      "Trump on Sunday appeared to respond to reports that he may also be backing Putin\u2019s demands for Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region, a further source of alarm among Kyiv and its European backers.",
      "\u201cIf I got Russia to give up Moscow as part of the Deal, the Fake News, and their PARTNER, the Radical Left Democrats, would say I made a terrible mistake and a very bad deal,\u201d he posted on Truth Social.",
      "As Ukraine and Europe work out how best to move forward, a slew of leaders on the continent announced that they would be joining Zelenskyy in Washington. They will perhaps hope to ensure there is no repeat of his last Oval Office meeting, and to prevent Zelenskyy standing alone to face any pressure to accede to Putin\u2019s demands.",
      "The offices of NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von de Leyen, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said they would travel to Washington on Monday to meet with Trump. They will be joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, according to Reuters.",
      "\u201cThe trip will serve as an exchange of information\u201d with Trump, Merz\u2019s office said. \u201cThe talks will address, among other things, security guarantees, territorial issues, and continued support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the European Union for its support on Sunday, standing alongside von de Leyen in Brussels, where he is set to attend a virtual meeting of the so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing,\u201d which includes more than 30 countries working together to support Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWashington is with us,\u201d he said, while reiterating that a ceasefire was needed to work on a final deal.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d  Sunday that a temporary ceasefire agreement is \u201cnot off the table,\u201d despite Trump\u2019s comments a day earlier.",
      "Any deal would have to include \u201csome security guarantees for Ukraine,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "Special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, meanwhile, said that Putin had agreed in Alaska to allow U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security guarantees resembling NATO\u2019s collective defense mandate as part of an eventual peace deal.",
      "\u201cWe were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\u201d Witkoff said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d",
      "Witkoff appeared to suggest that Russia had also agreed to \u201clegislative enshrinement\u201d promising \u201cnot to go after any other territory when the peace deal is codified.\u201d",
      "Trump did appear to have taken a step toward the wishes of Ukraine and Europe on that subject in recent days.",
      "Trump directly engaged with Zelenskyy and European leaders by phone early Saturday morning about the U.S. taking part in a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine as part of a deal with Russia, two senior administration officials and three sources familiar with the discussions told NBC News.",
      "\u201cEuropean and American security guarantees were discussed,\u201d one source familiar with the discussions said. \u201cU.S. troops on the ground was not discussed or entertained by [Trump].\u201d",
      "The security guarantees would be made in the scenario that Russia were to invade Ukraine again after a would-be peace deal, the sources said. The sources said that those protections, as discussed by the White House, would not include NATO membership \u2014 despite European leaders saying in a joint statement Saturday that Ukraine should be given the right to seek NATO membership.",
      "But it was clear that the summit had left Ukraine feeling uneasy.",
      "For civilians on the ground, still under Russian attack even as the diplomatic maneuvering played out, it was not just the substance but the optics of the Alaska talks that caused frustration.",
      "\u201cI was hoping that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t roll out the red carpet to the enemy,\u201d Kyiv resident Natalya Lypei said Saturday. \u201cHow can you welcome a tyrant like this?\u201d"

      "Those demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014, although Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region.",
