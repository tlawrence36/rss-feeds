      "LONDON -- A new album called \u201cIs This What We Want?\u201d features a stellar list of more than 1,000 musicians \u2014 and the sound of silence.",
      "With contributions from artists including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Cat Stevens and Damon Albarn, the album was released Tuesday to protest proposed British changes to artificial intelligence laws that artists fear will erode their creative control.",
      "The U.K. government is consulting on whether to let tech firms use copyrighted material to help train AI models unless the creators explicitly opt out.",
      "Critics of the idea fear that will make it harder for artists to retain control of their work and will undermine Britain\u2019s creative industries. Elton John and Paul McCartney are among those who have spoken out against the plan.",
      "The protest album features recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, to show what they fear will be the fate of creative venues if the plan goes through. The titles of the 12 tracks spell out: \u201cThe British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.\u201d",
      "Profits will be donated to the musicians\u2019 charity Help Musicians.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s proposal would hand the life\u2019s work of the country\u2019s musicians to AI companies, for free, letting those companies exploit musicians\u2019 work to outcompete them,\u201d said composer and AI developer Ed Newton-Rex, who organized the album.",
      "\u201cIt is a plan that would not only be disastrous for musicians, but that is totally unnecessary,\u201d Newton-Rex said. \u201cThe U.K. can be leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s center-left Labour Party government says it wants to make the U.K. a world leader in AI. In December, it announced a consultation into how copyright law can \u201cenable creators and right holders to exercise control over, and seek remuneration for, the use of their works for AI training\u201d while also ensuring \u201cAI developers have easy access to a broad range of high-quality creative content.\u201d The consultation closes on Tuesday.",
      "Publishers, artists\u2019 organizations and media companies, including The Associated Press, have banded together as the Creative Rights in AI Coalition to oppose weakening copyright protections.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- As the cast of \"Conclave\" descended steps leading to backstage at the Shrine Auditorium, they got a fresh round of applause from staff and crew at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to go with the big ovation they'd gotten moments earlier from the ballroom crowd.",
      "The esteemed group of Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow had enough collective gravitas on their own, but Harrison Ford, who had just presented them the best ensemble award, the night's big prize, also walked among them.",
      "He was among the generations of stars, including the night's other big winners and nominees, to congratulate the elite performers from the papal potboiler as they made their way through the behind-the-scenes winners' obligations at the SAG Awards, with an Associated Press reporter in tow.",
      "A photographer asked the \u201cConclave\u201d winners to stop and pose, and shouted \u201cGet in there Mr. Ford!\u201d",
      "Ford, not wanting to horn in, walked backwards up the steps back on to the stage.",
      "SAG staffers tried to lead the group to their next stop, but they had to wait. \u201cI have to go get my purse!\u201d Rossellini said, and returned to the ballroom. Lithgow went back in too to get his wife.",
      "A gleeful Jamie Lee Curtis descended on the two before they left and gave congrats and kisses to each.",
      "Fiennes walked ahead alone for a moment, and happened on Ariana Grande, whose cast of \u201cWicked\u201d had been up against \u201cConclave\u201d for best ensemble.",
      "'Yay, congratulations!\" she told Fiennes. \u201cI was really happy for you guys I was screaming!\"",

      "Next came a station, normally a bar, where the actual SAG statuettes are handed out. (The ones they accept on stage are just props.)",

      "\u201cYou nailed it,\u201d he said, adding that she expressed \u201cwhat no one is saying.\u201d",
      "Rossellini reappeared, gave a big hug to Fonda, and introduced her to the fourth \u201cConclave\u201d cast member in attendance, Sergio Castellitto, who played the vaping Cardinal Tedesco in the film.",

      "The wins for \u201cConclave\u201d and Chalamet threw a wrench into expectations for the Oscars that are just a week away, with Chalamet, Fiennes and Rossellini all nominees. The presumed Oscar frontrunner, \u201cAnora,\u201d was shut out.",
      "Lithgow returned to the group, and when Chalamet saw him he shouted, \u201cHey John, not bad eh?\"",

      "\u201cI don't want to boast, but..,\u201d he said with a shrug to the AP reporter.",
      "The group moved along and signed show posters, then made their way to the area where winners pose for press photos.",
      "Actors always say awards are heavy when they get them, but by all accounts the SAG statue truly is. Kieran Culkin made the heft the subject of half his acceptance speech for best supporting male actor.",
      "While he waited for the photo session, the 62-year-old Fiennes did some presses with his award with each arm.",
      "The 79-year-old Lithgow held his over his head with one arm as the photos were snapped.",

      "They later made their way to Ford, who wanted to talk with them for a while before taking a picture.",

      "The SAG Awards are also a union meeting, and this group, who went on a historic strike in 2023, were asked through fliers at place settings, a video that played during a break, and a pre-telecast plea from their leader to support their striking colleagues who work on video games.",

      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

      "The other major awards \u2014 including the BAFTAs, the Producers Guild Awards, the Directors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes \u2014 have all had their say. But actors make up the largest piece of the film academy pie, so their picks often correspond strongly with Academy Award winners.",
      "After wins from the PGA and the DGA \u2014 and last night, the Independent Spirit Awards \u2014 Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d is seen as the favorite to win best picture in a week\u2019s time at the Oscars. But Edward Berger\u2019s \u201cConclave\u201d won last weekend at the BAFTAs, the latest wrench in an award season full of them. That\u2019s included the unlikely rise and precipitous fall of another top contender, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "So there are plenty of questions heading into the SAG Awards, hosted by Kristen Bell from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Can \u201cWicked\u201d make a late push and win the guild\u2019s top award, best ensemble? Can Adrien Brody hold off Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for best actor? Can Mikey Madison keep the momentum and win best actress over Demi Moore?",
      "The 31st SAG Awards will be streamed live by Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An official pre-show will start an hour earlier, also on Netflix. Last year\u2019s show, the first to air on the streaming platform, drew an audience of 1.8 million, roughly on par with earlier SAG ceremonies broadcast by TNT and TBS.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d comes in the leading film nominee, with five nods, while \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d heads the TV categories.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s hit musical hasn\u2019t yet had a major awards win, but the Screen Actors Guild has often favored populist contenders. Also up for best ensemble are \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "The best actor and best actress categories should be nail biters. While Brody (\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d) has won a string of awards, Chalamet (\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d) and Ralph Fiennes (\u201cConclave\u201d) could easily pull off the upset. Best actress could go to either Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) or Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d).",
      "In the supporting categories, Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d) and Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) are the favorites.",
      "In addition to the competitive categories, Jane Fonda will be given the SAG Life Achievement Award.",
      "The devastating wildfires that began in early January forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and instead issue a press release. The guild has launched a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected by the fires. Producers have said the show will honor those affected."

      "Speaking to The Associated Press on the red carpet at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, the 26-year-old actor, who is trans, said she felt \u201cit was a good, necessary point\u201d to share. Schafer, also a presenter at the award show, was nominated for best lead performance for \u201cCuckoo. \u201d",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office instituting a new and narrow federal government definition of the sexes. As part of the order, the federal government defines sex as only male or female and says that must be reflected on official documents, like passports. The State Department, responsible for passports, is no longer issuing passports with the \u201cX\u201d marker that\u2019s been available since 2021 and is not honoring requests to change gender markers between \u201cM\u201d and \u201cF.\u201d",
      "In an 8 \u00bd-minute video posted to TikTok on Friday, Schafer, who transitioned as a young teen, said the passport that was meant to carry her well into her 30s was stolen while she was filming in Spain. After receiving an emergency passport, she later had to apply for a new, permanent one in Los Angeles. Having had female gender markers on her license and passport since she was a teenager, Schafer marked \u201cfemale\u201d on her application \u2014 but received a passport that identified her as male, she said. In the video, she said she had not had her birth certificate amended.",
      "Schafer acknowledged the executive order in her TikTok video: \u201cBecause our president, you know, is a lot of talk, I was like, \u2018I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u2019 And, today, I saw it,\u201d Schafer said, holding up her new passport page with the \u201cM\u201d marker. She said she was making the video not to \u201cfearmonger or like create drama or receive consolation,\u201d but to note the reality of the situation.",
      "\u201cI wasn't even really looking for support, but I have an amazing community around me and it's one of the greatest blessings of my life and so I felt very supported throughout, before and then now,\u201d she told the AP on Saturday.",
      "The State Department said in response to a request for comment that it was implementing Trump\u2019s executive order but declined to comment on specific cases, citing privacy laws and restrictions.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really change anything about me or my transness. However, it does make my life a little harder,\u201d Schafer said in the video, saying she has to travel for the first time with the new passport next week.",
      "\u201cTrans people are beautiful. We are never going to stop existing. I'm never going to stop being trans. A letter and a passport can't change that,\u201d she concluded.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d soared on opening weekend, but crash-landed in its second go-around with audiences.",
      "\u201cBrave New World,\u201d the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn\u2019t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%.",
      "While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023\u2019s \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which fell 78%, and 2023\u2019s \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\u201d which dropped 70%.",

      "Still, \u201cBrave New World\u201d has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March.",
      "The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins\u2019 \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d the director\u2019s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, \u201cLonglegs.\u201d Adapted from a Stephen King short story, \u201cThe Monkey\u201d opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor.

      "As it did with \u201cLonglegs,\u201d Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for \u201cThe Monkey,\u201d along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held Los Angeles\u2019 Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make.",
      "Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Unbreakable Boy\u201d opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease.",

      "NEW YORK -- Joy Reid is leaving MSNBC, the network's new president announced in a memo to staff on Monday, marking an end to the political analyst and anchor's prime time news show.",
      "Reid's namesake show, \u201cThe ReidOut,\u201d has been a fixture of MSNBC's evening programming since 2020. In the hourlong newscast, held at 7 p.m. E.T., Reid conducts extensive interviews with politicians and other newsmakers.",
      "\u201cJoy Reid is leaving the network and we thank her for her countless contributions over the years,\" MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler wrote Monday. \u201dHer work has been recognized with several esteemed honors, including most recently, the 2025 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding News Series.\"",

      "The great Roberta Flack has died",
      "NEW YORK -- In an era where popular music is fluid, it is easy to forget the listening world was not always so open. Unless, of course, Roberta Flack's career is closely examined.",
      "Flack, whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday. She leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, \u201cFirst Take,\u201d wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach.",
      "Flack will likely be remembered for her classics \u2014 \u201cThe First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\u201d and \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\u201d among them. As she should be. But her talents extend well beyond the familiar titles.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist, here.",
      "Picking one standout from \u201cFirst Take\u201d is a fool's errand, but listeners would be wise to spend time with Flack's cover of the Leonard Cohen classic \u201cHey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye,\u201d a strong case for a reimagination eclipsing the original. Her voice transforms Cohen's lament. It's almost impossible to believe this song, let alone the entire record, was recorded over a period of just 10 hours at Atlantic Studios in New York in February 1969. But it was.",
      "Also from \u201cFirst Take\" is \u201cAngelitos Negros,\" performed entirely in Spanish by Flack. It's a song based on a poem by the Venezuelan writer Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco titled \u201cP\u00edntame Angelitos Negros,\" with a title lifted from the 1948 Mexican film of the same name.",
      "The movie navigates interracial relationships when a white couple gives birth to a dark-skinned child. Beyond Flack's soaring vocal performance \u2014 delivered atop a robust string section and nylon-string guitars \u2014 the song serves as an anthem against racial discrimination and a stunning example of the singer's cross-boundary approach to music making.",
      "As the well-documented lore suggests, Roberta Flack's mainstream success story begins when her dreamy cover of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger, was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \u201cPlay Misty for Me.\"",
      "It quickly topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. But her relationship with the song, and her singular ability to bring it to such great heights, was almost kismet. Before recording the ballad, she had real familiarity with it, having taught it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "It is Flack's best-known hit and one of the great love songs of the 20th Century. Flack first heard Lori Lieberman\u2019s \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\u201d while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience feel in love with it, too, as they'd continue to for decades.",
      "Her voice is otherworldly in her recording \u2014 pinpointing a kind of neo-soul R&B that would dominate for years to come \u2014 and she was recognized for it. Flack became the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record with this one.",
      "The song would win again in the \u201890s, when hip-hop trio the Fugees\u2019 would offer their masterful take on Flack's cover and introduce much of the world to singer Lauryn Hill's gift.",
      "A standard for R&B and jazz musicians alike \u2014 no doubt due to the grandeur of Flack's version \u2014 \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d is her third career No. 1. It's a mediative seduction, Flack embodying each lyrical vignette in her delivery. \u201cStrollin\u2019 in the park / Watchin\u2019 winter turn to spring,\u201d she opens the song, \u201cWalkin\u2019 in the dark / Seein\u2019 lovers do their thing.\u201d",
      "A soulful collaboration with her close friend Donny Hathaway, \u201cThe Closer I Get to You,\" is a reflective romance, both big-voiced and bigger-hearted singers lifting each other up. But despite its splendor, the song's legacy is marred in tragedy: In 1979, Flack and Hathaway started work on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "The '80s brought soft rock detouring for Flack, another experimentation for the innovative performer. \u201cTonight, I Celebrate My Love,\" a duet with the R&B balladeer Peabo Bryson, is at the intersection of a few genres and simultaneously timeless \u2014 a feat for a song anchored in shimmery, synthetized production.",
      "In her later career, Flack continued to meet the current moment. A great example is \u201cSet the Night to Music,\u201d a glossy pop song with English singer Maxi Priest. It was released on her 1991 album of the same name, which also features a then-contemporary cover of Philadelphia soul group The Stylistics' 1970s R&B hit \u201cYou Make Me Feel Brand New.\""

      "Actor Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death adds to the list of celebrity deaths in South Korea that underscore the enormous pressure they face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that pounces on their every misstep",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",
      "\u201cHer private life was indiscriminately reported beyond what was necessary,\u201d Heo said. \"That\u2019s not a legitimate matter of public interest.\u201d",

      "A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show last week",
      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers.",
      "Many content creators, journalists and digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand the government\u2019s powers to regulate digital media content.",
      "\u201cI think we are facing a threat that this particular incident might be a trigger point for obscenity laws,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy analyst and founder of the tech website MediaNama.",
      "In Allahbadia's case, observers say the controversy was blown out of proportion and could lead to a chilling effect on India\u2019s comedy scene.",
      "\"The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere is a very strong determining factor that decides whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,\u201d said Anurag Minus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi.",
      "This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced police crackdowns or their shows being cancelled.",
      "Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's rule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons.",
      "In 2021, comedian Vir Das faced police complaints for his \u201cI Come from Two Indias\u201d show, which was critical of India over its fight against COVID-19, crimes against women and crackdowns on comedians. During his show, Das described India as a country where people \u201cworship women during the day but gang rape them at night.\u201d",
      "That same year comedians Munawar Faruqui and Nalin Yadav were arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian state that\u2019s ruled by Modi\u2019s party. Faruqui was jailed for a month."

      "According to Grammy Award-winner Chandrika Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries",
      "(RNS) \u2014 The winner of the 2025 Grammy Award for best new age, ambient or chant album \u2014 a category once dominated by Enya \u2014 was an album titled \u201cTriveni,\u201d meaning \u201cthe confluence of three rivers\u201d in Sanskrit, an apt description for its weaving of Vedic chants, melodic flute and cello by India\u2019s Chandrika Tandon, South Africa\u2019s Wouter Kellerman and Japan\u2019s Eru Matsumoto.",
      "The name, which is given to the meeting point of the holy Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers, said singer Tandon, came to her in one of her daily meditations.",
      "\u201cIt was a beautiful coincidence that our album called Triveni won the Grammy on Vasant Panchami when the Maha Prayag was going on,\u201d Tandon told RNS, referring to the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela festival held where the three rivers meet in Prayagraj, India, considered one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in the nation. The world\u2019s largest gathering of humanity, with 400 million people attending this year, the Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years, with this year\u2019s celebration, the Maha Kumbh Mela, happening only every 144 years, when the sun, the moon and Jupiter align.",
      "\u201cThink what you like, say what you like, but one has to just smile at this incredible coincidence,\u201d Tandon said.",

      "This content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.",
      "___",
      "Tandon was a prominent business mogul for more than half her life, the namesake of New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and sister to former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. Twenty-five years ago, however, Tandon faced what she describes as a \u201ccrisis of spirit.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew I had everything, and yet I felt like I had nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I died today, what is it that I want to have accomplished? Is it just more money, more climbing up the ladder, or was there something else that would just give me happiness and make each day complete?\u201d",
      "That something else, she found, was devotional music. Pulling from the mantras she once heard as a little girl in Chennai, Tandon found a new purpose in creating melodies and \u201cpraying into the notes\u201d as a form of meditation. \u201cMusic helped me find myself,\u201d said Tandon, the creator of six albums of her own.",
      "And according to Tandon, the Grammy win signifies a larger cultural moment, helping young people all over the world discover the \u201cextraordinary gems\u201d of the ancient Vedic traditions. \u201cInstead of a traditional Indian ornate piece of jewelry, I\u2019ve simply put them in a completely Western jewelry setting,\u201d said Tandon. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s more apparent, it\u2019s more discernible, more relatable. And suddenly there\u2019s this curiosity about, \u2018What is that? It makes me feel so good!\u2019\u201d",
      "According to Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries. The 21st is no different, they say, as they see a burgeoning space for the spiritually curious youth seeking a respite from the fast-paced internet culture they grew up in. Now, a new generation of kirtan artists is leading the charge on Hindu sacred music.",
      "Amid confusing times, says devotional musician Gaura Vani, Generations Z and X have found a way to articulate their complicated emotions and feelings through the call-and-response style of kirtans, the devotional songs commonly associated with the Hare Krishna faith.",
      "\u201cThis is almost a miraculous thing to say, but in this world of social media and phone addiction and all that, the kids in the Krishna community are doing the craziest thing: Without anyone telling them to, they will find a weekend where everyone\u2019s free, they will dress to the nines together, and find a temple or a space where they will do kirtans for, like, 10 hours straight,\u201d he told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It makes no sense in the modern world, but they\u2019re doing it.\u201d",
      "Vani, born into an American Hare Krishna family, just performed his first solo live concert at Mumbai\u2019s Royal Opera House in late January. Once the head of the successful early 2000s \u201cKrishna-conscious\u201d rock band As Kindred Spirits, Vani joined musicians from the East and the West for a fusion of world music, mantra, pop and rock. \u201cIt\u2019s all about spiritual stories and spiritual music from around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my jam.\u201d",
      "Some form of singing or chanting takes place in almost every Hindu tradition, says Vani, but the bhakti, or devotional, tradition practiced by members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, places an emphasis on music as a way to connect with the Divine, and \u201cas a way to create harmony, peace in the world, peace in oneself and to heal both spiritually and physically.\u201d",
      "The Maha Mantra, a repetition of the words \u201cHare,\u201d or praise, \u201cKrishna\u201d and \u201cRama,\u201d set to any melody the singer, or kirtaniya, chooses, is an ISKCON staple. This Sanskrit call-and-response, with the names of God sung alongside a harmonium and a mridanga, a type of drum, says Vani, can lead participants to a \u201cflow state\u201d where it may feel like \u201cmusic is kind of descending from the heavens and coming out through you.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to ecstasy I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d said Vani.",
      "Steeped in this tradition since birth, Vani and his wife, a trained Indian classical dancer, have now surrounded their three teenage children with song and dance. But as Vani has taught his kids, spiritual meaning is not limited to kirtans: \u201cIf you look for it, spiritual music is all around us, in all cultures,\u201d he said, from gospel to Sufi Zikr to praise music from South Africa. And, says Vani, it\u2019s in his daily playlist of Nora Jones, George Harrison, the Talking Heads and The Police. (The latter\u2019s song \u201cSpirits in the Material World\u201d is, he said, a personal family favorite.)",
      "Premanjali Dejager, a 24-year-old \u201cKrishna kid\u201d \u2014 a term of endearment for those raised in a Hare Krishna household \u2014 lives in New York\u2019s Bhakti Center ashram and doesn\u2019t go a day without chanting the Maha Mantra a few times. The kirtaniya, who grew up in Australia, says kirtans can feel like a \u201cspiritual dance party,\u201d where \u201cteenage angst\u201d and \u201cclub dance moves\u201d meet in a safe, nondestructive environment.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the midst of it, like, when someone is really singing from their heart and, like, really connecting, you feel that sense of connection in the room,\u201d Dejager, who grew up in Australia, told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s just contagious.\u201d",
      "Dejager has sung around the world with her guru Indradyumna Swami, known as the Travelling Monk, since graduating gurukul, or \u201cspiritual high school,\u201d in 2018. But, she said, she wasn\u2019t always so musically inclined. \u201cI was actually a really terrible singer,\u201d she said, recalling that she was removed from her primary school\u2019s singing group because she \u201cjust couldn\u2019t sing on key.\u201d",
      "Yet taking singing lessons in jazz and pop music grew Dejager\u2019s confidence, and she started posting devotional singing videos on social media, some of them \u201creally cringy.\u201d Today, she has more than 50,000 Instagram followers and her own virtual kirtan school, where she has, since 2021, taught other aspiring singers over Zoom that what\u2019s important is \u201cbeing real,\u201d or coming as you are to the devotional practice.",
      "\u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m feeling really sad or going through something difficult or having to make a difficult decision, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a prayer offering of like, \u2018Krishna, I need your help here. I need your guidance.\u2019 And sometimes it does happen where I\u2019m having to catch myself from like spacing out, and my mind goes everywhere. It is a practice of constantly trying to bring the mind back and just trying to bring my heart into the picture.\u201d",
      "Nikita Bhasin, a California native, considers herself more spiritual than religious. A certified yoga instructor since the age of 17, Bhasin was raised attending and singing devotionals at the Kali Mandir in Laguna Beach \u2014 a common story of being \u201cdragged along by my family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI left all the kirtan stuff behind because I was older and I didn\u2019t have to do what my parents told me to do,\u201d Bhasin, 27, told RNS.",
      "But Bhasin eventually found her way back to the music, when she learned yoga from an instructor who began practice with the same chants she heard as a child, but in a \u201cmore digestible\u201d 10-minute format rather than the three hours she spent at the temple. She took up the harmonium and now opens and closes each of her yoga classes in New York, barring if they are in a gym setting, with a Sanskrit chant, often to the theme of the asanas, or postures, such as repeating \u201cJai Ma,\u201d or hail Mother Earth, in a class about \u201cbalancing opposition.\u201d",
      "Many of her students have never chanted before, holding varying beliefs (or no beliefs) about God, some coming only for the physical asanas of yoga. Bhasin invites them to \u201cput their own spin\u201d on the ancient practice.",
      "\u201cA lot of these chants, you are chanting to something higher than yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of interpretations of that. There\u2019s thousands of lineages that think of God or divine as something different: Divine could be a hug from your friend, or it could be feeling like you\u2019re not on autopilot and are grateful and connecting with people in your life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting, because a lot of people tell me after class that they haven\u2019t sung since they were like 10 years old, and this is how they\u2019re coming back to their body and coming back to this childlike spirit of just letting go,\u201d she said."

      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, MGM Amazon announced that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control",
      "NEW YORK -- In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\u201cWith my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\u201d Wilson said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\u201d",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.5 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007 concluded with 2021's \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",

    "summary": "The Oscars are more international than ever",
    "story": [
      "The Oscars are more international than ever",
      "NEW YORK -- For many filmmakers, the Oscars are a pipe dream. But not because they think their movies aren\u2019t good enough.",
      "The Iranian director, Mohammad Rasoulof, for instance, knew his native country was more likely to jail him than submit his film for the Academy Awards. Iran, like some other countries including Russia, has an official government body that selects its Oscar submission. For a filmmaker like Rasoulof, who has brazenly tested his country\u2019s censorship restrictions, that made the Oscars out of the question.",
      "\u201cA lot of independent filmmakers in Iran think that we would never be able to make it to the Oscars,\u201d Rasoulof said in an interview through an interpreter. \u201cThe Oscars were never part of my imagination because I was always at war with the Iranian government.\u201d",
      "Unlike other categories at the Academy Awards, the initial selection for the best international film category is outsourced. Individual countries make their submission, one movie per country.",
      "Sometimes that\u2019s an easy call. When the category \u2014 then \u201cbest foreign language film\u201d \u2014 was established, it would have been hard to quibble with Italy\u2019s pick: Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Strada,\u201d the category\u2019s first winner in 1957.",
      "But, often, there\u2019s great debate about which movie a country ought to submit \u2014 especially when undemocratic governments do the selecting. Rasoulof\u2019s fellow Iranian New Wave director Jafar Panahi likewise had no hopes of Iran selecting his 2022 film \u201cNo Bears\u201d for the Oscars. At the time, Panahi was imprisoned by Iran, which didn\u2019t release him until he went on a hunger strike.",
      "Rasoulof\u2019s film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d \u2014 a movie shot clandestinely in Iran before its director and cast fled the country \u2014 ultimately was nominated for best international film. But on March 2, it will be at the Oscars representing Germany, the country Rasoulof made his home in after being sentenced to flogging and eight years in prison in Iran.",
      "\u201cThe film, to a large degree, is now a German film, both because of the distribution company and because of all the people who worked on it post-production, including myself,\u201d said Rasoulof. \u201cI\u2019m a person who\u2019s been ripped of his Iranian national identity.\u201d",
      "The Oscars are more international than ever. This year's lead nominee, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d is the most nominated non-English language film ever. It\u2019s a Mexico-set, Spanish-language film shot outside Paris \u2014 a reflection of how borderless film can be. (It's France's Oscar submission.) For the seventh year in a row, a foreign-language film has been nominated for best picture. And for the first time, in fact, there are two up for Hollywood\u2019s top prize: \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and the Brazilian drama \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "The historic 2020 win for \u201cParasite,\u201d the first non-English language best picture winner, wasn\u2019t just, as director Bong Joon Ho called it then, a victory over \u201cthe one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles.\u201d It was the sign of a tectonic shift in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. To diversify its membership, the academy has in recent years invited hundreds of overseas voters, tipping the Oscar scales. The Academy Awards have gone global.",
      "And yet the Academy Awards' marquee category for international cinema, best international film, has been continually criticized as unjust, outdated and subject to political interference. \u201cThe Oscars\u2019 international film category is broken,\u201d wrote film critic Alissa Wilkinson in 2020 for Vox. \u201cNothing short of a total overhaul of the category is order,\u201d wrote Variety critic Peter Debruge in 2022.",
      "The academy has sometimes tweaked the category, which was renamed in 2020. In 2006, the academy ruled that international submissions no longer needed to be in the language of its home country. Last year\u2019s winner, \u201cThe Zone of Interest,\u201d was a German-language film set at Auschwitz, but marked the United Kingdom's first best international film Oscar.",
      "To help guard the process from outside influence, the academy in 2023 specified that each country\u2019s selection committees must be at least 50% composed of \u201cfilmmakers, artists and craftspeople.\u201d But who those people are, and what their subjective sense of national identity might be, has often been questionable.",
      "This year, one of the most conspicuous absences from the Oscars is Payal Kapadia\u2019s \u201cAll We Imagine As Light,\u201d an Indian drama that numerous critics have named the best film of 2024. It was the first Indian film to play in competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 30 years.",
      "The Film Federation of Indian instead chose Kiran Rao\u2019s \u201cLaapataa Ladies,\u201d a glossier comedy from Jio Studios that the academy ultimately passed on. FFI president Ravi Kottarakara told the Hollywood Reporter India that the jury, which was all male, felt \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d was like \u201cwatching a European film taking place in India.\u201d",
      "Kapadia, speaking shortly after that decision, praised the choice of \u201cLaapataa Ladies\u201d while taking issue with the jury\u2019s metric.",
      "\u201cWhat is Indian? It\u2019s a very big continent that we have,\u201d said Kapadia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Indias. I\u2019m really happy with the film they chose. It\u2019s a really nice film. I liked it a lot. But I feel like these kind of statements, I don\u2019t know what purpose they serve. The committee that made the selection was 13 men. Is that very Indian?\"",
      "Rancor over the Greek selection process led 20 filmmakers to withdraw their submissions for this year\u2019s Oscars to protest the Greece Ministry of Culture's sudden replacement of selection committee members.",
      "Renos Haralambidis, one of the filmmakers who withdrew his film, told Balkan Investigative Reporting Network: \u201cI believe that the committee that will choose which film will be nominated for the Oscars should be independent of the state, because I believe the less the state in art, the better.\u201d",
      "The question for the academy is: Does it want this annual drama in the international film category? Should governments, autocratic or not, have any say in what films are in the running for one of the most sought-after Oscars?",
      "The film academy declined to comment for this article.",
      "These are issues the Oscars have long been aware of. Sometimes, the academy has even lent a hand to a country making its first submission. That was the case when Bhutan established a selection committee so it could nominated Pawo Choyning Dorji\u2019s 2019 film \u201cLunana: A Yak in the Classroom.\u201d It surprised pundits and received an Oscar nomination, Bhutan\u2019s first.",
      "What options does the academy have? It could make its own international film selection committee, like those that exist in other categories, and remove governments completely from the process. Some have advocated for expanding the category to 10 nominees, like best picture, and doing away with the one-nation, one-movie rule. Another option: Keep the current system but allow for several academy committee-chosen slots so that political dissidents aren't ruled out.",
      "Such changes would surely be welcome news to those who believed France last year should have submitted Justine Triet\u2019s best picture-nominated legal drama \u201cAnatomy of a Fall,\u201d or India ought to have backed the Telugu-language smash \u201cRRR.\u201d Both picked up Oscars in other categories.",
      "Regardless, it\u2019s clear that geopolitics have increasingly made the best international film award at the Oscars almost as quarrelsome as the rest of our global existence.",
      "For any peace in the category, you\u2019d have to look to the Latvian entry, \u201cFlow,\u201d an animated animal parable nominated for both best international film and best animated film. While it\u2019s nominated by Latvia, it contains no language, at all, just a few meows and some barking.",

      "Monroe County Coroner Thomas Yanac confirmed her death Friday to The Associated Press, saying she died at her home in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, after a stint on hospice care. She died of natural causes.",
      "A representative for the estate of The Notorious B.I.G. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Notorious B.I.G., one of the rap\u2019s greatest performers, was shot to death at age 24 in Los Angeles in 1997. The case remains unsolved. He was survived by his wife, the musician and actress Faith Evans, and his two children, Christopher Jordan Wallace and T\u2019yanna Dream Wallace.",
      "Wallace was a dedicated keeper of the legacy of her son, born Christopher Wallace. When he first emerged on the scene as one of rap's most distinctive talents with songs that expertly detailed street life in Brooklyn, she labeled his music \u201cnoise.\u201d",
      "Since his death, his gift took on a new meaning for her. She told AP in 2017, 20 years after his death, \u201cI remembered my son said, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to my music.\u2019 And I never listened to his music. I heard it on the radio and it sounded good, because it was clean. But I said, \u2018You know what, I have to. I have to listen to that music.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I did.\"",
      "\u201cI cried so much that day just listening to the music. I remember I sat, I stood. I rested my head on the stereo and I just cried like a baby. And that was therapy for me. And I said, \u2018Oh my God \u2014 that was a talented young man to put those words together.\u2019 He had a beautiful voice. I love his voice,\u201d she continued.",
      "Wallace launched the Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation following her son's death, an organization that provides educational resources for children. In 2003, she honored mothers of other musicians who died untimely deaths \u2014 Aaliyah, Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopes, Tupac Shakur, Jam Master Jay, Big Pun, Big L and Freaky Tah \u2014 at \u201cB.I.G. Night Out,\u201d a benefit for the foundation.",
      "\u201cIt is our way of saying, \u2018Keep your head up,\u201d\u2019 Wallace told AP at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s the foundation\u2019s way just to let these parents know that we love them.\u201d",
      "She also took legal action on behalf of her son. In 2004, she dropped a wrongful-death lawsuit against a former suspect in the rap star\u2019s slaying \u2014 Amir Muhammad, aka Harry Billups. The 2002 lawsuit also named the city of Los Angeles and Muhammad\u2019s former college roommate, David A. Mack, a Los Angeles policeman. It accused Mack of hiring Muhammad to shoot the hip-hop artist and police of failing to investigate properly after a fellow officer came under suspicion.",
      "In 2021, Wallace worked as an executive producer on the Netflix documentary \u201cBiggie: I Got a Story to Tell,\" and told AP about her role in the public eye.",
      "\u201cThey never knew me. The public never knew me. I was thrust into this environment, I should say, after he passed away, because I\u2019m a very private person. Extremely private,\" she said. \"What he was doing out there, maybe I should have known. But honestly, I didn\u2019t.

    "story": [
      "Being cut cut from her high school basketball team was painful for Baileigh Sinaman-Daniel, but she refused to let that rejection, or being born with one arm, stop her from pursuing her basketball dreams",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- When her high school basketball coach cut her from the team senior year, Baileigh Sinaman-Daniel refused to let that rejection, or the fact she was born with one arm, end her dream of playing the game that her childhood idol LeBron James made her fall in love with 15 years ago.",
      "That determination led the 22-year-old guard at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to become the first NCAA Division III women\u2019s basketball player with one arm to score in a collegiate game, said her coach, Martin Rather.",
      "\u201cI kind of just shot the ball with the anticipation that I would have to go and get it back on a rebound,\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said of the historic basket that she made from near the three-point line, which snapped the net without hitting the rim. \u201cWhen the shot actually went in, I was more so surprised.\u201d",
      "Rather immediately called a timeout to mark the moment.",
      "\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018That\u2019s history and we need to take a second to pause and celebrate it,\u2019\u201d Rather said. \u201cEverybody just swarmed Baileigh, giving her high fives, celebrating her.\u201d",
      "The Stafford, Virginia, native\u2019s path to history was sparked by a painful rejection at Mountain View High School.",
      "\u201cI had played for my high school for about three years and my senior year of high school when I tried out again, as I always did, I actually got cut and the coach basically told me that I wasn\u2019t needed on the team,\u201d she said.",
      "That led to two days of misery and crying, until she made a bold decision while sitting in her car.",
      "\u201cI thought to myself, I could do this in college. What\u2019s stopping me from doing this in college?\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said. \u201cSo, I started emailing hundreds of coaches and it didn\u2019t really matter what division it was. I was just trying to get a possible maybe or even better \u2014 a yes.\u201d",
      "That persistence caught Rather\u2019s attention when Sinaman-Daniel, a 5-foot-6-inch guard, entered the transfer portal after two years at Warren Wilson College in North Carolina.",
      "At Lesley, Sinaman-Daniel has become known for her work ethic with the Lynx.",
      "She has completed more individual practice sessions than any other player on the team, which is having its best season in 14 years and has reached the playoffs, Rather said.",
      "\u201cI think any team in this country would benefit from having a player with Baileigh\u2019s heart on their team,\u201d Rather said.",
      "The achievement is particularly notable given the scarcity of one-armed players in collegiate basketball who could have served as role models.",
      "\u201cIt is not very common to see somebody with one arm playing basketball. I think there\u2019s probably about two or three of us in the collegiate level,\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said.",
      "Though there are few other notable one-armed college basketball players, the most successful is likely Hansel Emmanuel at Austin Peay, whose coach describes as \u201cthe biggest inspiration in college sports.\u201d The athletic success of the 6-foot-6 men\u2019s Division I junior, whose arm was amputated at age 6 after an accident, has proved limitations don\u2019t define potential.",
      "Since Sinaman-Daniel could not always use standard balance and ball management techniques used by two-armed players, her on-court success has required unique training methods allowing her to develop fundamental skills.",
      "\u201cTaking passes or giving a good pass or figuring out the right shooting form \u2014 I\u2019ve had to tweak and adjust,\u201d she said.",
      "Sinaman-Daniel scored her second basket on her birthday, some seven weeks after her initial score, adding another layer of satisfaction to her breakthrough season.",
      "The junior guard who was born with a tiny right arm that she is unable to use is studying psychology at the university just outside Boston and hopes her achievement will inspire others facing similar challenges.",
      "\u201cWhen people look at me, I just hope they see me as Baileigh. I hope they see me as a basketball player and also see me as somebody who\u2019s willing and able to do everything that everybody else is doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Rather sees her impact extending beyond the court.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re showing that we can both win and have really high quality players that might not look like everybody else on our team,\u201d he said."

      "A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims",
      "VANNES, France -- A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.",
      "He does not deny the allegations, though says he doesn't remember everything. Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to prison terms ranging from three to 20 years.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations have called for a rally on Monday in front of the courthouse where Le Scouarnec will be tried.",
      "The case began in 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor said Le Scouarnec had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "He had admitted to child abuse dating to 1985-1986, but some cases could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine alleged rapes and other abuses committed between 1989 and 2014 against 158 men and 141 women who were aged 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to investigation documents.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the post-operation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital when she was 9 years old in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot.\"",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,\u201d she told public broadcaster France 3. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression. ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper his client will \u201canswer the judges\u2019 questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn\u2019t allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral",
      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades, and said the lack of fluoride showed.",

      "That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far \u2014 and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth.",
      "The talks in Colombia known as COP16 yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature \u2014 say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants \u2014 to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters.",
      "But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done.",
      "The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework.",
      "\u201cMontreal was about the \u2018what\u2019 \u2014 what are we all working towards together?\u201d said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. \u201cCali was supposed to focus on the \u2018how\u2019 \u2014 putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,\u201d said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks \u201cAnd so now we\u2019re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.\u201d",
      "The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Qu\u00e9bec, Spain, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Participants will discuss establishing a \u201cglobal financing instrument for biodiversity\u201d intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money.",
      "Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really about how do we collect the money and how do we get it distributed fairly, get it to the ground where it\u2019s needed most, so that that\u2019s really the core issue,\u201d said Kruger.",
      "Oscar Soria, chief executive of The Common Initiative, a think tank specializing in global economic and environmental policy, was pessimistic about raising a great deal more money.",
      "\u201cWe are completely off track in terms of achieving that money,\u201d Soria said. Key sources of biodiversity finance are shrinking or disappearing, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat was supposed to be a good Colombian telenovela in which people will actually bring the right resources, and the happy ending of bringing their money, could actually end up being a tragic Italian opera, where no one actually agrees to anything and everyone loses,\u201d Soria said.",
      "Susana Muhamad, Colombia's former environment minister and the COP16 president, said she's hopeful of \u201ca good message from Rome.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat message is that still, even with a very fragmented geopolitical landscape, with a world increasingly in conflict, we can still get an agreement on some fundamental issues,\" Muhamad said in a statement. \"And one of the most important is the need to protect life in this crisis of climate change and biodiversity.\u201d",
      "Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to an October report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London.",
      "\u201cBiodiversity is basically essential to our livelihoods and well-being,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to the the air we breathe, the water we drink, rainfall that food systems rely on, protecting us from increasing temperatures and increasing storm occurrences as well.\u201d",
      "Chandler said deforestation in the Amazon has far-reaching impacts across South America, just as it does in the Congo Basin and other major biodiverse regions worldwide.",
      "\u201cWe know that has an impact on rainfall, on food systems, on soil integrity in other countries. So it\u2019s not just something that\u2019s kind of small and isolated. It's a widespread problem,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "A court battle is set to resume over the Trump administration&rsquo;s drastic cuts in medical research funding",
    "story": [
      "A court battle is set to resume over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding",
      "BOSTON -- A court battle is set to resume Friday over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding that many scientists say will endanger patients and delay new lifesaving discoveries.",
      "A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily blocked the cuts from taking effect earlier this month in response to separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide.",
      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries. Now U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, must decide whether to extend the temporary restraining order blocking those cuts.",
      "The states and research groups say such a move is illegal, pointing to bipartisan congressional action during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term to prohibit it.",
      "\u201cYet here we are again,\u201d attorneys argued in a court motion, saying the NIH is \u201cin open defiance\u201d of what Congress decreed.",
      "In its own written arguments, the Trump administration said NIH has authority to alter the terms after awarding grants and that Kelley\u2019s courtroom isn\u2019t the proper venue to arbitrate claims of breach of contract.",
      "States and researchers \u201chave failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury,\u201d according to the administration motion.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded more than 60,000 grants last year totaling about $35 billion. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \u201cindirect\u201d costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \u201coverhead\u201d but universities and hospitals argue they\u2019re far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Different projects require different resources. Labs that handle dangerous viruses, for example, require more expensive safety precautions than a simpler experiment. So currently each grant\u2019s amount of indirect costs is negotiated with NIH, some of them small while others reaching 50% or more of the total grant.",
      "If the new policy stands, indirect costs would be capped at 15% immediately, for already awarded grants and new ones. NIH calculated that would save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "A motion filed earlier this week cited a long list of examples of immediate harm in blue states and red states. They included the possibility of ending some clinical trials of treatments at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, that could leave \u201ca population of patients with no viable alternative.\"",
      "Officials at Johns Hopkins University were more blunt, saying the cut would end or require significantly scaling back research projects potentially including some of the 600 NIH-funded studies open to Hopkins patients.",
      "\u201cThe care, treatments and medical breakthroughs provided to them and their families are not \u2018overhead,\u2019\u201d university president Ron Daniels and Hopkins Medicine CEO Theodore DeWeese wrote to employees.",
      "Attorneys also argued the cuts would harm state economies. The University of Florida would need to cut \u201ccritical research staffing\u201d by about 45 people, while construction of a new research facility in Detroit expected to create nearly 500 new jobs could be paused or even abandoned, they wrote.",
      "\u201cImplementing this 15% cap will mean the abrupt loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that are already committed to employing tens of thousands of researchers and other workers, putting a halt to countless lifesaving health research and cutting-edge technology initiatives,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "Authorities say a gunman entered a Pennsylvania hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead",
      "YORK, Pa. -- A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital's intensive care unit Saturday and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.",
      "Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall.",
      "Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge loss to our community,\u201d Barker said at a press conference following the shooting. \u201cIt is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force.\u201d",
      "Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for \u201ca medical purpose involving another individual\u201d and he intentionally targeted the workers there.",
      "No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz.",
      "The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York Borough Police Department.",
      "\u201cWe all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,\u201d West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.",
      "Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a \u201chero award\u201d in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado.",
      "\u201cI have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,\u201d his LinkedIn profile said.",
      "Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department there said in a statement.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he met Saturday evening with Duarte's parents and fellow officers who were wounded.",
      "\u201cTheir willingness to run toward danger helped save the lives of others,\u201d Shapiro said on the social platform X. \u201cI'm grateful to them and all law enforcement who answered the call today in York.\u201d",
      "At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland.",
      "\u201cHe was so young,\u201d Shields said of Duarte. \u201cIt makes no sense at all.\u201d",
      "Shapiro called the attack on police and health care workers \u201cthe act of a coward.\u201d",
      "UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940.",
      "The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire\u2019s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child\u2019s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.",

      "Abortion rights groups fear punishment for women who have abortions and governments tracking pregnancies",
      "Abortion rights advocates feared the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that opened the door to state abortion bans would also lead to tracking women and charging women who get abortions with murder.",
      "No states have allowed either, but the ideas, once off the table, have gotten attention in legislatures this month.",
      "Oklahoma lawmakers killed a bill that would have allowed murder charges after a public hearing, and North Dakota did so after a floor debate. Similar bills have been introduced before, but they haven't been granted hearings, in part because most major anti-abortion groups oppose them.",
      "A Missouri committee heard testimony on a bill to create a database of pregnant women deemed \u201cat risk\u201d of getting an abortion and connecting them with prospective adoptive parents.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the proposals:",
      "Under the Missouri legislation, the state Department of Social Services would be directed to create a new division tasked with maintaining a \u201ccentral registry of each expectant mother who is at risk for seeking an abortion.\u201d",
      "The division would also keep a list of prospective adoptive parents and coordinate adoption proceedings.",
      "House Speaker Jonathan Patterson, a Republican, said Thursday that he wants to aid adoption but that the bill doesn't have broad support among House Republicans. Two similar bills were rescinded this week.",
      "\u201cThere is some question about the central registry and databases,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cThat has to be really tightened up to make sure that people\u2019s privacy is protected.\u201d",

      "Still, it has won some support.",
      "\u201cBills like this continue to disprove the false narrative advanced by pro-abortion advocates that the pro-life movement does not care about women, or care about children after they are born,\u201d Susan Klein, executive director of Missouri Right to Life, wrote in a statement supporting the bill.",
      "The Planned Parenthood Federation of America says the Missouri legislation is the first of its kind, though fears over the potential tracking of pregnant women are nothing new.",
      "Abortion rights advocates have long argued that if individuals\u2019 reproductive health information is not kept private, then it could be used not only in targeted ads but also in law enforcement investigations. Some Democratic-led states have taken steps to protect such health data in recent years.",
      "On a call with reporters Wednesday, Katie Knutter, executive director of Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortion in Wyoming, said that she hears from out-of-state patients that they might be tracked by their home states when they seek abortion \u2014 even though laws to do so are not on the books.",
      "\u201cThe broader discussion in the media has made patients very aware and very concerned about these things,\u201d Knutter said.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday voted 6-2 against advancing a proposal to allow murder charges against women who obtain abortions, with possible punishments including the death penalty and life in prison.",
      "A week earlier, North Dakota\u2019s House rejected a measure with similar features 77-16.",
      "Groups including the National Right to Life Committee and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have for years been urging lawmakers not to consider those measures, arguing that women are often coerced into abortion and should not be punished.",
      "Some conservative lawmakers see it differently.",
      "\u201cWhile the abortion clinics no longer offer or perform abortion, there is a massive loophole in Oklahomans' laws,\u201d Sen. Dusty Deevers, who sponsored the Oklahoma measure, told the judiciary committee during a hearing Wednesday. \u201cNamely, they don\u2019t apply to the mothers themselves.\u201d",
      "Deevers said his approach is the only way to stop the flow of abortion pills prescribed by doctors in other states via telehealth and shipped in. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning, which advocates abortion access, found that there were nearly 1,000 abortions via telemedicine in Oklahoma in the second half of 2023. The Guttmacher Institute, another research organization that supports abortion rights, has found that by 2023, more than 6 in 10 abortions in the formal healthcare system nationally involved pills.",
      "Democrats and some Republicans on the committee had concerns, including that the law could lead to criminal investigations of women who have miscarriages, that such an extreme approach could rally support for a state constitutional amendment to allow abortion, or that enforcement would be hard.",
      "Similar measures in Idaho and Indiana appear unlikely to advance. Bills have also been introduced in South Carolina and Texas.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:56:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker&rsquo;s body",
    "story": [
      "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker\u2019s body",
      "NEW YORK -- While traveling in Europe, Margaux Lantelme noticed something different about the store cashiers: they did their work sitting down. It was a stark contrast to Chicago, where Lantelme works the register at REI and cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.",
      "For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She's still waiting for final approval.",
      "\u201cNot having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,\u201d Lantelme said. \u201cI personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.\u201d",
      "Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.",
      "Being on one's feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.",
      "The association recommends trying \u201cfatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,\u201d said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.",
      "Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.",
      "Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. \u201cIt takes a really hard toll on the knees,\u201d she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn\u2019t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.",
      "She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she'd been on her feet for five hours without a break.",
      "Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ortiz said.",
      "Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. \"Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,\" company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. \"This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.\u201d",
      "Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan's Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.",
      "\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been at the job, I\u2019ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we\u2019re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,\u201d bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. \u201cBeing able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I\u2019m doing things on the computer while I\u2019m at the registers.\u201d",
      "Spiegel\u2019s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it\u2019s hard for him to predict what days he\u2019ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.",
      "\u201cThere have been days that I\u2019ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it\u2019s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller\u2019s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president.",
      "During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. \u201cThe employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d",
      "In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Women were seen as the \u201cmothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,\u201d Boris added. \u201cAlmost every state had laws, but they weren\u2019t enforced.\u201d",
      "Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women's movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.",
      "Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. \u201cThe English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,\" Boris said.",
      "In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.",
      "Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with \u201cright to sit\u201d laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn\u2019t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.",

    "story": [
      "New York is suing several large electronic cigarette distributors for allegedly selling vaping flavors that can appeal to children",
      "New York on Thursday sued some of the country\u2019s biggest distributors of electronic cigarettes, accusing the companies of violating state laws that prohibit the sale of vaping flavors and designs that appeal to children.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James announced the lawsuit targeting middlemen that distribute fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and Elf Bar to hundreds of convenience stories and gas stations across the state. The approach differs from past litigation by New York and other states, which targeted vaping manufacturers, such as Juul Labs.",
      "Widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend, Juul has paid more than $1 billion to settle dozens of state and local lawsuits and investigations into its early marketing practices, which included launch parties and product giveaways. The company stopped selling flavors like mango and mint in 2019 and is no longer popular with teens.",
      "Instead, Chinese-made disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar have become the top choice among high school and middle school students. None of the products are approved by federal health regulators but they continue shipping into the U.S., often mislabeled as batteries, cell phones or other products.",
      "The state\u2019s nearly 200-page legal complaint points to \u201cwidespread evidence of illegal conduct, including documents showing illegal shipments of flavored vapes to New York.\u201d The filing also includes photos of brightly colored e-cigarettes that resemble soft drinks and candy and come in flavors like \u201cfruity bears freeze,\u201d \u201ccotton candy,\u201d and \u201cstrawberry cereal donut milk.\u201d",
      "New York banned all vaping flavors other than tobacco in 2020.",
      "\u201cFor too long, these companies have disregarded our laws in order to profit off of our young people, but we will not risk the health and safety of our kids,\u201d James said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the companies, as well as a permanent ban on their sales of flavored vapes in New York.",
      "In 2022 litigation, the co-founder of Buffalo-based Demand Vape told a federal judge that his company had sold more than $132 million worth of Elf Bar e-cigarettes in the past year. The company that makes Elf Bar is based in Shenzhen, China, and sells flavors including \u201cstrawberry mango\u201d and \u201clemon mint.\u201d",
      "Despite the continued availability of disposable e-cigarettes, the vaping rate among U.S. teens has fallen to a 10-year low of under 6%, according to federal figures released last year. Government health officials attribute the drop to more aggressive U.S. enforcement, including hundreds of warning letters sent to retail stores selling unauthorized vaping products.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.",
      "Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID\u2019s funding means Nyumbani\u2019s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s order seeks to review almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.",
      "For children at Nyumbani Children's Home, it's a life and death situation.",
      "As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers\u2019 faces.",
      "The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It's a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy \u2014 who has been looking after children here for 28 years \u2014 is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.",
      "\u201cWhen we started caring for them, they didn\u2019t look like they had life in them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\"",
      "When Nyumbani, which means \u201cHome\u201d in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.",
      "The 2003 inception of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR\u2019s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.",
      "\u201cUSAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,\u201d said Palakudy. \u201cWe put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.\u201d",
      "Over the last two decades, the U.S government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.",
      "USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.",
      "Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.",
      "According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.",
      "Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.",
      "The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.",
      "With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.",
      "\u201cThe future is uncertain,\u201d said Wamboye. \u201cThe Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.\u201d",
      "According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.",
      "One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. \u201cI had a very weak immune system,\" she said. \"This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.\u201d",
      "Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,\u201d she said.",
      "On average, the children's home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.",
      "Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it\u2019s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she said.",

      "A former surgeon is going on trial in France for the rape and sexual abuse of 299 victims over a period spanning more than three decades",
      "PARIS -- France is about to hold its largest-ever child sex abuse trial. While just one man is in the dock \u2014 a former surgeon accused of raping or sexual abusing 299 people, mostly child patients \u2014 activists hope the trial empowers other victims and helps expose other abusers long protected by societal taboos.",
      "Central to the trial are defendant Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec\u2019s chillingly detailed notebooks, which he used to document decades of sexual violence.",
      "Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial starting Monday in Vannes, in the Brittany region of northwestern France. He doesn't deny the charges, though he says he doesn't remember everything.",
      "Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time to undergo surgery at Le Scouarnec's hands.",
      "The trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos surrounding sexual abuse. That was highlighted recently during the trial that made Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of others, France\u2019s symbol of fight against sexual violence.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations see the trial as an opportunity to reaffirm that shame must change sides.",
      "\u201cIt should also mark a new step towards a justice system that listens and protects victims and firmly convicts aggressors,'' they said in a statement.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces up to 20 years in prison for rape, sexual assault and indecent acts committed with violence or surprise.",
      "The case began in 2017 when a 6-year-old neighbor denounced Le Scouarnec, who had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedopornographic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces and a young patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec has admitted child abuse dating back to 1985-1986, according to investigation documents. Some cases couldn't be prosecuted, because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine rapes and other abuses committed from 1989 to 2014 on 158 men and 141 women who were age 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to the investigation documents. His strategy was to disguise sexual violence as a medical act, targeting young patients who were less likely to recall what had happened.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the postoperation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital at the age of 9 in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot, but I didn\u2019t think something like that had happened to me during this operation.\u201d",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell as I left the lawyer\u2019s office,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\"",
      "She also described the emotional toll of the revelation.",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press doesn't name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec's lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper that his client would \u201canswer the judges' questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "The case could have come to light much earlier. Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child pornography and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time.",
      "Despite this, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the next year. Because of processing delays, the criminal record check requested by the Health Ministry at the time didn't include any mention of his past offenses.",
      "Even after being informed of his conviction, health authorities and hospital management didn't pursue disciplinary action.",
      "Some child protection groups joined the proceedings as civil parties.

      "Israeli and Hamas officials say they have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of dead hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners",
      "JERUSALEM -- JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli and Hamas officials said Tuesday they have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of dead hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, keeping their fragile ceasefire intact for at least a few more days.",
      "Israel has delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The militant group has said the delay is a \u201cserious violation\u201d of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase are not possible until they are freed.",
      "The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend.",
      "But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute during a visit to Cairo by a delegation headed by Khalil al-Hayya, a top political official in the group.",
      "The breakthrough appeared to clear the way for the return of the bodies of four more dead hostages and hundreds of additional prisoners scheduled to be released under the ceasefire.",
      "The prisoners previously slated for release \u201cwill be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners who were agreed to be handed over,\u201d along with the release of a new set of Palestinian prisoners, the Hamas statement said.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed an agreement to bring home the bodies in the coming days. He gave no further details.",
      "But Israeli media reports said the exchange could take place as soon as Wednesday. The Ynet news site said the Israeli bodies would be handed over to Egyptian authorities without any public ceremony.",
      "Hamas has released hostages, and the bodies of four dead hostages, in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have said the ceremonies were humiliating to the hostages, and Israel last weekend delayed the scheduled prisoner release in protest.",
      "The latest agreement would complete both sides' obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire \u2014 during which Hamas is returning 33 hostages \u2014 including eight bodies \u2014 in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "It also could clear the way for an expected visit by the White House\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region. Witkoff, who is expected in the region in the coming days, has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas are to be released and an end to the war is to be negotiated. The Phase 2 talks were supposed to begin weeks ago, but never did.",
      "The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of heavy fighting that erupted after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed some 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and decimated the territory's infrastructure and health system.

      "Yoon spoke at the Constitutional Court as it wrapped up arguments in his impeachment trial. The court is expected to rule by mid-March on whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate his presidential powers.",
      "The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon, a conservative, after his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law decree caused political turmoil, rattled its financial markets and hurt its international image. He has been separately arrested and indicted on rebellion charges in connection with his decree. If convicted, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "Yoon has denied any wrongdoing and blamed the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached many senior officials and slashed key parts of the government's budget bill, for the political crisis. During his marital law announcement, Yoon called the assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reason why I declared martial law was because of desperation as I could no longer neglect a do-or-die crisis facing this country,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cI tried to inform the people of these anti-state acts of wickedness by the mammoth opposition party and appealed to the people to stop it with intense surveillance and criticism.\u201d",

      "During the hearing, Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Chung-rai said that Yoon must be dismissed as he undermined the constitution by trying to seal the assembly and suppress its authority with armed troops. Jung also said Yoon's imposition of martial law disturbed public order because South Korea wasn't in an emergency that required such a drastic step.",
      "\u201cYoon Suk Yeol is still refusing to have self-reflection and soul-searching and repeating sophistry and crafty remarks that say his emergency martial law was a high-level act of governance,\u201d Jung said. \u201cWe should dismiss him as soon as possible to get the Republic of Korea back on track.\u201d",
      "Massive rallies by opponents and supporters of Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major South Korean cities. Whatever the Constitutional Court decides, experts say it will likely further polarize the country and intensify its conservative-liberal divide. If Yoon is formally thrown out of office, a national election must take place within two months to find his successor.",
      "During more than an hour of testimony Tuesday, Yoon said that he would push for political reforms and a constitutional revision to change the current presidential system if he regains his presidential powers. He also suggested stepping down before his single five-year term ends in 2027 to promote \u201cpolitical reform.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether and how Yoon\u2019s statement could affect the court's ruling.",
      "South Korea adopted the current system that limits a president to a single five-year term in 1987, following decades of military-backed dictatorships. After Yoon\u2019s martial law stunt, there have been calls to change it. Some favor a parliamentary Cabinet system, others want a U.S.-style setup in which a president can run for a second four-year term or a system in which a president and prime minister split key responsibilities."

      "Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility. Families from Central Asia flown to Panama and Costa Rica to await voluntary repatriation to their countries. Venezuelans from Guantanamo Bay handed off on a Honduran tarmac and returned to Caracas.",
      "It all sends the unmistakable message that trying to get to the U.S. border is no longer worth it. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has laid the groundwork to reverse the region\u2019s migration flow. And while the numbers remain modest, an outline of how the U.S. hopes to overcome limited detention space as it gears up its deportation machine is emerging.",
      "In its first month, the Trump administration has reached deals with Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama to act as stopovers or destinations for migrants expelled from the U.S. It has brokered deals with Venezuela to pick up its people in Texas, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and Honduras.",
      "But none of the agreements have been detailed for the public, raising concerns about evading international protections for refugees and asylum-seekers. Adam Isacson, a researcher with the Washington-based human rights advocacy organization WOLA, suspects many were little more than improvised \u201chandshake deals.\u201d",
      "They were requests made while Trump threatened tariffs and to take back the Panama Canal. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio moved through the region while U.S. foreign aid was suspended, bestowing exemptions when merited.",
      "Trump made deals during his first presidency with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to take in asylum-seekers, though only Mexico and Guatemala actually received them.",
      "But the agreements in his second term are more varied, ranging from Honduras letting Venezuelans get off a U.S. plane and board a Venezuelan one in its territory last week, to El Salvador offering to imprison deportees \u2014 and even U.S. citizen prisoners.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re being much more ambitious now,\u201d Isacson said. \u201cThe idea of sending people to be warehoused like goods, to deport them to third countries wasn\u2019t an issue\u201d in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The numbers remain relatively small, but images of deportees deplaning in shackles and deportees holding up signs asking for help in the Panama hotel where they\u2019re held are powerful.",
      "This is still a preliminary phase because Congress has not approved a new budget, Isacson said. \u201cWhile they\u2019re at that lowest level of resources they are doing all of the shock and awe possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is to scare them.\u201d",
      "Now the migration flow that is visible is of deportations and migrants boarding boats in Panama to take them south to Colombia rather than migrants riding trains north through Mexico or massing at the U.S. border.",
      "In just a month, Mexico has received more than 3,300 foreign deportees, who advocates say were from at least seven nationalities.",
      "A number of them carried unusual U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement documents that read: \u201cReason for transfer: removal. Name of new facility (immigration): MEXICO.\u201d They appear to have nothing to do with the Remain in Mexico program from Trump\u2019s first term that made asylum-seekers wait out the U.S. process from Mexico.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum has said little about Mexico\u2019s participation other than highlighting her administration\u2019s willingness to cooperate. The U.S. Department of State has praised Mexico for receiving deportation flights and for returning migrants from elsewhere to their countries.",
      "Farther south the numbers are smaller, but the imagery has been stronger.",
      "Panama, where more than 500,000 migrants passed en route to the U.S. border in 2023, suddenly became a bridge this month for U.S. efforts to deport asylum seekers. Nearly 300 U.S. deportees from 10 mostly Asian countries were held in a Panama City hotel. Some put signs to their windows that read \u201cHelp\u201d and \u201cWe are not save (sic) in our country.\u201d",
      "About one-third of those in the hotel who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were then sent to a remote camp back in the very jungle they had probably crossed in the other direction. One deportee in the camp told The Associated Press they were not informed of their rights and weren't told how long they would be in the camp, which concerned her because of its poor conditions.",
      "Similar flights landed in Costa Rica last week and they were sent to a remote facility that had also previously received migrants headed north.",
      "In addition to those flights, 50 to 75 migrants are moving south through Costa Rica on their own daily, according to Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s vice minister of the interior.",
      "He raised the possibility of Panama and Colombia getting involved to organize boat trips south for migrants, but neither of those governments has publicly confirmed their involvement. Panama and Costa Rica say U.N. agencies are assisting with the repatriations and that the U.S. government is paying.",
      "The International Organization for Migration said that it was helping authorities provide basic services and facilitating voluntary repatriations \u201cwhen it is safe to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith the old flow (south to north) the situation is pretty under control,\u201d Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said Thursday. \u201cThat shows that now the problem is coming in the opposite direction and we hope that can be managed in an orderly fashion.\u201d",
      "Even with the involvement of U.N. agencies, concerns abound about vulnerable migrants being passed from country to country and even sent back to countries they fled.",
      "Advocates worry the U.S. may be using third countries to deport migrants from countries where the U.S. may not have diplomatic relations or strained ones, to get around constraints in international law that are supposed to prevent people from being sent back to places they would not be safe.",
      "Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental legal services organization in Mexico, said recently a flight carrying Venezuelans from the United States to Venezuela made a stop in Cancun. But IMUMI wasn\u2019t able to speak with the migrants aboard directly to know if they wanted to try to request asylum in Mexico while in the country\u2019s territory.",
      "Isacson said among the Venezuelans sent back to that country have been people who deserted the armed forces, who would now be in the hands of the military. The risks could be even more dire for some migrants from Iran and Afghanistan.",
      "The region\u2019s governments are understandably sensitive about appearing to be aiding in Trump\u2019s deportation efforts, but Isacson said transparency will better shield them from those criticisms.",

    "story": [
      "The tiny island of Yonaguni on Japan\u2019s western frontier is too small for even a chain convenience store",
      "YONAGUNI, Japan -- This tiny island on Japan's western frontier has no chain convenience stores. Nature lovers can dive with hammerhead sharks and watch miniature horses graze on a hill.",
      "But the wooded mountain ranges now carry radar sites. A southern cattle ranch has been replaced with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force's Camp Yonaguni. Japan and its ally, the United States, hold joint military exercises here. Plans are underway to add a new missile unit and expand a small airport and port.",
      "All of the buildup has cemented the island as a front line in a potential clash over Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island that China claims as its own.",
      "\u201cAs a child, I was so proud of this westernmost border island,\u201d said Fumie Kano, an innkeeper on Yonaguni. \u201cBut recently, we are repeatedly told this place is dangerous, and I feel so sad.\u201d",
      "The militarization has been especially felt as the island's population shrinks. There are less than 1,500 local residents. Supporters say new servicemembers arriving are needed for the island's safety and struggling economy. Opponents like Kano say the military buildup is damaging the environment, making the island's economy dependent on the military and could provoke an attack.",
      "Yonaguni is only 110 kilometers (68 miles) east of Taiwan, around which China has bolstered military activity. Worried about a conflict, Japan has made a \u201csouthwestern shift\u201d in its military posture and accelerated defense buildup and spending around the front line.",
      "Missile units for PAC-3 interceptors have been deployed on Yonaguni and nearby Ishigaki and Miyako islands.",
      "Yonaguni residents find themselves at the center of the geopolitical tension. A recent government plan to deploy more missiles, possibly long-range, has caused unease about the future of the island, even among those who initially supported hosting troops.",
      "Kano, a Yonaguni native, recalls that officials and residents once wanted to improve the economy and environment through commercial exchanges with Taiwan by operating direct ferries between the islands. But that was set aside when a plan to host Japanese troops became an easier alternative to gain government subsidies and protection.",
      "Disagreement about the plan has divided the small community. Support for hosting Japanese troops carried in a 2015 referendum; that meant the island's fate would be largely decided by the central government\u2019s security policy.",
      "A year later a 160-member coast watch unit was set up to monitor Chinese military activity, with radars built on Mount Inbi and elsewhere. Now there are about 210 troops, including an electro-warfare unit. Servicemembers and their families account for one-fifth of the island\u2019s total population.",
      "The local economy largely depends on the servicemembers and their families who use local shops, schools and community services.",
      "There's worry on the island about the pace and extent of the militarization, says Kyoko Yamaguchi, a potter. \u201cEverything is pushed through in the name of the Taiwan emergency, and many feel this is too much.\u201d",
      "A nonfatal crash in October of a Japanese army tilt-rotor aircraft Osprey during a joint exercise with the U.S. military on the island also caused apprehension.",
      "Japan's air and maritime forces in Okinawa\u2019s prefectural capital of Naha are key to protecting the country's southwestern airspace and territorial waters.",
      "The Naha-based Southwestern Air Defense Force is the busiest of Japan\u2019s four regional air forces. In fiscal 2023, the force was scrambled 401 times, or 60% of the national total of 669, mostly against the Chinese, according to the Defense Ministry.",
      "Rear Adm. Takuhiro Hiragi, commander of Fleet Air Wing 5 of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, says his group's mission is to fly P-3C aircraft over the East China Sea near Okinawa and its remote islands, including Yonaguni, and the Japanese-controlled Senkaku island, which Beijing also claims.",
      "\u201cWe have to be mobile, quick and thorough to keep tabs in this region,\u201d Hiragi said, noting the presence of key sea lanes in the area, including those that China uses to navigate the Pacific Ocean. \u201cWe watch over their exercises, not only near Taiwan but wherever necessary.\u201d",
      "Defense officials say China has been accelerating its military activities in the area between Taiwan and Yonaguni.",
      "In August, a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane briefly violated Japanese airspace off the southern main island of Kyushu, prompting Japan\u2019s military to scramble fighter jets and warn the plane. A Chinese survey ship separately violated Japanese territorial waters off a southern island days later. In September, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and two destroyers sailed between Yonaguni and nearby Iriomote, entering a band of water just outside of Japan\u2019s territorial waters.",
      "Yonaguni fisherfolk, who closely monitor foreign vessels, have been among the first to see the growing Chinese military activity.",
      "In 2022, several ballistic missiles China fired as part of an exercise landed off Japan's southwestern waters following then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Taiwan visit in August. One of them landed just 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Yonaguni while more than 20 local fishing boats were operating.",
      "Though it caused no injuries or damage, the Chinese drills kept fisherfolk from operating for a week, Yonaguni fisheries association chief and town assembly member Shigenori Takenishi said. \u201cIt was an extremely dangerous exercise that really made us feel China's potential threat right next to us.\u201d",
      "Fear of a Taiwan war rekindles bitter memories here of the Battle of Okinawa, in which about 200,000 people, nearly half of them civilians, were killed. Historians say the army sacrificed Okinawa to defend Japan\u2019s mainland. Today Okinawa 's main island hosts more than half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan.",
      "\"Being at the center of this issue is very stressful for residents,\" said shopkeeper Takako Ueno. \u201cI don't want people to imagine this beautiful island turning into a battlefield.\u201d",
      "To keep that from happening Yonaguni needs to be fortified, says Mayor Kenichi Itokazu, a military buildup advocate who has campaigned for the deployment of more Japanese troops for decades.",
      "Some residents feel uneasy about their vulnerability, even amid the military buildup.",
      "A government evacuation plan last year showed moving 120,000 people from five remote islands, including Yonaguni, to Japan's main islands would take at least six days. Some question whether such an evacuation is even possible.",
      "Itokazu, the mayor, wants to build a shelter in the basement of a new town hall and to expand the Higawa port for evacuation by ship, a plan opposed by environmentalists who say there are rare marine species there.",
      "But there's skepticism from some.",
      "\u201cIt's absurd,\u201d Kano said of the evacuation plan, because all of Japan would be in danger if Okinawa is dragged into fighting. \u201cI just hope the money will be spent on policies that will help the people in Yonaguni live peacefully.\u201d",

      "Palestinian medics say at least six infants have died from hypothermia in the last two weeks in the Gaza Strip",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- At least six infants have died from hypothermia in the last two weeks in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of people are living in tent camps and war-damaged buildings during a fragile ceasefire, Palestinian medics said Tuesday.",
      "Temperatures have plunged in recent days. The coastal territory experiences cold, wet winters, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night and storms blowing in from the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Dr. Ahmed al-Farah, head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told The Associated Press that it received the body of a 2-month-old girl on Tuesday. He said another two infants were treated for frostbite, with one of them discharged later.",
      "Saeed Saleh, of the Patient's Friends Hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger have died from the cold over the last two weeks, including a 1-month-old who died on Monday. He said another child has been placed on a ventilator.",
      "Zaher al-Wahedi, head of the Gaza Health Ministry's records department, said it has recorded 15 deaths from hypothermia this winter, all of them children.",
      "The ceasefire that paused 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas militants has allowed a surge in humanitarian aid, mainly food, but residents say there are still shortages of blankets and warm clothing, and little wood available for fires.",
      "There's been no central electricity in Gaza since the first few days of the war, and fuel for generators is scarce. Many families huddle on damp sand or bare concrete.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly cold,\u201d Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for the United Nations children's agency, said earlier this month. \u201cI have no clue how people can sleep at night in their makeshift tents.\u201d",
      "Israel's military offensive, launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, was among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history. It pounded large areas of Gaza into rubble. The hundreds of thousands of people who have been able to return to northern Gaza under the ceasefire have settled wherever they can amid the ruins.",
      "The ceasefire's first phase will end on Saturday and may not be extended. If fighting resumes, the current flow of humanitarian aid is expected to drop dramatically.",
      "Even if the truce endures, it's unclear when anything in Gaza will be rebuilt. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction at over $50 billion, and it could take years just to clear the rubble.",
      "Israel blames the destruction on Hamas because the militants positioned tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure in residential areas.",
      "Hamas has accused Israel of delaying the entry of mobile homes and tents in violation of the ceasefire. Israel denies the allegations and accuses Hamas of violating the agreement. Israel held up the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners last weekend to protest Hamas' practice of parading hostages before crowds in public spectacles during their release.",
      "Hamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted around 250 hostages. Over 60 are still held in Gaza, around half believed to be dead.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many of those killed were militants. Israel says it killed over 17,000 fighters but has not provided evidence.",

      "Israel has delayed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas.",
      "The militant group has said the delay is a \u201cserious violation\u201d of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase are not possible until the Palestinians are freed.",
      "Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Hamas would hand over the bodies of four Israelis the next day.",
      "In exchange, Israel would release the Palestinian prisoners, as well as an unspecified number of women and minors detained since the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the conflict.",
      "An Israeli official confirmed that the bodies of four hostages were expected to be turned over but provided no further details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Israel and Hamas had already said on Tuesday that an agreement had been reached to return the bodies of the hostages, but no date had been announced.",
      "Hamas has released hostages, and the bodies of four dead hostages, in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds.",
      "Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have said the ceremonies were humiliating to the hostages, and Israel last weekend delayed the scheduled prisoner release in protest.",
      "The deadlock over the exchange had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend.",
      "The latest agreement would complete both sides\u2019 obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire \u2014 during which Hamas is returning 33 hostages, including eight bodies \u2014 in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "It also could clear the way for an expected visit this week by the White House\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region.",
      "Witkoff has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas are to be released and an end to the war is to be negotiated. The Phase 2 talks were supposed to begin weeks ago, but never did.",
      "The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of heavy fighting that erupted after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed some 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza\u2019s population and decimated the territory\u2019s infrastructure and health system. The Hamas-run Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but it says that over half of the dead have been women and children.",

      "\"After I saw the Puppy Mountain photo online, I tried to look up where it is. And then I realized that I have been to this place before. I thought it looked like a dog at that time too!\u201d",

      "LONDON -- A former leader of the Church of England is among several members of the clergy facing potential disciplinary action over the way the institution handled sexual abuse allegations, church officials said Tuesday.",
      "George Carey, who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1991 to 2002, resigned as a priest in December after media reports that he allowed the Rev. David Tudor, who had been banned over sexual abuse claims, to return to priesthood in the 1990s.",
      "The church\u2019s national safeguarding team said Tuesday it is seeking to bring disciplinary proceedings against Carey and nine other clergy over potential failures in a separate abuse case.",

      "Palestinians who returned to their homes in northern Gaza after the ceasefire began on Jan. 19 are still struggling to find shelter, food, water and other necessities",
      "BEIT LAHIYA, Gaza Strip -- When night falls over northern Gaza, much of the cityscape of collapsed buildings and piled wreckage turns pitch black. Living inside the ruins of their home, Rawia Tambora\u2019s young sons get afraid of the dark, so she turns on a flashlight and her phone\u2019s light to comfort them, for as long as the batteries last.",
      "Displaced for most of the 16-month-long war, Tambora is back in her house. But it is still a frustrating shell of a life, she says: There is no running water, electricity, heat or services, and no tools to clear the rubble around them.",
      "Nearly 600,000 Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza under the now month-old ceasefire in Gaza, according to the United Nations. After initial relief and joy at being back at their homes \u2014 even if damaged or destroyed \u2014 they now face the reality of living in the wreckage for the foreseeable future.",
      "\u201cSome people wish the war had never ended, feeling it would have been better to be killed,\u201d Tambora said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do long-term. My brain stopped planning for the future.\u201d",
      "The six-week ceasefire is due to end Saturday, and it\u2019s uncertain what will happen next. There are efforts to extend the calm as the next phase is negotiated. If fighting erupts again, those who returned to the north could find themselves once again in the middle of it.",
      "A report last week by the World Bank, U.N. and European Union estimated it will cost some $53 billion to rebuild Gaza after entire neighborhoods were decimated by Israel\u2019s bombardment and offensives against Hamas militants. At the moment, there is almost no capacity or funding to start significant rebuilding.",
      "A priority is making Gaza immediately livable. Earlier in February, Hamas threatened to hold up hostage releases unless more tents and temporary shelters were allowed into Gaza. It then reversed and accelerated hostage releases after Israel agreed to let in mobile homes and construction equipment.",
      "Humanitarian agencies have stepped up services, setting up free kitchens and water delivery stations, and distributing tents and tarps to hundreds of thousands across Gaza, according to the U.N.",
      "President Donald Trump turned up the pressure by calling for the entire population of Gaza to be removed permanently so the U.S. can take over the territory and redevelop it for others. Rejecting the proposal, Palestinians say they want help to rebuild for themselves.",
      "Gaza City\u2019s municipality started fixing some water lines and clearing rubble from streets, said a spokesperson, Asem Alnabih. But it lacks heavy equipment. Only a few of its 40 bulldozers and five dump trucks still work, he said. Gaza is filled with over 50 million tons of rubble that would take 100 trucks working at full capacity over 15 years to clear away, the U.N. estimates.",
      "Tambora\u2019s house in the northern town of Beit Lahiya was destroyed by an airstrike early in the war, so she and her family lived in the nearby Indonesian Hospital, where she worked as a nurse.",
      "After the ceasefire, they moved back into the only room in her house that was semi-intact. The ceiling is partially collapsed, the walls are cracked; the surviving fridge and sink are useless with no water or electricity. They stack their sheets and blankets in a corner.",
      "Tambora said her 12-year-old son lugs heavy containers of water twice a day from distribution stations. They also have to find firewood for cooking. The influx of aid means there is food in the markets and prices went down, but it remains expensive, she said.",
      "With the Indonesian Hospital too damaged to function, Tambora walks an hour each day to work at the Kamal Adwan Hospital. She charges her and her husband\u2019s phones using the hospital generator.",
      "Many of Tambora\u2019s relatives returned to find nothing left of their homes, so they live in tents on or next to the rubble that gets blown away by winter winds or flooded during rains, she said.",
      "Asmaa Dwaima and her family returned to Gaza City but had to rent an apartment because their home in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood was destroyed. It was only weeks after returning that she went to visit their four-story house, now a pile of flattened and burned wreckage.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t come here because I was afraid. I had an image of my house in my mind \u2014 its beauty, and warmth. ... I was afraid to face this truth,\u201d the 25-year-old dentist said. \u201cThey don\u2019t just destroy stone, they are destroying us and our identity.\u201d",
      "Her family had to rebuild the house once before, when it was leveled by airstrikes during a round of fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2014, she said. For the time being, they have no means to rebuild now.",
      "\u201cWe need to remove the rubble because we want to pull out clothes and some of our belongings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need heavy equipment \u2026 There are no bricks or other construction tools and, if available, it\u2019s extremely expensive.\u201d",
      "Tess Ingram, a spokesperson with UNICEF who visited northern Gaza since the ceasefire, said the families she met are \u201cgrieving the lives that they used to live as they begin to rebuild.\u201d",

      "Huda Skaik, a 20-year-old student, is sharing a room with her three siblings and parents at her grandparents\u2019 house in Gaza City. It\u2019s an improvement from life in the tent camps of central Gaza where they were displaced for much of the war, she said. There, they had to live among strangers, and their tent was washed away by rain. At least here they have walls and are with family, she said.",
      "Before the war interrupted, Skaik had just started studying English literature at Gaza\u2019s Islamic University. She is now enrolled in online classes the university is organizing. But the internet is feeble, and her electricity relies on solar panels that don\u2019t always work.",
      "\u201cThe worst part is that we\u2019re just now grasping that we lost it all,\u201d she said. \u201cThe destruction is massive, but I\u2019m trying to remain positive.\u201d ___",

      "Syria faces major challenges, from rebuilding an economy and war-wrecked infrastructure, to setting up a new constitution and justice mechanisms for those accused of war crimes.",
      "Although incidents of revenge and collective punishment have been far less widespread than expected, many in Syria's minority communities \u2014 including Kurds, Christians, Druze and members of Assad's Alawite sect \u2014 are concerned for their future and not yet convinced by the new rulers' promises of inclusive governance. HTS was formerly affiliated with al-Qaida, although it broke ties and al-Sharaa has since preached coexistence.",
      "The organizers of the Damascus conference said all of Syria's communities were invited. Women and members of minority religious communities were among the attendees on Tuesday. The gathering is meant to come up with nonbinding recommendations on the country's interim rules ahead of the drafting of a new constitution and formation of a new government.",

      "Shoigu's visit, the first stop in a five-day Asia tour that also includes Malaysia, comes after Indonesia \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country and Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy \u2014 was admitted as full member to the BRICS bloc of developing economies, an alliance where Russia is one of the founding members.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- An Israeli hostage freed in the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas said Tuesday that faith sustained her in captivity and that she used the few means that were available to observe Judaism.",
      "In what appeared to be the first media interview by a captive freed in this ceasefire, Agam Berger told Israeli public radio Reshet Bet that she was moved around multiple times during the nearly 16 months she was held in the Gaza Strip. She said she was held in tunnels and apartments with other female captives, with the conditions varying depending on where she was held and who was guarding her.",
      "\u201cWe had food and conditions that for the most part were OK when you know what could have been,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you think about it, they aren\u2019t conditions for a human.\u201d",
      "Berger was a military spotter who was captured along with other female surveillance soldiers on Oct. 7, 2023, from a base in southern Israel. She was freed last month as part of the ceasefire pausing the 15-month war.",
      "Other freed captives have recounted through their families being starved, chained and abused. And Berger said her conditions worsened after two military raids early last year rescued hostages, making her captors more anxious.",
      "Hamas has released 25 living hostages and the remains of four others as part of the deal. On Tuesday, mourners held a funeral for Oded Lifshitz, who at 83 at the time of the abduction was one of the oldest hostages taken captive in Hamas' attack, which sparked the war in Gaza. Israel says he was killed in captivity.",
      "Berger's family has said since her release that she tried to observe Judaism even in captivity. In January 2024, Berger said her captors brought her and other hostages two Jewish prayer books, as well as other objects left behind by Israeli soldiers, such as an Israeli newspaper and military maps.",
      "She spent her first Hannukah in captivity in December 2023, held in a tunnel with four other captives. She said they asked their captors for candles to mark the holiday when faithful light a menorah for eight nights. They were brought one.",
      "She kept track of the date through a clock given to one of her fellow captives until that was taken away months before her release when she said she had a harder time following Jewish holidays unless she caught a glimpse of Israeli news.",
      "For much of the time, Berger, 20, was given two meals a day, pita and rice. In her little access to news media, she learned of developments in the war, including the debate in Israel over what price to pay for the hostages\u2019 release. She said it was demoralizing to learn there were some in government unwilling to make big concessions to free the captives.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like saying that our lives aren\u2019t worth enough,\u201d she said.",
      "Israel is freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages.",
      "Berger said she was told the night before her release last month that she would be freed and a sleepless night followed. Palestinian women came to prepare her in the morning and dressed her in the dark green military fatigues she would appear in on a stage later that day.",
      "They told her she would be made to participate in an orchestrated release ceremony with a large crowd, and she was forced to write a thank-you note to her captors.",
      "\u201cI just tried to invent things and said (to myself) 'I don't care. I am going home today,'\u201d she said.",
      "She was told she couldn\u2019t take with her any of the meager possessions she had gathered while in captivity. She left behind notebooks full of sketches she had made with a fellow captive, cards she had written for the birthdays of relatives she had missed and the prayer book.",

      "It's all unfolding as billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk is tearing through federal agencies with his Department of Government Efficiency firing thousands of workers nationwide, and angry voters are starting to confront lawmakers at town hall meetings back home.",
      "\u201cWhile we fully support efforts to rein in wasteful spending and deliver on President Trump's agenda, it is imperative that we do not slash programs that support American communities across our nation,\u201d wrote Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, and several other GOP lawmakers in the Congressional Hispanic Conference.",
      "Democrats in the House and the Senate are vowing to fight the whole process. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York was planning to gather lawmakers on the Capitol steps in protest during Tuesday\u2019s session.",
      "\u201cThis is not what people want,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., during a rules debate ahead of planned votes.",
      "\u201cWe all know that trickle-down economics,\u201d he said about the 2017 tax breaks that flowed mainly to the wealthy, \u201cdon\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Trump has signaled a preference for the \u201cbig\u201d bill but also appears to enjoy a competition between the House and the Senate, lawmakers said, as he pits the Republicans against each other to see which version will emerge on a path toward approval.",
      "Senate Republicans, wary that Johnson can lift his bill over the finish line, launched their own scaled-back $340 billion package last week. It\u2019s focused on sending Trump money his administration needs for its deportation and border security agenda now, with plans to tackle the tax cuts separately later this year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m holding my breath. I\u2019m crossing my fingers,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who said he is rooting for the House's approach as the better option. \"I think a one-shot is their best opportunity.\u201d",
      "Johnson, whose party lost seats in last November\u2019s election, commands one of the thinnest majorities in modern history, which means he must keep almost every Republican in line or risk losing the vote.",
      "Already, several lawmakers have objected to the package either because it cuts too much or because it doesn't cut enough.",
      "The most conservative Republicans warn it will pile onto the nation\u2019s $36 trillion debt load, because the cost of the tax breaks, at least $4.5 trillion over the decade, outweighs the $2 trillion in spending cuts to government programs.",
      "More moderate Republican lawmakers worry that the enormous budget cuts being eyed \u2014 some $880 billion to the committee that handles health care spending, including Medicaid, for example, or $230 billion to the agriculture committee that funds food stamps \u2014 will be too harmful to their constituents back home.",
      "GOP leaders are trying to convince lawmakers that the details will be debated in the weeks to come and that this week's vote is just a first step.",
      "The budget is being compiled during a lengthy process that first sends instructions to the various House and Senate committees, which will then have several weeks to devise more detailed plans for additional debate and votes.",
      "\u201cThe committees need time to go work to find savings,\" said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. \"But we can\u2019t even get to that if we don\u2019t get through the budget. So, we\u2019ve got to get the first step done later this week.\u201d",
      "Ten House GOP chairmen of the committees involved issued a joint statement in a show of force to push the package forward.",
      "\u201cThe House\u2019s \u2018one big beautiful bill\u2019 delivers on the entirety of President Trump\u2019s policy agenda,\u201d they wrote in a letter obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cWe must meet this historic moment with the bold action it requires.\u201d",
      "Rep. Jodey Arrington, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters he recognizes the tension between Republicans who want more cuts and those from politically competitive districts who \u201chave a higher level of sensitivity to some of the spending reforms.\"",
      "Arrington said with economic growth assumptions, from 1.8% as projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to 2.6% as projected by House Republicans, the package would generate about $2.6 trillion in savings over 10 years and would ensure the plan helps reduce the deficit.",
      "Some fiscal advocacy groups view the GOP\u2019s economic projections as overly optimistic.",

      "Opening statements are scheduled to begin in the trial of a Texas pipeline company's lawsuit against Greenpeace",
      "MANDAN, N.D. -- A Texas pipeline company's lawsuit seeking potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from Greenpeace was set to advance with opening statements Wednesday in a trial the environmental organization calls an effort to silence critics of the oil industry.",
      "Jury selection took place earlier in the week and the estimated five-week trial now will get underway in Mandan, North Dakota.",
      "The lawsuit stems from protests in 2016 and 2017 against the Dakota Access oil pipeline and its controversial Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline was completed in 2017.",
      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access allege trespass, nuisance, defamation and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International and its American branch, Greenpeace USA. The lawsuit also names the group\u2019s funding arm, Greenpeace Fund Inc.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Greenpeace tried to delay construction of the pipeline, defamed the companies behind it, and coordinated trespassing, vandalism and violence by pipeline protesters.",
      "The Greenpeace defendants deny the allegations.",
      "Greenpeace says the lawsuit is going after $300 million, citing a figure from a previous federal case. The lawsuit complaint asks for damages in an amount to be proved at trial.",
      "Greenpeace representatives say the case is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to bring visibility around a fight that will have major implications for the future of the First Amendment because those who bring these types of lawsuits, they want these fights to remain silent and invisible,\u201d said Senior Legal Adviser Deepa Padmanabha.",
      "The lawsuit is about Greenpeace not following the law, not about free speech, Energy Transfer spokesperson Vicki Granado has said previously.",
      "\u201cWe support the rights of all Americans to express their opinions and lawfully protest. However, when it is not done in accordance with our laws, we have a legal system to deal with that,\u201d she said.",
      "The company filed a similar case in federal court in 2017, which a judge dismissed in 2019. Energy Transfer subsequently filed the lawsuit now at trial in state court.",

      "More than mere containers, humidors, some true works of art in wood, regulate humidity and temperature, and can cost thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cOther countries produce humidors, but we create them with passion, just like in the old days,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Mor\u00e1n Lipis, of Humidores Clave, one of several workshops showing off their creations at Cuba\u2019s annual cigar trade fair that runs through Friday in Havana.",
      "Humidor prices range from $200 for basic 25-cigar models to thousands for exclusive pieces. Humidores Clave, for example, showcased a carved black and white humidor valued at $2,000. Last year\u2019s festival gala featured a humidor auction \u2014 with their respective cigars \u2014 that raised a staggering $19.3 million, highlighting the high value placed on these luxury items.",
      "Some of the humidors on display at this year's fair resembled iconic buildings, adorned with Cuban flags, intricate train designs, or striking abstract patterns. One particularly eye-catching humidor emulated a shark\u2019s fin, soaring over a meter in height. Innovation was also evident, with features like remote-controlled trunks and hidden compartments.",
      "Considered as some of the world\u2019s finest, Cuban cigars have solidified their position in the premium tobacco market.",

    "story": [
      "The White House says its officials \"will determine\" which news outlets cover President Donald Trump",
      "The White House said Tuesday that its officials \u201cwill determine\u201d which news outlets can regularly cover President Donald Trump up close \u2014 a sharp break from a century of tradition in which a pool of independently chosen news organizations go where the chief executive does and hold him accountable on behalf of regular Americans.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the changes would rotate traditional outlets from the group and include some streaming services. Leavitt cast the change as a modernization of the press pool, saying the move would be more inclusive and restore \u201caccess back to the American people\u201d who elected Trump. But media experts said the move raised troubling First Amendment issues because the president is choosing who covers him.",
      "\"The White House press team, in this administration, will determine who gets to enjoy the very privileged and limited access in spaces such as Air Force One and the Oval Office,\" Leavitt said at a daily briefing. She added at another point: \u201cA select group of D.C.-based journalists should no longer have a monopoly of press access at the White House.\u201d",
      "Leavitt said the White House will \u201cdouble down\u201d on its decision to bar The Associated Press from many presidential events, a departure from the time-tested and sometimes contentious practice for more than a century of a pool of journalists from every platform sharing the presidents' words and activities with news outlets and congressional offices that can't attend the close-quarter events. Traditionally, the members of the pool decide who goes in small spaces such as the Oval Office and Air Force One.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beyond time that the White House press operation reflects the media habits of the American people in 2025, not 1925,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "The change said one expert on presidents and the press, \u201cis a dangerous move for democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201dIt means the president can pick and choose who covers the executive branch, ignoring the fact that it is the American people who through their taxes pay for the running of the White House, the president\u2019s travels and the press secretary\u2019s salary,\u201d Jon Marshall, a media history professor at Northwestern University and author of \u201cClash: Presidents and the Press in Times of Crisis.\u201d",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, said the organization consistently expands its membership and pool rotations to facilitate the inclusion of new and emerging outlets.",
      "\u201cThis move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States. It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president,\u201d Daniels said in a statement. \u201cIn a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.\"",
      "Leavitt spoke a day after a federal judge refused to immediately order the White House to restore the AP's access to many presidential events. The news outlet, citing the First Amendment, sued Leavitt and two other White House officials for barring the AP from some presidential events over its refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America\u201d as Trump ordered. AP has said its style would retain the \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d name but also would note Trump's decision.",
      "U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden said said the AP had not demonstrated it had suffered irreparable harm. But he urged the Trump administration to reconsider its two-week-old ban, saying that case law in the circuit \u201cis uniformly unhelpful to the White House.\u201d",
      "McFadden\u2019s decision was only for the moment, however. He told attorneys for the Trump administration and the AP that the issue required more exploration before ruling. Another hearing was scheduled for late March.",
      "The AP Stylebook is used by international audiences as well as those within the United States. The AP has said that its guidance was offered to promote clarity.",
      "Another Trump executive order to change the name of the United States\u2019 largest mountain back to Mount McKinley from Denali is being recognized by the AP Stylebook. Trump has the authority to do so because the mountain is completely within the country he oversees, AP has said."

      "GABORONE, Botswana -- The Botswana government signed a new diamond sales agreement crucial to its economy with the De Beers mining company on Tuesday after seven years of negotiations.",
      "The deal gives the government an increasing share of diamond sales through the Debswana company \u2014 its joint venture with De Beers, a subsidiary of Anglo American.",
      "Botswana, a sparsely populated and arid country in southern Africa, is the biggest producer of diamonds by value and the second biggest by volume behind Russia. Diamonds account for around 80% of Botswana's exports and a quarter of its GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund.",
      "But a decline in the price and demand for mined diamonds has badly hampered the Botswana economy and was a central issue in a national election last year. The party that had ruled for 58 years since independence from the British was voted out in a stunning result that was largely a reaction to new economic hardships related to the downturn in the diamond industry.",
      "The new 10-year sales agreement gives the government a 30% share of Debswana's sales up from 25% for the first five years and a 40% share for the following five years. There is an option for a five-year extension to the agreement, the two parties said, when the share of sales will be 50-50.",
      "In return, De Beers was awarded a 25-year extension to its mining licenses in Botswana from 2029 until 2054.",
      "The two parties had broadly agreed terms for the deal in 2023 but had yet to sign. Finalizing the agreement was a priority for new Botswana President Duma Boko, who came into office after the October election.",

      "Chat Cola \u2014 its red tin and sweeping white script bearing remarkable resemblance to the iconic American soft drink's logo \u2014 has seen its products explode in popularity across the occupied West Bank in the past year as Palestinian consumers, angry at America\u2019s steadfast support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, protest with their pocketbooks.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to be caught drinking Coke,\u201d said Mad Asaad, 21, a worker at the bakery-cafe chain Croissant House in the West Bank city of Ramallah, which stopped selling Coke after the war erupted. \u201cEveryone drinks Chat now. It\u2019s sending a message.\u201d",
      "Since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered Israel's devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian-led boycott movement against companies perceived as supportive of Israel gained momentum across the Middle East, where the usual American corporate targets like McDonald\u2019s, KFC and Starbucks saw sales slide last year.",
      "Here in the West Bank, the boycott has shuttered two KFC branches in Ramallah. But the most noticeable expression of consumer outrage has been the sudden ubiquity of Chat Cola as shopkeepers relegate Coke cans to the bottom shelf \u2014 or pull them altogether.",
      "\u201cWhen people started to boycott, they became aware that Chat existed,\u201d Fahed Arar, general manager of Chat Cola, told The Associated Press from the giant red-painted factory, nestled in the hilly West Bank town of Salfit. \u201cI'm proud to have created a product that matches that of a global company.\"",
      "With the \u201cbuy local\u201d movement burgeoning during the war, Chat Cola said its sales in the West Bank surged more than 40% last year, compared to 2023.",
      "While the companies said they had no available statistics on their command of the local market due to the difficulties of data collection in wartime, anecdotal evidence suggests Chat Cola is clawing at some of Coca-Cola\u2019s market share.",
      "\u201cChat used to be a specialty product, but from what we\u2019ve seen, it dominates the market,\u201d said Abdulqader Azeez Hassan, 25, the owner of a supermarket in Salfit that boasts fridges full of the fizzy drinks.",
      "But workers at Coca-Cola's franchise in the West Bank, the National Beverage Company, are all Palestinian, and a boycott affects them, too, said its general manager, Imad Hindi.",
      "He declined to elaborate on the business impact of the boycott, suggesting it can't be untangled from the effects of the West Bank's economic free-fall and intensified Israeli security controls that have multiplied shipping times and costs for Palestinian companies during the war.",
      "The Coca-Cola Company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Whether or not the movement brings lasting consequences, it does reflect an upsurge of political consciousness, said Salah Hussein, head of the Ramallah Chamber of Commerce.",
      "\u201cIt's the first time we've ever seen a boycott to this extent,\u201d Hussein said, noting how institutions like the prominent Birzeit University near Ramallah canceled their Coke orders. \u201cAfter Oct. 7, everything changed. And after Trump, everything will continue to change.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which he rephrased last week as a recommendation, has further inflamed anti-American sentiment around the region.",
      "With orders pouring in not only from Lebanon and Yemen but also the United States and Europe, the company has its sights set on the international market, said PR manager Ahmad Hammad.",
      "Hired to help Chat Cola cash in on combustible emotions created by the war, Hammad has rebranded what began in 2019 as a niche mom-and-pop operation.",
      "\u201cWe had to take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d he said of the company's new \u201cPalestinian taste\u201d logo and national flag-hued merchandise.",
      "In its scramble to satisfy demand, Chat Cola is opening a second production site in neighboring Jordan. It rolled out new candy-colored flavors, like blueberry, strawberry and green apple.",
      "At the steamy plant in Salfit, recent college graduates in lab coats said that they took pains to produce a carbonated beverage that could sell on its taste, not just a customer\u2019s sense of solidarity with the Palestinians.",
      "\u201cQuality has been a problem with local Palestinian products before,\u201d said Hanna al-Ahmad, 32, the head of quality control for Chat Cola, shouting to be heard over the whir of machines squirting caramel-colored elixir into scores of small cans that then whizzed down assembly lines. \u201cIf it\u2019s not good quality, the boycott won\u2019t stick.\"",
      "Chat Cola worked with chemists in France to produce the flavor, which is almost indistinguishable from Coke\u2019s \u2014 just like its packaging. That's the case for several flavors: Squint at Chat's lemon-lime soda and you might mistake it for a can of Sprite.",
      "In 2020, the Ramallah-based National Beverage Company sued Chat Cola for copyright infringement in Palestinian court, contending that Chat had imitated Coke's designs for multiple drinks. The court ultimately sided with Chat Cola, determining there were enough subtle differences in the can designs that it didn't violate copyright law.",
      "In the Salfit warehouse, drivers loaded \u201cfamily size\u201d packages of soda into trucks bound not only for the West Bank but also for Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities in Israel. Staffers said that Chat soda sales in Israel's predominantly Arab cities jumped 25% last year. To broaden its appeal in Israel, Chat Cola secured kosher certification after a Jewish rabbi's thorough inspection of the facility.",
      "Still, critics of the Palestinians-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, say that its main objective \u2014 to isolate Israel economically for its occupation of Palestinian lands \u2014 only exacerbates the conflict.",
      "\u201cBDS and similar actions drive communities apart, they don\u2019t help to bring people together,\u201d said Vlad Khaykin, the executive vice president of social impact and partnerships in North America for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization. \u201cThe kind of rhetoric being embraced by the BDS movement to justify the boycott of Israel is really quite dangerous.\u201d",
      "While Chat Cola goes out of its way to avoid buying from Israel \u2014 sourcing ingredients and materials from France, Italy and Kuwait \u2014 it can't avoid the circumstances of Israeli occupation, in which Israel dominates the Palestinian economy, controls borders, imports and more.",
      "Deliveries of raw materials to Chat Cola\u2019s West Bank factory get hit with a 35% import tax \u2014 half of which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians. The general manager, Arar, said his company's success depends far more on Israeli bureaucratic goodwill than nationalist fervor.",
      "For nearly a month last fall, Israeli authorities detained Chat's aluminum shipments from Jordan at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, forcing part of the factory to shut down and costing the company tens of thousands of dollars.",

      "The extra week in the quarter was not included in the same-store sales results.",
      "\u201cThe fact that US comparable sales are back in the black after declining for eight quarters or two years is a very clear win for Home Depot, and it suggests that the home improvement market as a whole might finally be reaching the nadir of its more sluggish performance,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, wrote Tuesday.",

      "Home improvement retailers like Home Depot have contended with homeowners putting off bigger projects due to higher borrowing costs and lingering concerns about inflation.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last month as rising mortgage rates and prices put off many would-be homebuyers despite a wider selection of properties on the market.",

    "story": [
      "No other wealthy donor has dedicated as much money to such a wide range of nursing programs as Bill Conway, the 75-year-old co-founder of the private equity giant the Carlyle Group, and his late wife, Joanne Barkett Conway, who died in January, 2024",
      "Bill Conway didn\u2019t start out wanting to make a big impact on the nursing profession.",
      "In 2011, the financier announced he would give away $1 billion to create jobs for the poor and asked the public to send him ideas. In came around 2,500 suggestions. Most were sob stories, but some people had good ideas, he says, and several suggested backing bachelor\u2019s degree nursing programs.",
      "\u201cIt was along the lines of: If we support potential students to get a nursing degree, then they\u2019ll always be able to get a job and take care of themselves, their families, and the rest of us,\u201d remembers Conway. \u201cMy wife and I thought that sounded pretty good.\u201d",
      "Currently, private giving for the nursing profession accounts for only one cent of every dollar given for health care, according to a report from the foundation arm of the American Nurses Association. And giving to nursing isn\u2019t a popular cause among most wealthy donors.",
      "But there are exceptions. Leonard Lauder has given $177 million to nursing schools at the University of Pennsylvania and  Hunter College,  and Mark and Robyn Jones donated $100 million to expand Montana State University\u2019s nursing program. Yet no other wealthy donor has dedicated as much money to such a wide range of nursing programs as Conway, the 75-year-old co-founder of the private equity giant the Carlyle Group, and his late wife, Joanne Barkett Conway, who died in January, 2024.",
      "Those efforts are destined to grow, with Conway only about a third of the way toward his target of giving $1 billion to nursing. So far, he has donated $325.6 million to support student aid, new buildings, efforts to recruit and retain faculty, and more at 22 nursing schools in the Eastern and mid-Atlantic regions. He also is backing a pediatric nursing program at Children\u2019s National Hospital, in Washington, D.C.",
      "Over the past decade, that money has helped produce more than 7,000 nurses. Now, he says, he wants to take his support of nursing programs nationwide.",
      "\u201cI expect that of most of the money I leave to charity will go to continuing this mission,\u201d says Conway, whose net worth Forbes estimates at $4 billion. \u201cI see that we\u2019re starting to make a difference in some places, and I\u2019d like to make more of a difference over time.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s nursing shortage is misunderstood, says Linda Aiken, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s nursing school. The public hears about a nursing shortage and thinks there are not enough nurses or people who want to become nurses, but the problem is more complicated than that, she says.",
      "While nurses are the largest group of health care professionals and the backbone of health care, their contributions are frequently undervalued by health care systems, and many are underpaid and experience a higher rate of burnout than other medical professionals, according to Aiken and other nursing experts.",
      "Many more people want to become nurses than there are spots available in nursing schools because there are not enough nursing professors. As a result, nursing schools can accept few of the students who apply.",
      "In 2022, roughly 78,000 qualified applicants were not accepted to U.S. nursing schools because of insufficient faculty, classrooms and lab space, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. There are also about 2,000 full-time nursing faculty vacancies at U.S. nursing schools, says Katie Fioravanti, director of the foundation arm of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.",
      "\u201cAttracting people to teach nursing is challenging because they can make considerably higher salaries in actual practice,\u201d Fioravanti says. \u201cBy the time they get a Ph.D. and go back to become a nursing faculty member or a dean, they\u2019re already in their 50s, and that means they retire sooner.\u201d",
      "The Conways didn\u2019t know much about nursing when they decided to donate to the field. With the help of a colleague whose wife was a nurse, the couple began learning about the profession and university nursing programs.",
      "They first gave money to support tuition at nursing schools, largely at the behest of Joanne Conway, a onetime scholarship student, and because her husband wanted to ensure students graduated without the burden of college debt.",
      "\u201cI wanted them to be free to be the kind of nurse they wanted to be,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they wanted to work in an inner-city clinic and not make too much money or if they wanted to work someplace where they were going to make a lot of money, I wanted them to do what they wanted.\u201d",
      "Gradually, Conway supported building projects that expanded classroom and lab space, the hiring of additional faculty, and scholarships for nurses seeking advanced degrees to teach.",
      "His giving process has mostly stayed the same. When Conway is considering a first-time gift, he and the head of his Bedford Falls Foundation, Elizabeth Carrott Minnigh, visit nursing schools, meet with deans and ask for data related to graduation rates and nursing licenses.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to see if it\u2019s going to be a partnership where we could fund a reasonably large number of students who would actually get to the finish line without debt that will cripple them in their career choices and opportunities,\u201d Carrott Minnigh says.",
      "Conway and Carrott Minnigh then visit the schools regularly to talk to deans, faculty and students about any challenges they might be facing. These conversations have often translated into more targeted grants.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a one-size-fits-all grant-making process,\u201d Carrott Minnigh says. \u201cIt\u2019s all customized to what we hear at the schools about what they want and need.\u201d",
      "For example, in 2013, the Conways gave $4 million to Catholic University\u2019s nursing school. Since then, their giving to the institution \u2014 now named the Conway School of Nursing \u2014 has grown to more than $64 million, expanding full scholarships, largely paying for a new nursing school building and backing graduate nursing programs. The Conways also have supported mentoring efforts and a review course to prepare students for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses.",
      "\u201cCalling his donations transformational is not saying enough,\u201d says Marie Nolan, dean of Catholic\u2019s nursing school.",
      "Over the past decade, Conway has also significantly funded the University of Virginia\u2019s nursing school. In 2013, he gave $5 million for nursing scholarships and over time has donated nearly $50 million to expand scholarships for undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, support nurses who want to become professors, and help people pivot into nursing.",
      "UVA\u2019s nursing school\u2019s dean, Marianne Baernholdt, says Conway\u2019s extensive giving to nursing programs, and particularly his efforts to help nursing students early in their education, is rare among wealthy donors.",
      "\u201cThere are a couple of nursing schools that got big sums to increase their advanced practice nursing programs,\u201d Baernholdt says. \u201cBut very few invest in pre-licensure, which is what the Conways have done.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Sales of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chip Blackwell will be top of mind when the company releases its latest financial results Wednesday, with analysts eyeing future demand amid a Chinese upstart's claim that it can train competitive AI models using far fewer resources.",
      "Wall Street expects Nvidia to report fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share on revenue of $38.08 billion, according to FactSet. The company\u2019s net income is expected to reach $19.58 billion.",
      "What happens with Nvidia matters for the entire U.S. stock market. The chip company has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street, which means the stock\u2019s movement carries more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than every company except Apple. The tech giant, based in Santa Clara, California, is now worth over $3 trillion.",
      "Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the AI boom have been a major reason the S&P 500 has climbed to record after record recently, with the latest coming last week. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about stubbornly high inflation and possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump.",
      "Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total return last year. None of the other 499 companies in the index came close. If Nvidia can\u2019t keep up its momentum, particularly when critics say its stock price has climbed too much and too quickly, Americans holding S&P 500 index funds in their 401(k) and other investing accounts could be set for pain.",
      "The fourth-quarter earnings will be the company\u2019s first report since Chinese company DeepSeek boasted it had developed a large language model that could compete with ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but was more cost-effective in its use of Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data.",

    "story": [
      "It wasn\u2019t too long ago that many colleges weren\u2019t even selling alcoholic beverages at sporting events on campus",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Missy Vraney and Kristin Westphal didn't go to Marquette. Neither did any of their relatives. Yet their family tradition of attending Golden Eagles basketball games spans generations.",
      "\u201cWhenever our uncle couldn\u2019t go, our dad would take one of us and just kind of alternate,\u201d Vraney recalls.",
      "They\u2019re still supporting the school regularly \u2014 just in beer money rather than tuition fees. It happens every time they buy a Marquette Golden Ale before heading to the Fiserv Forum stands.",
      "This marks the first season since Marquette entered a partnership with Milwaukee-based Third Space Brewing to sell Marquette Golden Ale \u2014 the school\u2019s officially licensed and co-branded craft beer \u2014 at Golden Eagles sporting events as well as in Third Space outlets and area groceries. As part of the deal, 15% of the revenues go back to Marquette.",
      "\u201cPeople are extremely excited about it,\u201d said Andy Gehl, the co-founder and president of Third Space Brewing. \u201cPeople love drinking beer with their favorite school, their favorite sports team\u2019s logo on it. That\u2019s No. 1. Also, they want to support businesses that support their university, and vice versa.\u201d",
      "This has become the latest fund-raising trend for college athletics.",
      "Learfield, which manages sports sponsorships for over 160 universities and licensing agreements for nearly 800 colleges, says that 93 of its schools had licensing deals for alcoholic beverages for the first six months of the current fiscal year. That\u2019s a 57.6% rise from fiscal year 2023, when 59 schools had deals for their own signature alcoholic beverage.",
      "The number of Learfield schools with licensing deals specifically with craft beers has more than doubled in that time \u2013 from 16 in 2023 to 36 this year.",
      "Cory Moss, Learfield\u2019s president of brand management and marketing, acknowledges he would have been surprised by this kind of growth four or five years ago. Then he started noticing more interest from the schools themselves and from various local craft breweries wanting to establish partnerships.",
      "\u201cWhen schools got really behind it and the craft industry really started to take it seriously, that\u2019s when it really started to grow,\u201d Moss said. \u201cAnd that growth hasn\u2019t been surprising.\u201d",
      "It represents a major change in the college sports landscape, considering how many schools weren\u2019t even selling alcoholic beverages at their athletic events not so long ago. The Southeastern Conference didn\u2019t permit the sales of beer and wine at sporting events until 2019.",
      "That policy change spurred Tennessee and other SEC programs to start getting local breweries to launch signature beers that could be sold at their games as well as in stores or tap rooms off campus. Tennessee partnered with Knoxville-based Yee-Haw Brewing Company last summer to make Vol Lager the exclusive craft beer of the Tennessee Volunteers.",
      "\u201cI think for the distributors and even the companies to get a return on their investment in terms of the sponsorship, being able to sell it within the venues is a big deal because when our fans can see it \u2014 100,000 people walking into Neyland Stadium \u2014 they might grow fan affinity to buy it at the grocery store also,\u201d said Alicia Longworth, Tennessee\u2019s deputy athletics director/chief marketing officer. \u201cWith the timing, it was good for the business and it was good for us.\u201d",
      "Longworth said Tennessee sold 16 different types of beer throughout Neyland Stadium last fall and Vol Lager always ranked in the top four.",
      "Gehl said over 3,000 \u201ccase equivalents\u201d (including cases of the canned beer or the equivalent of a case in draft beer) of Third Space Brewing were sold in the first three months since its partnership with Marquette began. Third Space is now selling sweatshirts with both the Third Space and Marquette logos as well as glasses that resemble the Marquette Golden Ale can.",
      "Other schools have enjoyed similar success with their signature beers. Learfield said college-licensed alcoholic beverages had $7.5 million in total sales during the 2024 fiscal year.",
      "Some universities with signature beers have proceeds go directly to the schools. Others have it go through collectives. For instance, Cincy Reigns \u2014 a collective benefiting Cincinnati athletics, established a partnership with Cincinnati brewery Rhinegeist to sell Cincy Light at Bearcats games and around the area.",
      "\u201cSome of the early feedback I received was there were bars and restaurants that said fans were showing up in gear just to drink Cincy Light at the bar,\u201d said Brian Fox, who chairs the Cincy Reigns board of directors. \u201cI think there was a TGI Friday's in one of the suburban areas, that said people were showing up \u2014 they weren\u2019t getting a table for dinner, they just knew they had Cincy Light on tap, so they showed up in fan gear, University of Cincinnati athletics gear just to try Cincy Light.\u201d",
      "Moss noted that these type of partnerships require plenty of input from both the school and the brewery, noting that you can\u2019t make a successful product just by slapping a school logo on a beer can.",
      "These schools generally try to find breweries with local ties. Yee-Haw, the company that partnered with Tennessee, was founded by Tennessee law school graduate Joe Baker. Third Space, which makes Marquette Golden Ale, has its brewery less than 1 \u00bd miles from Marquette\u2019s campus.",
      "But the most important factor in the success of these beers is obvious.",
      "Joe Dobrogowski of Germantown, Wisconsin, made that point clear as he enjoyed a Marquette Golden Ale before a recent game.",
      "\u201cIf it didn\u2019t taste good, I wouldn\u2019t force myself to drink,\u201d the Marquette season-ticket holder said. \u201cThat\u2019s first and foremost. I think it\u2019s just a bonus that some of it goes back to the school.\u201d",

      "Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, carried a pistol and zip ties into the intensive care unit at UPMC Memorial Hospital in southern Pennsylvania's York County and took staff members hostage Saturday before he was killed in a shootout with police, officials said. The attack also left a doctor, nurse, custodian and two other officers wounded.",
      "Officers opened fire as Archangel-Ortiz held at gunpoint a female staff member whose hands had been zip-tied, police said.",

      "\u2014 In 2022, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation. Later that year, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child\u2019s birth.",

      "MANDAN, N.D. -- A Texas pipeline company's lawsuit accusing Greenpeace of defamation, disruptions and attacks during protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline goes to trial in North Dakota on Monday, in a case the environmental advocacy organization says threatens free speech rights and its very future.",
      "The lawsuit stems from the protests in 2016 and 2017 over the oil pipeline's planned Missouri River crossing, upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe has long argued that the pipeline threatens its water supply. Of the thousands of people who protested the project, hundreds were arrested.",

      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer alleges Greenpeace tried to delay construction of the pipeline, defamed the companies behind it, and coordinated trespassing, vandalism and violence by pipeline protesters. The lawsuit seeks millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The Dakota Access Pipeline was completed and has been transporting oil since June 2017.",
      "Greenpeace International said it shouldn't be named in the lawsuit because it is distinct from the two U.S.-based Greenpeace entities, operates outside the U.S., and its employees were never in North Dakota or involved with the protests.",
      "Greenpeace USA said the plaintiffs have failed to back up their claims in the years since the protests.",
      "Earlier in February, a judge denied motions by Greenpeace to throw out or limit parts of the case.",

      "\u201cThis trial is a critical test of the future of the First Amendment, both freedom of speech and peaceful protest, under the Trump administration and beyond,\u201d Greenpeace USA Interim Executive Director Sushma Raman told reporters. \u201cA bad ruling in this case could put our rights and freedoms in jeopardy for all of us, whether we are journalists, protesters or anyone who wants to engage in public debate.\u201d",

      "Energy Transfer is arguing that \u201canyone engaged in a training at a protest should be held responsible for the actions of every person at that protest,\u201d Padmanabha said. \u201cSo it's pretty easy to see how, if successful, this kind of tactic could have a serious chilling effect on anyone who might consider participating in a protest.\u201d",
      "Earlier in February, Greenpeace International filed an anti-intimidation suit in the District Court of Amsterdam against Energy Transfer, saying the company acted wrongfully and should pay costs and damages resulting from its \u201cmeritless\" litigation.",

      "Thieves have targeted freight trains running through California and Arizona in a string of audacious heists that have resulted in the theft of more than $2 million worth of new Nike sneakers",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Thieves have targeted freight trains running through the deserts of California and Arizona in a string of audacious heists resulting in the theft of more than $2 million worth of new Nike sneakers, including many that haven't hit the retail market yet, according to officials and court documents.",
      "In a Jan. 13 robbery, suspects cut an air brake hose on a BNSF freight train traveling through a remote section of Arizona and made off with more than 1,900 pairs of unreleased Nikes worth more than $440,000, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Phoenix. Many of the shoes were Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4s, which won\u2019t be available to the public until March 14 and are expected to retail at $225 per pair, the complaint states.",
      "It was one of at least 10 heists targeting BNSF trains in remote areas of the Mojave Desert since last March that authorities are investigating, the Los Angeles Times reported. All but one resulted in the theft of Nike sneakers, according to investigators.",
      "Eleven people were charged in the Jan. 13 burglary with possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment. All 11 have pleaded not guilty and were all ordered detained until trial. Ten are Mexicans who were in the United States illegally. Another defendant is a Mexican citizen who was in asylum proceedings in the United States, authorities said in court records.",
      "The suspects in the Jan. 13 heist were caught with the help of tracking devices that were inside some of the boxes, the complaint says.",
      "In another case, a BNSF train came to an emergency stop near Hackberry, Arizona, on Nov. 20 after it started losing air, according to a complaint filed in the Phoenix federal court. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Mohave County stopped a white panel van seen leaving the area and found about 180 pairs of then-unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers valued at $41,400, the complaint states.",
      "Two other cases in which BNSF freight trains were burglarized near Kingman and Seligman, Arizona, last year resulted in the theft of $612,000 worth of Nikes and eight arrests, according to federal criminal complaints.",
      "Thieves typically scout merchandise on rail lines that parallel Interstate 40 by boarding slow-moving trains, such as when they are changing tracks and opening containers, said Keith Lewis, vice president of operations at Verisk\u2019s CargoNet and a deputy sheriff in Arizona. Lewis told the Times that the thieves are sometimes tipped off to valuable shipments by associates working at warehouses or trucking companies.",
      "In another case, authorities say a Mexican man who controlled crews that burglarized trains had scouts who would tip him off on trains to target, supplied vehicles, paid crews and facilitated the sale of stolen merchandise.",
      "The suspects are often aided by accomplices in \u201cfollow vehicles,\u201d which track the rail cars. The loot is tossed off the train after it comes to a halt \u2014 either for a scheduled stop or because an air hose has been cut, according to Brynna Cooke, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent cited in affidavits filed in federal court.",
      "Thefts from cargo trains cost the nation\u2019s six largest freight railroads more than $100 million last year because of a combination of the value of the stolen goods and the cost of repairs to railcars the thieves damaged, and the problem is getting worse in recent years as the thefts have become more organized and sophisticated. The Association of American Railroads trade group estimates that the number of thefts jumped roughly 40% last year to 65,000 nationwide.",
      "In 2022, thieves raided cargo containers aboard trains nearing downtown Los Angeles for months, taking packages belonging to people across the U.S. and leaving the tracks blanketed with discarded boxes of items deemed not valuable enough to steal. The audacious thefts prompted authorities and freight companies to step up security in the area. In 2015, thieves stole 111 guns after busting the locks off a train in a Chicago railyard.",
      "Railroads have invested millions in measures to help prevent such thefts, but it\u2019s not like they can easily restrict access to the more than 140,000 miles of track they operate across the country. It crosses remote, rural areas and cuts through the heart of many cities carrying millions of shipments of everything from bulk commodities like coal and grain to raw materials like rock.",
      "The rail trade group said additional federal enforcement and tougher penalties are needed to deter the thefts. The railroads estimate that only about 1 out of every 10 theft attempts result in an arrest, and many of the people who are arrested are repeat offenders. One railroad even reported arresting the same individual five times in a single day.",
      "BNSF and the other major freight railroad that hauls goods across the western United States, Union Pacific, didn\u2019t immediately respond to inquiries from The Associated Press about the thefts. BNSF said in a statement to the Times that its internal police force shares information with local law enforcement and prosecutors as appropriate.",
      "The company said its crews are instructed not to confront thieves, but to report the incidents instead. But the crews rarely encounter them, it said, because the trains are so long and the thieves take care to evade detection.",
      "Cargo thefts from trains, trucks and ships are a problem in shipping hubs all across the country and a focus of the FBI. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that cargo thefts at various points along the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for between $15 billion and $35 billion in losses every year. Many of the more organized groups target major shipping hubs like Los Angeles, Dallas, Memphis, Chicago and Atlanta."

      "\u201cCompanies report widespread concerns about the impact of federal government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \u201cSales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.\u201d",
      "\"We have factored rising U.S. tariffs and related countermeasures into our forecasts since December 2024, with trade weakness the primary cause of the projected slowdown in quarter- over-quarter global real GDP growth rates this year. Weaker investment is a key downside risk,\u201d Ken Wattret, a global economist at S&P Global, said in a report.",
      "A separate report said U.S. consumers are bracing for higher inflation, in part because of potential tariffs that could raise prices for all kinds of imports. They\u2019re broadly expecting prices to be 4.3% higher 12 months from now, which is a big jump from their forecast of 3.3% inflation last month, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. That fits with preliminary data in the survey earlier this month.",
      "A third report said sales of previously occupied homes were weaker last month than economists expected. Relatively high mortgage rates, along with expensive prices for homes, have been hurting sales.",
      "Stocks of the smallest companies, whose profits can be more closely tied to the strength of the U.S. economy than big multinational rivals, fell more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks dropped a market-leading",
      "Akamai Technologies had the sharpest drop in the S&P 500, even though the cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It lost a fifth of its value and fell 21.7% as investors focused instead on its forecasts for revenue and other financial measures this upcoming year, which fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations.",
      "Before Friday\u2019s sharp drop, the S&P 500 had been heading for a week of almost zero movement. Helping to lift stocks had been a steady parade of better-than-expected profit reports. That helped offset worries about stubbornly high inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates.",
      "The Fed has been holding its main interest rate steady after sharply cutting it through the end of last year. At their last policy meeting in January, Fed officials suggested they may stay on hold for a while given worries about how Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, along with other factors, could push upward on inflation.",
      "While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also encourage spending that puts upward pressure on inflation.",
      "In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 11 cents to $70.29 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 7 cents to $73.98 per barrel.",

      "Europe\u2019s Just Eat Takeaway",
      "NEW YORK -- Europe's Just Eat Takeaway.com could soon have a new owner. Technology investment company Prosus has agreed to buy the food delivery giant for 4.1 billion euros ($4.29 billion).",
      "The companies announced the all-cash offer, which values Just Eat Takeaway.com at 20.30 euros ($21.24) per share, on Monday. Prosus says the deal would create the fourth-largest food delivery group worldwide.",
      "Acquiring Just Eat Takeaway.com will particularly boost Prosus' food delivery portfolio in Europe. The tech investor, which is based in Amsterdam and majority-owned by South Africa\u2019s Naspers, has already tapped into this business both in and outside of the continent \u2014 including through its full ownership of Brazil-based platform iFood and a 28% stake in Germany's Delivery Hero.",
      "Still, CEO Fabricio Bloisi said the Just Eat Takeaway.com deal brings \"the opportunity to create a European tech champion.\u201d",
      "Just Eat Takeaway.com, also based in Amsterdam, currently operates in 17 countries \u2014 but has recently doubled down on its markets in Europe. And recently, the company exited its U.S. operations by selling Grubhub to New York-based Wonder Group. The $650 million a transaction, which closed last month, represented a fraction of the $7.3 billion Just Eat agreed to buy Grubhub for back in 2021.",
      "\u201cJust Eat Takeaway.com is now a faster growing, more profitable and predominantly European-based business,\" Just Eat Takeaway.com CEO Jitse Groen said in a statement Monday \u2014 adding that Prosus' offer \u201cfully supports\u201d the company's strategic plans going forward. \"We are looking forward to an exciting future together.\u201d",
      "Takeaway.com, which merged with Just Eat in 2020, was founded back in 2000 \u2014 making it one of the earliest entries in the food delivery sector. But competition rapidly increased as now-popular platforms, such as Uber Eats and DoorDash in the U.S., also joined the game. And customers jumping between apps can make it difficult to keep sales stable.",
      "The Prosus transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. But the offer is expected to be settled by the end of the year.",
      "Shares of Just Eat were up over 54% on Monday. Meanwhile, Prosus' stock sank 7.29%."

    "story": [
      "Ludvig Aberg and Brian Campbell don't have much in common except winning on the PGA Tour",
      "One week the PGA Tour winner was Ludvig Aberg, a Swede so supremely talented that he played in a Ryder Cup before his first major, entered the top 10 in the world ranking just nine months after he left college and has been there ever since.",
      "The next week it was Brian Campbell, a 31-year-old who averaged $7,999 for the 186 tournaments he played over the last decade \u2014 one full year on the PGA Tour, the rest on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2014 before winning the Mexico Open. That was worth $1,260,000.",
      "Golf needs them both.",
      "Stars are what fuel interest. The PGA Tour gets a boost from these 72-man signature events with $20 million purses because they tend to deliver big names and often big moments. Scottie Scheffler has won four of them over the last two years. Rory McIlroy has won twice.",
      "There also has been some discussion over the last 25 years \u2014 dating to the World Golf Championships \u2014 that smaller fields make it easier to win no matter how stacked they are. But the signature events have not disappointed.",
      "Campbell, however, was a reminder that anyone can win on any given week. He had never won, not in his short time on the PGA Tour or what seemed like an eternity on the Korn Ferry Tour. That's one of the great charms about golf and always will be.",
      "His victory also showed those longshot moments still exist, even as the PGA Tour moves to reduce the number of full cards from 125 to 100 this year, and starts reducing the size of fields next year, including the elimination of some Monday qualifiers.",
      "Yes, the numbers are shrinking, but the opportunity is there.",
      "Meritocracy has not left the building.",
      "Campbell had a career season on the Korn Ferry Tour last year with three runner-up finishes to finish No. 8 on the points list and earn a ticket back to the big leagues. That gave him access to tournaments like the Mexico Open, where the final hour was no less compelling than when Aberg tracked down Maverick McNealy at Torrey Pines.",
      "An otherwise sleepy week at the Mexico Open \u2014 only two players from the top 30, four from the top 50 in the world \u2014 produced a duel over the final hour that was fun to watch considering what was at stake.",
      "There was Aldrich Potgieter, full of promise and power, a 20-year-old South African who won the British Amateur at the age of 17 and last year became the youngest Korn Ferry Tour winner. He's only getting started, and he simply smashes it off the tee.",
      "Potgieter led the field at Vidanta Vallarta by averaging 324.7 yards for all his measured drives, nine of them at 350 yards or longer.",
      "Campbell couldn't keep up with that \u2014 he was on average 39 yards shorter off the tee \u2014 and he didn't try. He spent the weekend alongside Potgieter and never flinched. He played with what he had, and it was enough.",
      "Both felt the nerves of trying to win their first PGA Tour title.",
      "\u201cI thought I was going to throw up at multiple times during the day,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "\u201cPressure is a big thing. You can't really beat it, you just have to learn and adjust to it next time you're in this position,\u201d Potgieter said.",
      "The playoff was as fickle as golf gets. Potgieter twice pounded drives into the fairway on the par-5 18th holes, leaving him only a 6-iron to the green. Both times he could only manage par.",
      "Campbell pushed his drive so badly on the second playoff hole that it was sailing out-of-bounds until it crashed into the trees and caromed back into play. He was on hardpan, 94 yards behind Potgieter. He ripped a 3-wood back into position and hit lob wedge 3 1/2 feet from the hole.",
      "Potgieter missed his birdie putt from 6 feet. Campbell made his for the win, and the shock of it all didn't wear off for some time, especially after his girlfriend, Kelsi, just about tackled him on the 18th green and he swung her around in pure joy.",
      "\u201cI'm literally freaking out on the inside,\u201d Campbell told NBC when he regained his footing. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Here's what is going on. Campbell is headed to The Players Championship to compete for a $25 million purse. Then he has the Masters, and the PGA Championship. Along the way, he'll be in five of the $20 million signature events left on the PGA Tour schedule.",
      "Everyone expects Aberg or McIlroy or Scheffler or a dozen other stars to win. Not many knew anything about Campbell, who became a PGA Tour footnote as the last person assessed a penalty for slow play for two bad times in 2017 in New Orleans.",
      "(That was a weird one, the first year the Zurich Classic went to two-man teams. Campbell and teammate Miguel Angel Carballo each got a bad time, and because it was foursomes, they counted as one competitor).",
      "Now he's a PGA Tour winner, a feel-good story, just like Rafael Campos last year when he arrived in Bermuda two hours before his tee time because his wife had just given birth to their first child. In danger of losing his card, he won for the first time.",
      "They don't move the needle. That doesn't mean there's no room for them in this sport.",
      "The PGA Tour hopes to be stronger by rewarding the top performers and by reducing jobs and field sizes. That's harsh for those who don't make it, but they have no excuses as long as they have a tee time \u2014 whether that's in signature events, regular events or opposite-field events, or even if they have to go back to the Korn Ferry Tour or Q-school.",
      "No one ever wants to hear the solution is to play better, either because they have heard it for too long or they know it's true.",
      "A leaner tour \u2014 fewer cards, smaller fields \u2014 eliminates those who don't perform. That was Campbell in 2017 and for the next seven years in the minor leagues.",
      "And now he's going to the Masters.",

      "The 76ers are a team in trouble",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Yes, the Philadelphia 76ers played without two-time NBA scoring champion and the always-injured Joel Embiid. Yes, they haven't been a playoff contender this season, even with two other All-Stars in the starting lineup.",
      "Yet, there it was, on the scoreboard, on all the social media derision, on the top of the implausibility-meter when the 76ers broke camp for the Bahamas.",
      "That was no misprint on the ticker in the fourth quarter: Bulls 136, 76ers 86.",
      "Down 50!",
      "Did the Sixers quit? Do the Sixers realize \u2014 with or without whatever Embiid and his balky left knee can give them \u2014 their season is over?",
      "\u201cI don't want to believe that,\u201d nine-time All-Star Paul George said. \u201cI don't sense that in the locker room and I don't believe that.\u201d",
      "George has little choice publicly but to stand by the Sixers, even as they lost their eighth straight game and 10th of 11 overall \u2014 142-110 on Monday nigh t to the 23-win Chicago Bulls \u2014 and see even the odds of a play-in tournament berth dip to the point where fans are already looking at next season.",
      "Not that it promises anything better than the mess that's unraveled in South Philly this year.",
      "\u201cI'm not quite sure what fell apart to give up 140 points, at home, against the Chicago Bulls,\u201d George said.",
      "The real bad news \u2014 you know, before six Bulls scored at least 15 points \u2014 came hours ahead of this debacle when the Sixers offered no real update on Embiid. Embiid missed his 38th game of the season for the sagging Sixers, and all options \u2014 from rest to potential surgery to playing through pain \u2014 remain on the table, depending on the results of continued testing and imaging.",
      "Embiid has played in just 19 of 57 games for the Sixers, who fell to 20-37 an have only a faint shot at earning a berth in the NBA play-in tournament. Embiid has averaged 23.8 points \u2014 he averaged at least 30 and won two scoring titles the last three seasons \u2014 and scored only 29 points combined in his last two games.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody envisioned it going like this,\u201d coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing on a lot of levels. He wants to play. We want him to play. Our best version is of with him playing. It hasn\u2019t worked out like that. Yet.\u201d",
      "The 76ers are a franchise in turmoil and suffering through an internal tug-of-war when it comes to Embiid. Can he play through the pain and should he, even with the woeful record? Why not just shut him down and try again next year?",
      "Even George \u2014 who left the Los Angeles Clippers to sign a four-year, $212 million free-agent contract \u2014 conceded the juice might not be worth the squeeze when it comes to a potential Embiid return. The 76ers are one of the worst teams in the league and are trending closer to Toronto, Charlotte, Washington and a lottery pick than making a serious run in the postseason.",
      "Maybe sitting Embiid is for the best \u2014 just as it was seemingly was early in the Process.",
      "The 76ers\u2019 first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, perhaps one more reason the Sixers could shut down Embiid and cut their losses on the season.",
      "\u201cWe're showing no signs of a team that will compete,\u201d George said. \u201cWe just don't have the habits of a championship or a playoff-contending team would have. To be honest, right now, it's a little farfetched. All we can do is work hard. Try to just keep going for one another. We've shown no signs of, forget championship, but a playoff contending-team here.\u201d",
      "Does Nurse survive and earn a third season on the bench?",
      "What about team president Daryl Morey, who built this mishmashed roster full of patchwork free-agents and needlessly gave Embiid a three-year, $193 million contract extension ahead of training camp.",
      "Just as former Eagles running back Ricky Watters once said: For who? For what?",
      "\u201cWe've got to be more dialed in. More effort. More energy,\" George said. \"More pride on the defensive end. Again, same conversations we've been having. Low communication. It baffles me just how easy we give up layups in this league. I don't understand.\u201d",
      "Join the club.",
      "So where is the next win on the schedule? Wednesday night against a Knicks team winning at a 65% clip at Madison Square Garden? Against Steph Curry and the Warriors?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a vision, but we have a lot of games left,\u201d 2024 All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said.",
      "Not really. Certainly not enough to make anyone who watched a 1-9 February \u2014 and has four of 20 wins against Charlotte \u2014 believe the season can be saved. The 76ers are only 7-8 this season when Embiid, George and Maxey start together.",
      "\u201cEverybody needs to look at themselves, at what they can do better, and then look at what they can do better for the team. And do our jobs, man. Be professional,\u201d Nurse said.",

    "summary": "The NBA is on the cusp of accomplishing something that it hasn&rsquo;t seen before",

      "The NBA is on the cusp of accomplishing something that it hasn\u2019t seen before",
      "The NBA is on the cusp of accomplishing something that it hasn't seen before. The jury's still out on whether it's a good thing.",
      "With about seven weeks left in the season, 2-point shots are accounting for 49% of scoring. And if that stat holds up \u2014 there's no indication that it won't \u2014 this will be the first season in which 2-pointers make up less than half of the league's point production.",
      "The current breakdown: a record-low 49% of scoring comes from 2-pointers, a record-high 36% comes from 3-pointers, and a near-record-low 15% comes from the foul line. Those numbers are just more proof of how the 3-point shot continues permeating the game, and that's why plenty of people are wondering aloud if the league has a real problem on its hands.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with guys and teams shooting a lot of 3s,\u201d said Golden State's Stephen Curry, the league's all-time leader in 3-pointers and someone closing in on 4,000 such makes for his regular-season career. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s the way that I play, and I love that factor in the game. But you\u2019ve also got to put the work in behind the scenes to take full advantage of it.\u201d",
      "This isn't a new phenomenon.",
      "Barring some sort of major shift in how the game is played over the next seven weeks, the league is on pace to break the record for 3-pointers in a season (it\u2019ll be the 15th consecutive season in which the 3s-per-game record falls) and 3-pointers attempted in a season (a new mark will be set there for the 19th time in the last 22 seasons).",
      "Boston is leading the 3-point assault this year, though the Celtics are hardly the only 3-happy team. But the defending NBA champions are clearly more reliant on the shot than anyone else, with 46% of their points this season coming from beyond the arc. They'll almost certainly become only the third team in NBA history to finish a season with more points from 3s than 2s, joining the 2018-19 Houston Rockets and 2020-21 Utah Jazz.",
      "\u201cEverybody can\u2019t play the same way,\" Celtics All-Star forward and two-time Olympic gold medalist Jayson Tatum said. \"You've got to have the right personnel. But, you know, the way we play works for us. So, we play to our strengths.\u201d",
      "The Celtics are the only franchise in NBA history to have eight different players make 100 3s in a season; they've done it in each of the last two seasons and are on pace to do it again this year. For them, the 3-pointer is the golden ticket; they're 33-6 this season when they make at least 17 3s, and just 8-10 when they don't make that many.",
      "They had five 3-point shooters on the floor together last season and the result was an NBA championship. It was, at times, impossible to guard. Golden State rode the brilliance of Curry and Klay Thompson to four NBA titles in their years as the Warriors' \u201cSplash Brothers,\" a duo that helped usher in a new era of 3-point reliance. And the math is simple: shooting 40% on 3s gets you more points per attempt than shooting 50% on 2s does.",
      "\u201cRight now, I think the defense has to catch up and maybe NBA teams will shoot less 3s,\u201d San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama said at the All-Star break, before he was shut down for the year with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. \u201cBut analytics back it up, so it makes sense.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama was averaging 8.8 3-point tries per game this season, the most of any center in the league, and his 403 attempts on the season from beyond the arc is still more entering this week than some of the game's best shooters \u2014 a list of players that includes Phoenix's Devin Booker, the Los Angeles Lakers' Austin Reaves and Miami's Duncan Robinson.",
      "But the numbers say it's a good shot. So, Wembanyama took them. A lot of them. The Spurs, for years, were a team that didn't prioritize the 3-pointer. And now, it's a weapon for them and everyone else in the league.",
      "\u201cThe game has evolved,\u201d said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, an elite shooter in his playing days.",
      "It keeps evolving. Commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this month that he listened to an off-the-record conversation between Kerr and broadcaster Bob Costas at the tech summit during All-Star weekend, the keynote address of sorts for those who were invited to that event. Silver later shared that Kerr conceded there may be a bit too much 3-point shooting in today's NBA, but that he liked the current state of the game and wouldn't recommend any changes.",
      "Silver thinks it's all cyclical. He said when the All-Star weekend last came to the Bay Area in 2000, \u201cmany people were saying it was too physical, we were too dependent on the dunk, that players weren\u2019t sufficiently skilled as they were than in the old days.\u201d",
      "It's all very different now.",
      "\u201cThe fact now that you can\u2019t play in this league unless you can shoot, that even 7-footers have to be able to shoot these days and have to be able to shoot at long range, I actually think that\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d Silver said.",

      "At one point, the odds of a strike in 2032 were as high as about 3% and topped the world\u2019s asteroid-risk lists.",
      "ESA has since lowered the odds to 0.001%. NASA had it down to 0.0027% \u2014 meaning the asteroid will safely pass Earth in 2032 and there's no threat of impact for the next century.",
      "But there\u2019s still a 1.7% chance that asteroid could hit the moon on Dec. 22, 2032, according to NASA. The world's telescopes will continue to track the asteroid as it heads away from us, with the Webb Space Telescope zooming in next month to pinpoint its size. It's expected to vanish from view in another month or two.",
      "Discovered in December, the asteroid is an estimated 130 feet to 300 feet (40 meters to 90 meters) across, and swings our way every four years.",
      "\u201cWhile this asteroid no longer poses a significant impact hazard to Earth, 2024 YR4 provided an invaluable opportunity\" for study, NASA said in a statement.",

      "AYIA NAPA, Cyprus -- A first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea, officials said Monday.",
      "The small, autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, hailed as the \u201cfuture of underwater surveillance\u201d will be equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to give scientists at the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute a clear picture on the effectiveness of their intricate artificial reefs designed and built using 3D printing.",
      "Made of an environmentally friendly cement mixture, the artificial reefs will be embedded with a docking station at which the AUVs can recharge and transmit collected data including video, said CMMI CEO Zakarias Siokouros.",
      "The advantage of the AUVs lies in their ability to loiter underwater for as long as a month at a time and provide a continuous flow of data while \u201cprotecting\u201d the reefs by alerting scientists to any disturbance in protected waters from illegal fishing and encroaching boats. Scientists would, in turn, notify local authorities.",
      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

      "A bill to ban the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- The prospect of banning the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king, but some of the proposal's staunchest opposition has come from ranchers and farming groups who say they can compete without the government\u2019s help.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 one of the largest pork producers in the country \u2014 is behind the push to ban cultivated meat, saying he wants to protect ranchers and meat producers. The Republican governor signed an executive order last August to keep state agencies and contractors from procuring lab-created meat, even though it could be years before such products are on store shelves.",
      "A number of ranchers and meat industry groups are pushing back on the governor's plan.",
      "Dan Morgan is a fourth-generation cattle rancher from central Nebraska who supplies high-end beef to all 50 states and six countries. He welcomes companies seeking to produce lab-grown meat to \u201cjump into the pool\u201d and try to compete with his Waygu beef. Stifling competition in a free market should be anathema in a Republican-dominated state like Nebraska, he said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,\u201d he said, adding that the government should be limited to regulating the new product's labels and inspecting its facilities to ensure food safety.",
      "\u201cAfter that, it's up to the consumer to make the decision about what they buy and eat.\u201d",
      "Nebraska is among about a dozen states that have introduced measures to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of lab-grown products, according to . Two states \u2014 Florida and Alabama \u2014 have already enacted such bans.",
      "The target of the bills is \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d or \u201ccell-cultured\u201d meat, which is grown from the cells of animals in bioreactor steel tanks. The cells are bathed for weeks in nutrients, prompting them to grow and divide, turning them into skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissues.",
      "The push to ban cultivated meat comes well before the innovation could be considered an industry. While more than two dozen companies are working to develop such meat products, only two \u2014 Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California \u2014 have been approved by the federal government to sell cultivated chicken in the U.S. Even then, none of the companies are close to mass producing and selling the products on store shelves.",
      "In recent weeks, supporters of the Nebraska bill have shifted their arguments from industry protection to questions of safety surrounding cell-cultured meat. That includes its sponsor, state Sen. Barry DeKay, a Nebraska rancher, and Sherry Vinton, the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Both testified in support of the bill at a committee hearing earlier this week, calling cultured meat \u201csynthetic food\u201d and voicing concern about possible health implications from eating it.",
      "But it's been no secret that the push for a ban is rooted in shielding Nebraska's traditional meat industry. Nebraska tops all other states for beef production and beef exports, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.",
      "Pillen named the ban among his top priorities during his State of the State address last month.",
      "\u201cThe backers of these products are cut from the same cloth as the anti-farmer activists who want to put our agriculture producers out of business, and we need to recognize them as such,\u201d he said.",
      "The Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation, the lobbying group for the emerging cultured meat industry, disputes Pillen's insistence that it's a threat to the traditional meat industry, noting studies that show global demand for meat-based protein will double by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really a complementary component here,\u201d said Suzi Gerber, executive director of the association. \u201cSo it\u2019s a little bit mystifying to me why any individual stakeholder would see this as a threat.\u201d",
      "Several farm organizations, including Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Cattlemen and the Nebraska Pork Producers, agree they're not worried about competition from the emerging industry. Those groups prefer a sister bill that would only require they be clearly labeled as lab-grown products to separate them from traditional meat. More than a dozen states have also issued similar labeling bills, and some \u2014 like Colorado \u2014 have seen ban efforts abandoned in favor of labeling measures.",
      "Paul Sherman is an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Upside Foods in its lawsuit challenging the Florida ban. He said it's no surprise most of the proposed bans are being pushed by those with connections to traditional agriculture.",
      "\u201cI think it certainly shows that the purpose of these laws isn\u2019t about protecting public health and safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting traditional agriculture from economic competition. And that is not a legitimate use of government power.\u201d"

      "A new and massive study finds that climate change is melting the world\u2019s mountain glaciers faster than ever",
      "Climate change is accelerating the melting of the world's mountain glaciers, according to a massive new study that found them shrinking more than twice as fast as in the early 2000s.",
      "The world's glaciers lost ice at the rate of about 255 billion tons (231 billion metric tons) annual from 2000 to 2011, but that quickened to about 346 billion tons (314 billion metric tons) annually over about the next decade, according to the study in this week\u2019s journal Nature.",
      "And the last few years, the melt has accelerated even more, hitting a record 604 billion tons (548 billion metric tons) lost in 2023, the last year analyzed.",
      "The study drew on an international effort that included 233 estimates of changes in glacier weight. In all, the world's glaciers have lost more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) since 2000, according to the study.",
      "\u201cThe thing that people should be aware of and perhaps worried about is that yes, the glaciers are indeed retreating and disappearing as we said they would. The rate of that loss seems to be accelerating,\u201d said William Colgan, a glaciologist for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and one of about 60 authors of the study.",
      "Glaciers in Alaska are melting at the fastest rate of any of the 19 regions studied, losing about 67 billion tons (61 billion metric tons) of ice a year, producing the biggest net ice loss, the study found.",
      "In the past 24 years, Central Europe\u2019s glaciers have lost the highest percentage of ice of any region, now 39% smaller than they were in 2000, the paper said. Colgan said he worries most about the Alps because \u201celevated summer temperatures have been hammering the Alps. \u201d",
      "Fifteen years ago, scientists were worried most about the Andes and the Patagonia glaciers, but the Alps have shrunk so fast they could eventually disappear, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are apolitical and unbiased sentinels of climate change, and their decline paints a clear picture of accelerated warming,\u201d said Gwenn Flowers, a professor of Earth Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who also wasn't part of the study, said glaciers shrank and grew in the past for local, well-understood reasons that were not climate change. What's happening now is different and clear, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s due to greenhouse gas increases caused directly by coal, oil, and natural gas burning. ... No amount of rhetoric, tweeting, or proclamation will change that.\u201d",
      "Scambos, Flowers and other outside scientists called the assessment sobering and accurate but not surprising.",
      "Colgan said that many places \u2014 such as those in the U.S. West \u2014 are seeing extra water now from fast-melting glaciers and benefiting from that boost, but that will soon disappear as the glaciers melt beyond a point of no return.",
      "Melting glaciers contribute more to sea level rise than ice loss in either Greenland or Antarctica. Only the expansion of water as it warms plays a bigger role in sea level rise, the paper said.",
      "The overall glacier loss rate is similar, if maybe slightly less, than that found by earlier and less comprehensive studies. But this new work will probably trigger new predictions that will be even gloomier in the future because of better information and worsening warming, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re losing 5.5% of the global ice volume in just over 20 years, clearly that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cThat's going to catch up with you.\u201d",
      "The more than 600 billion tons of glacier loss in 2023 \u201csounds incredible now, but it might sound pretty normal in 10 years from now,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cMountain glaciers as a whole can flip into collective ice loss pretty darn quick.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is investigating delays and cost overruns in California\u2019s high-speed rail project",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Trump administration is once again targeting California's controversial high-speed rail project, with federal transportation officials on Thursday announcing an investigation and possible withdrawal of about $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 for a project designed to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. It was slated to cost $33 billion and be finished by 2020. But the project has been beset by funding challenges, cost overruns and delays.",
      "Now, state officials are focused on a 171-mile (275-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced, which is set to be operating by 2033. The entire San Francisco to Los Angeles line will now cost an estimated $106 billion to finish and officials hope to complete it in the next 20 years if there is money.",
      "\u201cI am directing my staff to review and determine whether the (California High-Speed Rail Authority) has followed through on the commitments it made to receive billions of dollars in federal funding. If not, I will have to consider whether that money could be given to deserving infrastructure projects elsewhere in the United States,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference in Los Angeles.",
      "President Donald Trump canceled nearly $1 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail project in 2019, during his first term. The Biden administration later restored the funding and, in December 2023, allocated $3.3 billion more.",
      "Losing that money would be a major blow to the project. The rail authority's most recent business plan counts on receiving up to $8 billion in federal money to help close a funding gap.",
      "Ian Choudri, CEO of the California\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority, which oversees planning and funding for the project, said he welcomes the investigation.",
      "\u201cWith multiple independent federal and state audits completed, every dollar is accounted for, and we stand by the progress and impact of this project,\u201d Choudri said.",
      "He said the project has created nearly 15,000 jobs and that more than 50 major structures have been completed so far.",
      "Several Republican Congress members have taken aim at the project over its costs. On Thursday, Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents 3rd Congressional District that stretches alongside much of the state\u2019s border with Nevada and includes Sacramento\u2019s northeastern suburbs, called the California high-speed rail \u201cthe worst public infrastructure failure in U.S. history.\u201d",
      "\"There is no plausible scenario where the cost to federal or state taxpayers can be justified. It is past time to stop throwing good money after bad, and we must formally end this project,\u201d said Kiley, who introduced a bill earlier this year to make the project ineligible for further federal funding.",
      "Kiley joined Duffy in Los Angeles' Union Station for the announcement of the probe. Those present were interrupted at times by booing by about 30 demonstrators. The protesters also chanted \u201cbuild the rail!\u201d and held up signs that read \u201cCA has no king\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t delay our train.\u201d",
      "Eli Lipmen, executive director of Move LA, an organization that advocates for efficient public transit systems, said the high-speed train project remains popular among many Californians.",
      "\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to start an investigation, but come on, this is a sham investigation,\u201d Lipmen, who was at Union Station during the announcement, told KABC-TV.",
      "Greg Regan and Shari Semelsberger, president and secretary-treasurer of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all the country's rail unions, said the project is the most ambitious and innovative transportation project in the country and urged Trump to become \u201ca Builder-in-Chief by bringing high-speed rail to America.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuilding ambitious projects requires bold leadership and a commitment to getting the job done. Just last year, President Trump complained that the United States does not have bullet trains similar to Japan. We agree with him that it is past time for our country to have these kinds of modern, efficient, high-capacity transportation systems,\" they said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The House passed the GOP budget plan for Trump's agenda Tuesday night after briefly pulling it from the schedule.",
    "story": [
      "Speaker Mike Johnson faced a major test to rally enough Republican votes.",
      "Following chaos and delay, the House on Tuesday passed the Republican budget resolution to start the process to enact President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda by a vote of 217-215 -- a big and critical win for Speaker Mike Johnson, who was dealing with an extremely narrow GOP majority.",
      "GOP leaders were able to successfully flip Reps. Tim Burchett, Warren Davidson and Victoria Spartz, three of four holdouts. The other, Rep. Thomas Massie, was the only Republican who voted against the resolution. Republicans could afford to lose only one vote.",
      "\"A lot of work yet to be done, but we're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back at it in the morning,\" Johnson said to reporters after the vote.",
      "It was not clear whether Republicans would have the votes to pass the measure on Tuesday afternoon and into the evening. At least four Republicans members had said they would vote no on the plan and Speaker Mike Johnson could afford only one defection.",
      "House Republicans held open their first vote Tuesday night for more than an hour as leadership tried to wrangle votes for the funding resolution and Democrats protested.",
      "GOP leaders then briefly pulled the budget resolution -- the next vote in a series -- from the schedule and rescheduled it a few minutes later and called the entire House back to the chamber.",
      "Democratic leaders were able to get more of their members to attend the critical vote. Rep. Brittany Petterson, who is on maternity leave, showed up to vote with her son. Rep. Kevin Mullin, who has a medical condition, showed up with a walker. House Democratic leaders complained in a message to Democrats that Johnson was trying to \u201cjam\u201d the budget resolution through after assuring them there would be no further votes in the House for the night.",
      "Before the vote, Johnson told reporters, \"We are trying to work through concerns and issues. A lot of people want to make sure we are cutting an appropriate amount \u2026 it's a very complicated negotiation \u2026 we will get there.\"",
      "The resolution now heads to the Senate, where it is an open question as to what leadership will do with the blueprint. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has a different approach in the upper chamber -- focusing one bill on defense and border security spending and a later one that would deal with tax cuts and the debt ceiling, although the president has wholly endorsed the House Republican blueprint.",
      "Republicans plan to use reconciliation, a tactic that requires only a simple majority to pass. But under reconciliation, both chambers must adopt the exact same resolution.",
      "\"This is the first important step in opening up the reconciliation process. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us,\" Johnson said after the vote. \"We are going to deliver the America First agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step of that process.\"",
      "Republicans leaned on Trump to pressure the holdouts and other GOP members who were undecided.",
      "\"The president has talked to a number of members. He's made his intentions well known and he wants them to vote for this and move it along so we can start the process,\" Johnson said.",
      "But later Tuesday, while signing executive orders in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm not involved in that. They know what I want.\"",
      "Burchett told ABC News that he spoke to Trump, but declined to divulge details on the conversation.",
      "Johnson earlier was uncertain if the vote would happen Tuesday, suggesting it could get pushed.",
      "\"There may be a vote tonight. There may not be. Stay tuned. That's why you get paid. Hang around here,\" he said to reporters.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise defended the budget -- contending that Democrats were \"lying\" when they asserted that Republicans are primed to make deep cuts to Medicaid.",
      "\"This bill doesn't even mention the word 'Medicaid' a single time, and yet, all Democrats are doing is lying about what's in the budget because they don't want to talk about the truth,\" Scalise said. \"Instead of just sitting back and licking their wounds that they're completely out of touch with the American people, their only choice is to resort to lying about what's in this vote today. There is no Medicaid in this bill. There are no Medicaid cuts in this bill. Yet that's all they're saying.\"",
      "While the blueprint itself does not mention Medicaid directly, it sets a goal of at least $2 trillion in cuts to mandatory federal spending, which includes funding for entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Johnson and his leadership team worked for weeks to mollify concerns.",
      "Following a closed-door conference meeting Tuesday, Massie quipped that GOP leaders have \"convinced him\" to vote no -- predicting the measure would actually increase the deficit by billions of dollars.",
      "Nevertheless, Johnson defended the blueprint.",
      "\"The objective and our commitment has always been deficit neutrality. That's the goal here. If we can reduce the deficit, even better,\" Johnson said responding to accusations that the plan would increase the deficit.",
      "Some additional Republicans were undecided, including New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, stressing she was acting on behalf of her aging constituency.",
      "\"I'm still undecided, but I'm leaning more towards yes because I've gotten some clarity and assurances that make me feel comfortable allowing this process to move forward,\" she said. \"We have to make sure that leadership includes those of us who have large Medicaid populations in that process.\"",
      "Self-proclaimed \"budget hawk\" Georgia Rep. Rich McCormick said earlier he was still \"in discussions\" on whether or not to back the resolution.",
      "\"I'd like us to be more aggressive on spending cuts so we can save on things like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "\"I am trying to figure out exactly what this entails\u2026 how this bill is going to affect the actual hard numbers, and that's what I'm interested in,\" he said.",
      "House Democrats gathered on the Capitol steps Tuesday afternoon to protest an \"assault\" on democracy and the \"reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries led the group of lawmakers, declaring that Democrats have unified their opposition against the measure.",
      "\"So let me be clear, House Democrats will not provide a single vote to this reckless Republican budget, not one, not one, not one. They will not get a single Democratic vote. Why? Because we're voting with the American people,\" he said.",
      "Jeffries said the GOP budget plan \"represents the largest Medicaid cut in American history,\" adding that \"children will be devastated. Families will be devastated. People with disabilities will be devastated. Seniors will be devastated. Hospitals will be devastated; nursing homes will be devastated.\"",
      "\"Everything we care about is under assault. The economy is under assault. The safety net is under assault. Our very way of life as a country is under assault.

      "Some parts of the U.S. could see an increase in pest problems, a group says.",
      "Deviations from normal weather patterns are putting several regions in the U.S. at risk for an uptick of disease-spreading pests as winter turns to spring, according to a new analysis.",
      "A surge in disease-spreading pests like ticks, mosquitoes, cockroaches and rodents is expected in regions that experienced especially warm or wet winters this season, according to the National Pest Management Association's bi-annual Public Health Pest Index.",
      "These pests can spread dangerous diseases such as Lyme disease, West Nile virus, Salmonella, plague, and hantavirus, said Jorge Parada, medical adviser for NPMA with a focus on infectious disease, in a statement. These types of pests can also trigger asthma and allergies, Parada said.",
      "Warm winters typically allows more rats to survive, while unusual weather patterns -- such as snow in New Orleans -- can present a host of new pest problems, Jim Fredericks, senior vice president of public affairs for NPMA, told ABC News.",
      "Ticks and mosquitoes survive better when it is moist, so regions that experienced especially wet winters will likely see those pests on the rise during the spring, Fredericks said.",
      "\"If the temperatures are above 50 degrees Fahrenheit, ticks will be active and in search of food,\" Fredericks said.",
      "Changes in climate -- both in terms of warmer temperatures as well as the extreme weather events occurring as global temperatures rise -- will have a greater impact on the threats these pests pose in the future, Fredericks said. The range for pests like ticks are also spreading due to warmer temperatures, Fredericks said.",
      "The top U.S. cities named on the pest index include:",
      "Boston: \"Brutal\" snowstorms and cold snaps pushed rodents indoors in search of warmth and food sources, according to the NPMA. In addition, a forecasted warmer start to spring could give ticks a jumpstart to the season.",
      "Cleveland: \"Mild, soggy conditions\" during the winter could allow for pest populations like cockroaches and ticks to flourish as temperatures rise, the analysis found.",
      "\"The pathogens that they carry that could cause food-borne illness,\" Fredericks said, adding that rodent dander and urine can also exacerbate asthma symptoms.",
      "Denver: \"A frigid and snow-packed\" start to the season will likely drive house mice into homes and businesses, while white-footed mice activity inside structures could increase in rural areas, according to the NPMA.",
      "\"The white-footed mouse is actually one of the vectors for hantavirus,\" Fredericks said.",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan: \"Record-breaking\" snowfall is expected to drive rats and mice indoors, and heavy rain forecasted for the area could lead to a rise in tick populations as temperatures rise, according to the NPMA.",
      "Louisville, Kentucky: Rats and mice are expected to enter structures due to extreme cold and historic snowfall. Tick activity may also begin earlier than usual due to a warm spring.",
      "New Orleans: Historic snowfall in the region sent rats and cockroaches into homes, and mosquitoes are expected to make a \"fierce comeback\" as temperatures climb, the analysis found.",
      "Salt Lake City: Winter conditions could send house mice and white-footed mice indoors.",
      "San Antonio: \"Record-breaking warmth\" during the winter allowed mosquitoes, cockroaches and ticks to stay active, and a \"pest boom\" is expected come spring -- with a surge in bites, infestations and pest-related health concerns forecasted.",
      "Seattle: A warm, dry start to winter could lead to an increase in rodent and cockroach activity indoors and an increase in tick populations could occur with the spring rains, according to the NPMA.",
      "Washington, D.C.: A \"rollercoaster\" winter that started unusually warm and ended in heavy snowfall has made rodent activity climb significantly in the nation's capital, the report states. Tick populations could surge if spring arrives early.",
      "Florida: The group has issued a statewide warning for Florida, pointing to the Sunshine State's humid climate that allows disease-carrying pests to thrive year-round, the report stated. Although the winter brought dry, cool conditions, a surge is expected this spring as rising temperatures and humidity create ideal breeding conditions.",
      "\"We have all of the mosquito species here,\" Ryan Carney, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida's Department of Integrative Biology, told ABC News. \"There's a huge diversity, over 90 species of mosquitoes. Fourteen of those are anopheles, which spread malaria.\"",
      "Mosquitoes are the deadliest animal on the planet, killing more than 1 million people per year from the diseases they carry, and Florida is no stranger to outbreaks of mosquito-borne illness. In 2023, nearly 200 people contracted dengue fever, and there were more than 1,500 cases of Zika in the state from 2016 to 2018, Carney said.",
      "A citizen science project run by USF creates artificial intelligence algorithms to help identify and stop disease-carrying mosquitoes before they are able to infect humans and other large mammals.",
      "\"These citizen sciences, especially for mosquitoes, are a way that people can report these sightings of mosquitoes or mosquito bites, and that helps us scientists understand the biodiversity of mosquitoes in the area,\" Carney said."

      "\"Directives to halt all federal funding will make it impossible for small businesses to access critical loans and grants,\" Arensmeyer added.",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, the White House touted Trump's approach to supporting small business.",
      "\"After small business optimism hit record lows under the Biden administration, President Trump's economic policies are uplifting true 'mom and pop' businesses across the country \u2013 not government contractors making tens of millions of dollars off of taxpayers,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told ABC News. \"He will continue to cut wasteful spending, deliver transparency and usher in a new Golden Age for taxpayers, families and small business owners alike.\"",
      "Trump's push to halt federal funding included an executive order last month pausing funding for USAID, a federal foreign-aid agency.",
      "Occams Group, a technology consulting firm based in Columbia, Maryland, saw its revenue nearly cut in half this month after the Trump administration paused funding for a USAID contractor that makes up one of Occams Group's largest clients, founder and CEO Ali Sinan told ABC News.",
      "Some invoices from as far back as December remain unpaid, Sinan added, saying business with the contractor accounted for $200,000 per month in revenue. Annual revenue at Occams Group stands at more than $5 million, Sinan said.",
      "\"I was left scrambling,\" Sinan said. \"We couldn't make payroll.\"",
      "The firm cut ties with about 10 of its 50 staff members, while the remaining employees worked longer-than-normal hours as the company sought new business, he added.",
      "\"The small business is supposed to be the engine of the economy,\" Sinan said. \"My company has been left behind.\"",
      "On Feb. 13, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that lifted the pause on foreign aid. As of Friday, Sinan said Occams Group had not received payment from the client that contracts with USAID.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge found the Trump administration had violated the restraining order, calling on the White House to fulfill millions in foreign aid payments.",
      "Layoffs from private sector contractors may impact the economy faster than some federal job cuts, Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told ABC News.",
      "Federal employees who accept a buyout offered by the Trump administration are set to receive full pay through September. By contrast, private sector employees who lose their jobs could miss out on pay and benefits almost immediately, delivering a quicker blow to the economy, Pollak said.",
      "\"There's a degree of worry and concern and uncertainty that extends a lot further than the federal workforce,\" Pollak added, pointing to the pullback of federal funding as a factor in a recent decline of consumer attitudes about the economy.",
      "\"There are many, many businesses and nonprofits that get a substantial share of their budgets from the federal government, and they're now worried they may be affected by these cuts,\" Pollak said.",
      "In addition to a wide-reaching push for government spending cuts, Trump issued an executive order last month cancelling federal contracts and grants for DEI initiatives. The move aimed to \"terminate\" all \"equity-related\" contracts and grants, the order said, cutting funding for businesses that helped provide the programs.",
      "Hanaa Jiminez, who runs Gold Cardinal Consulting, a management advisory firm in Aurora, Colorado, said the federal government in recent weeks canceled all of its contracts, which accounted for $14.5 million or about 80% of the company's annual revenue.",
      "\"The first contracts to go were the DEI ones, but then the leadership and coaching ones that we were providing were also canceled,\" Jiminez said. \"It was very sad to learn.\"",
      "The company may need to layoff some of its five employees, Jiminez said, but first she will explore ways to reduce her take-home salary.",
      "\"It's really to make sure we can prevent layoffs as much as possible,\" Jiminez added.",
      "A federal judge in Maryland on Friday blocked the White House order cutting DEI grants and contracts. As of Tuesday, however, the company's contracts had not been reinstated, nor had the company received an indication that they would be, Jiminez said.",
      "The push to eradicate DEI from federal contracts has also imposed onerous compliance challenges, Christine Hopkins, who runs a pair of logistics companies in Anchorage, Alaska, told ABC News.",
      "A government official who oversees the firms' government contracts urged Hopkins to remove all mentions of DEI from hundreds of documents within a day and a half to ensure that the contracts remained in place, Hopkins said.",
      "Government contracts totaling about $7 million make up about 80% of revenue at the two companies: SCI Federal Services and Advanced Supply Chain International, she said.",
      "The DEI programs focus solely on boosting employment for military veterans and their spouses, added Hopkins, who voted for Trump.",
      "\"It was frustrating to have to respond in the short term to what I would call making the documents politically correct,\" she said, acknowledging that she supports the Trump administration's broader goal of cutting government waste.",
      "\"I'm not conceptually opposed to what is happening,\" Hendricks added. \"I'm opposed to how fast it's happening and with how little consideration.\"",

      "President Donald Trump, as he navigates trying to end the Russia-Ukraine war, is repeatedly making false claims about the amount of aid the U.S. has given to support Ukraine.",
      "He did so as he met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Monday to discuss negotiations to end the three-year conflict.",
      "\"The United States has put up far more aid for Ukraine than any other nation, hundreds of billions of dollars,\" Trump said. \"We've spent more than $300 billion, and Europe has spent about $100 billion. That's a big difference.\"",
      "Later on, in response to a question on whether the U.S. would help with reconstruction in Ukraine after the war, Trump said: \"We're in there for about $350 billion. I think that's a pretty big contribution.\"",
      "It's not the first time Trump said the U.S. has spent $350 billion toward Ukraine, though he has not cited where he's gotten that figure.",
      "Despite such reports to the contrary, Trump repeated the false claim in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon. He claimed former President Joe Biden \"spent money like nobody's ever seen: $350 billion.\"",
      "Government resources place the amount of aid appropriated by Congress for Ukraine since the war began in 2022 at $174 billion.",
      "According to the Congressional Research Service, lawmakers passed five pieces of legislation setting aside aid for Ukraine between 2022 and 2024.",
      "The funding was at first bipartisan, but as Russia's invasion continued, many Republicans began speaking out that the U.S. was doing too much to support Ukraine and aligned themselves with Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy missive.",
      "Ukraine Oversight, the website of the special inspector general for Operation Atlantic Resolve created years ago to track assistance to Ukraine, states the amount set aside for Ukraine by the U.S. is a bit higher at $182 billion.",
      "That figure includes the $174 billion appropriated by Congress and additional funds allocated from specific agencies. According to the site, $83 billion has been disbursed and another $57 billion obligated, with roughly $40 billion appropriated but not yet obligated.",
      "As for Trump's claim that the U.S. has spent more than Europe, that is also not accurate.",
      "The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a research group based in Germany that tracks support from foreign governments toward Ukraine, estimates that the U.S. has allocated about $119 billion. The reason the estimate is different from U.S. government data, the institute explains, is because it only includes direct aid to Ukraine -- not money appropriated in the bills that relate to Ukraine but are not bilateral, such restocking U.S. weapon stockpiles or aiding refugees.",
      "By comparison, Kiel found European nations have all together allocated around $138 billion to Ukraine.",
      "Trump's exaggeration of aid to Ukraine comes as his administration pushes for a deal that would give the U.S. access to profits from Ukraine's valuable mineral resources. Trump has demanded the agreement as a way for Ukraine to pay back U.S. aid during the war.",
      "\"It looks like we're getting very close,\" Trump said on Monday. \"We're, I think, getting very close to getting an agreement where we get our money back over a period of time.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine now finds itself under pressure from both Russia and the U.S.",
      "LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his leadership team spent much of 2024 cautiously courting both sides of America's widening political divide -- well aware that repelling Russia's ongoing invasion relied, in large part, on U.S. largesse.",
      "Kyiv appeared hopeful it could weather President Donald Trump's dramatic return to the White House, assuring itself and the world that his campaign trail alignment with Russia's narrative would be tempered by the geopolitical realities of the world's most powerful office.",
      "But the first month of Trump's second term has already delivered a radical American pivot. The opening of U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia -- intended to secure peace in Ukraine, but conducted without Kyiv's involvement -- and subsequent fraying of U.S.-Ukrainian ties, poses a new crisis for a nation that has grown used to living with existential peril.",
      "Volodymyr Fesenko, a political scientist and the \u0421EO of the Center for Political Studies \"Penta\" in Kyiv, told ABC News that recent developments represent \"the most acute crisis in relations between the U.S. and Ukraine in their entire history.\"",
      "\"In the worst case, this is a strategic turn of the U.S. towards Russia, rapprochement with Putin and weakening -- or even the destruction -- of previous partnership relations with Europe and Ukraine,\" Fesenko said. \"I am afraid that this is the scenario that will gradually be realized.\"",
      "\"With Trump's businesslike approach to bilateral relations, and with his interest in restoring relations with Russia, the previous special partnership relations between the U.S. and Ukraine will no longer exist,\" Fesenko said.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's commitment to involving Kyiv in any talks to end the war was embodied by the \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\" motto. That approach appears to have been replaced with Trumpian transactionalism.",
      "The White House now appears to be strongarming Kyiv into economic, territorial and political concessions, with Trump himself berating Zelenskyy -- celebrated by many Americans for his stoic wartime stewardship -- as a \"dictator without elections\" who \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and his top officials have pushed back, noting that Ukraine is unable to hold new elections while under martial law. Kyiv has said it is happy to work with the new administration on mutually beneficial economic and security deals, while urging American partners to treat Moscow's narrative with skepticism. Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday voted to affirm Zelenskyy's legitimacy and agree that no elections can be held while the war continues.",
      "The situation is \"beyond disturbing\" for Kyiv, a source close to the Ukrainian government told ABC News. \"It's hard to imagine that it can be pulled back.\"",
      "Ukraine's leadership is trying to chart a course through the minefield of Trump's second term, the source added.",
      "\"They feel that they're striking this balance of not being impolite or disrespectful when it comes to countering some of the things that, again, at the end of the day, no Ukrainian leader can accept,\" the source said.",
      "\"They feel that they're managing it well, which doesn't mean that they don't have anxiety,\" they added. \"They do, because it is a fact that they rely on U.S. support, it is a fact that Europe cannot totally compensate for that support.\"",
      "\"They're striking this balance of pushing back, but not in a way where they're coming off as totally obstructionist and obstinate,\" the source continued.",
      "This month's historic U.S.-Russia meeting in Riyadh laid bare the new administration's approach to Moscow. The two sides agreed to normalize diplomatic relations and continue talks aimed at ending Russia's war, all without Ukraine's involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's bid to win access to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Ukrainian mineral resources further unsettled Kyiv. \"We're going to get our money back,\" the president said of the would-be deal, the first draft of which Zelenskyy rejected, declaring, \"I can't sell our state.\"",
      "But after a week of intense negotiations, both sides now suggest they have all but reached a deal, with Trump saying Monday he expects to see Zelenskyy in Washington next week.",
      "The reversal of the U.S. approach is striking. Where once Biden and his team refused to engage with Moscow outside of an unprecedented sanctions campaign, Trump and his top officials are now lauding a revival in bilateral ties.",
      "Where Biden once led the \"ironclad\" commitment to defending Ukraine against Kremlin aggression \"for as long as it takes,\" Trump falsely suggested Ukraine \"should have never started\" the war.",
      "The Biden administration's steady flow of vital military and economic aid, meanwhile, has been replaced with Trump's push to recoup what he sees as poorly invested American money. \"I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up,\" Trump told CPAC on Saturday.",
      "The president has focused in on the value of American aid to Kyiv, which he claims is as high as $500 billion. Zelenskyy disputed the figure and said American aid was given as grants, not loans. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy -- a research institute in Germany that tracks foreign aid to Ukraine -- said the U.S. has contributed around $119 billion to Ukraine over three years of war. The majority -- $67 billion -- was in the form of military equipment.",
      "America's rising Ukraine-skepticism is being expressed on all fronts. In an extraordinary illustration of the re-alignment on Ukraine, the U.S. sided with Russia in a vote against a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russia, which passed on Monday with the support of the U.S.' traditional Western allies. The UN Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution which called for an end to the conflict without criticizing Russia. France and the U.K. abstained on the UNSC vote.",
      "Zelenskyy has said Ukraine will not agree to any peace deal that does not protect it against renewed Russian aggression. The Trump administration's rapid policy shift has pushed European allies to mobilize to provide their own long-term support -- and protection -- of Ukraine. Britain, France and others are discussing deploying European troops to Ukraine to guard any peace deal.",
      "Though financially and logistically dependent on foreign partners, Ukraine's armed forces are among the world's most potent and experienced. Zelenskyy said in January that 980,000 Ukrainians are now under arms, dwarfing any other European military.",
      "Despite Trump's unproven claims to the contrary, well-respected polling organizations in Ukraine have found that Zelenskyy retains the trust of the majority of Ukrainians. His compatriots want the war to end on what they consider fair terms, but a December survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll indicates that 57% are prepared to carry the conflict's burden for as long as necessary, despite heavy casualties, ongoing attacks on infrastructure and severe economic strain.",
      "There are more testing days to come. Moscow has said that the U.S. and Russian negotiating teams will meet for a second round of talks within the next two weeks.",
      "\"It should not look like Americans and Russians are trying to reach a deal about Ukraine's fate behind our backs,\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Zelenskyy's party, told ABC News.",
      "\"But what is really important for us is that such communication between Americans and Russians should not lead to the decisions concerning Ukraine,\" said Merezhko, who is also the chair of the parliament's foreign affairs committee.",
      "\"I hope that it might be a part of a political game on the part of Trump, who is trying to lure Putin into negotiations to demonstrate to his voters that he is at least trying to deliver on his promise,\" Merezhko added.",
      "\"That's why we need constant communication with Trump and his team -- if there is a vacuum, it can be filled by pro-Russian narratives.\"",
      "Yuriy Boyechko, the founder and CEO of the Hope for Ukraine charity, told ABC News he believes Trump \"is taking a side of the aggressor.\"",
      "\"Ukrainians won't sign a surrender,\" he added. \"We will keep on fighting to preserve a free and democratic Ukraine even if our top ally -- the U.S. -- walks away. We have no other choice.\"",

      "Victims of gold bar scams reported losses of $126 million in 2024.",
      "Kris Owen, a 79-year-old Vietnam veteran, had planned to spend his golden years in Indiana with his wife, Karen. They wanted to spend more time with his son and travel the world together.",
      "But she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019, and the COVID-19 pandemic hit soon after.",
      "\u201cAll of our plans for travel and everything kind of went out the window,\u201d Owen told ABC News.",
      "Two years later, Owen's wife passed away.",
      "\"Probably one of the reasons I was so susceptible to what happened to me,\" Owen said.",
      "Owen received a pop-up message on his computer in 2023 saying that his personal information was compromised -- and was told to call a phone number.",
      "When he did, an individual posing as a federal agent said they would safeguard his money and instructed him to convert some of his savings into gold bars, Owen told ABC News. After weeks of communications and after receiving what he thought was a letter from the FBI, Owen purchased $80,000 worth of gold bars.",
      "\u201cThey told me to wrap it in a box \u2026 with Christmas wrap paper,\u201d Owen said.",
      "He then took his gold to a grocery store parking lot near his house, he said, expecting to hand it over to a federal agent so the gold could be kept in a secure location. A car soon pulled up next to Owen and he placed the gold in the back seat before the driver took off.",
      "He never saw the money again.",
      "Owen soon realized that he was the victim of a scam -- and he is far from alone.",
      "As the value of gold surges, grifters have turned their sights to securing more of the precious metal in a growing scheme that defrauded Americans of some $126 million in 2024, according to the FBI.",
      "\"Gold Grifters,\" a new investigation by ABC News in collaboration with ABC stations WABC-TV and WLS-TV, found victims of the gold bar courier scam throughout the country.",
      "As victims continue to stumble upon the ruse and lose anywhere from thousands to millions of dollars each, the scheme has seemingly stunned authorities.",
      "\"I have never seen a scam to this magnitude, as intricate and as detailed as this, that can target so many individuals across the entire United States,\" Sean Petty, a detective for the Montgomery County Police Department who has investigated multiple gold bar scam cases in Maryland, told ABC News.",
      "Watch \"Gold Grifters,\" an ABC News investigation, on \"ABC News Live Prime\" at 7 p.m. ET on Feb. 25, 2025.",
      "A golden time for gold",
      "The scam involving gold bars comes as the value of the precious metal is worth more now than ever. People are stockpiling gold in record numbers, with business continuing to boom at gold stores across the country, according to the store owners.",
      "\"Everybody's buying gold as a safe haven,\" said Tony Jordan, the owner of Midwest Jewelry and Bullion in Indianapolis. \"It's a hot commodity right now for sure.\"",
      "But as the price of gold surges, scammers have taken notice.",
      "\"Everybody knows gold is worth something,\" said Chris Delzotto, section chief of the Financial Crimes unit for the FBI.",
      "Catching a courier",
      "Soon after Owen handed over some of his life savings, scammers posing as federal agents contacted him again to request more money.",
      "\"They came back and started again,\" Owen said, explaining that they'd said, \"'Now, we need to put the rest of the money away in our secure vault with your other money.'\"",
      "Owen, who was already suspicious, contacted law enforcement.",
      "\"So then we set up the sting operation,\" Owen said.",
      "The FBI and a local Indiana police department had Owen go undercover to try to catch an individual who was supposed to receive $50,000 from him. Owen, wearing a wire, met with the individual at a parking lot and placed a box with fake cash in the individual's back seat.",
      "\"And I said, 'You're my agent.' And he said, 'Yes,'\" Owen told ABC News. \"This time he spoke. And then he drove off just like before.\"",
      "Law enforcement followed the individual, who they later identified as Abdul Mohammed, and took him in for questioning. He was charged by federal prosecutors with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of wire fraud.",
      "Mohammed, who later fled the country, was a courier -- an individual recruited to pick up gold bars or cash from victims, according to law enforcement officials.",
      "The FBI says some couriers play a larger role in the criminal scheme, while others claim they were simply hired to pick up and drop off packages. Across the country, law enforcement officials and prosecutors are targeting couriers to try to put a stop to the criminal operation.",
      "An alleged courier speaks out",
      "In an exclusive phone interview, ABC News spoke to a suspected courier from jail as he faces charges in two states for his alleged involvement in gold bar schemes.",
      "Yash Shah, 27, who was originally charged with multiple felonies in 2023 related to the scam, claims he does not know where the gold is going. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years probation, but he was arrested again last November for his alleged involvement in a Maryland case. He is currently being held without bond in a New York detention facility.",
      "\"I'm not a criminal or anything like that,\" Shah told ABC News. \"I'm just a normal person. They [were] just saying \u2026 if you wanna make a little more money, you have to go pick up the package, and you have to just drop it over there. That's it.\"",
      "Shah claims he was hired by someone from India and was paid between $800 and $4,000 to pick up packages, some which contained gold bars. His attorney, Nicholas Ramcharitar, said Shah took between five and 10 trips traveling all over the Northeast as a courier.",
      "\"I want to be clear, Yash's culpability is definitely there,\" Ramcharitar told ABC News. \"He understands what he did.\"",
      "Shah said he feels guilty for playing a role in the scam and wants to help law enforcement find the \"masterminds.\"",
      "\"There are going to be many layers because they are operating from India,\" Shah said.",
      "Delzotto told ABC News the FBI is investigating call centers in India that are linked to the scam.",
      "\"These tech support pop-ups that initiate the whole scam emanate from a call center in India,\" Delzotto said. \"So we have a lot of focus on India with [a lot of] these illegitimate call centers.\"",
      "An urgent warning",
      "In the United States, as couriers are facing prison sentences, law enforcement officials are traveling to senior communities to raise awareness about the scam.",
      "\"One of the main things anybody who's [in] law enforcement can do against any scams, particularly those that target our seniors, is to advise ... and educate ... about what those scams are,\" said John McCarthy, the state's attorney for Montgomery County, Maryland.",
      "Delzotto told ABC News that because scams are getting more sophisticated, people should be cautious with messages they receive on their computer.",
      "\"Never click on sites that you're not familiar with,\" Delzotto said. \"We use the phrase 'take a beat' here. Step back. Consult with a trusted family member or friend. See if it makes sense before you engage.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump&rsquo;s effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it",
      "SEATTLE -- President Donald Trump's effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it. U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, found that while the president has broad authority over who comes into the country, he cannot nullify the law passed by Congress establishing the program.",
      "The Justice Department indicated it would consider a quick appeal, saying Trump's actions have been well within his authority.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Trump halted the nation's refugee resettlement program as part of a series of executive orders cracking down on immigration, saying cities had been taxed by \u201crecord levels of migration\u201d and couldn't \u201cabsorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.\u201d He barred refugees from coming to the U.S., and the administration began cutting off funding for agencies that support refugees.",
      "The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution \u2014 a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It is different from asylum, by which people newly arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country.",
      "Despite long-standing support from both parties for accepting refugees, the program has become politicized in recent years. Trump also temporarily halted it during his first term, and then dramatically decreased the number of refugees who could enter the U.S. each year.",
      "There are 600,000 people being processed to come to the U.S. as refugees around the world, according to the administration.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Seattle was brought by individual refugees whose efforts to resettle in the U.S. have been halted as well as major refugee aid groups.",
      "Those organizations include International Refugee Assistance Project on behalf of Church World Service, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS and Lutheran Community Services Northwest. They say they have had to lay off staff because the administration froze funding for processing refugee applications overseas as well as support, such as short-term rental assistance for those already in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe resettled people days before the inauguration that were just cut off from benefits,\u201d said Lutheran Community Services Northwest CEO David Duea said after Tuesday's hearing. \u201cThat means rent, helping kids get into school, and case management. It was an inhumane act.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer August Flentje disputed the notion that the plaintiffs had suffered the sort of \u201cirreparable\u201d harms that would warrant granting a broad order blocking the administration\u2019s actions. Most people whose travel to the U.S. was canceled at the last minute had already been moved to a third country where they were out of danger, he said, and the cancellation of funding for refugee aid groups amounted to a contract dispute.",
      "The judge disagreed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve read the declarations,\u201d Whitehead said. \u201cI have refugees stranded in dangerous places. I have families who have sold everything they\u2019ve owned in advance of travel, which was canceled. I have spouses and children separated indefinitely from their family members in the U.S., resettlement agencies that have already laid off hundreds of staff.\"",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., refused to immediately block the Trump administration\u2019s actions in a similar lawsuit brought by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. That case faces another hearing Friday.",
      "During Tuesday's arguments, Flentje cited a law that allows the president to deny entry to foreigners whose admission to the U.S. \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d",
      "But Whitehead determined the president\u2019s actions amounted to an \u201ceffective nullification of congressional will\u201d in setting up the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program. He promised to offer a fuller rationale in a written opinion in the next few days.",
      "\u201cThe president has substantial discretion ... to suspend refugee admissions,\u201d Whitehead told the parties. \u201cBut that authority is not limitless.\u201d",
      "Flentje indicated the government might file an \u201cemergency appeal\" to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a motion that would be considered on an expedited basis. He also asked the Whitehead to pause his ruling pending an appeal, but Whitehead called that request premature since he had not yet issued his written decision.",
      "Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they expected Whitehead's ruling to clear the way for money to begin flowing again to the organizations and for plaintiffs stranded overseas to be able to book new trips to the U.S., though it remained unclear whether any appeal might complicate that.",
      "Outside the courthouse Tuesday, the organizations and their supporters celebrated the ruling, describing refugees as a blessing to the country.",
      "Tshishiku Henry, an activist who works on behalf of refugees in Washington state, called his presence \u201cthe miracle of the second chance.\u201d He and his wife resettled in the U.S. in 2018 after fleeing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said.",
      "\u201cIt was a lifeline,\u201d Henry said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t offer us just safety, but you gave us back our future.\u201d"

      "Baiba Bra\u017ee spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday during a week of intense diplomacy between Europe and the United States following President Donald Trump\u2019s upending of U.S. policy with his decision to hold direct talks with Russia, while excluding Ukraine and its European allies from the initial discussions.",
      "Bra\u017ee notes that Russia, with a population of 140 million, has managed to gain control of less than 20% of Ukraine, population 40 million, since it seized Crimea in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has failed to weaken the U.S. and the NATO military alliance it leads, or to oust the democratic government in Kyiv.",
      "So, when it comes to seeking peace, \u201cI think the difficulty is with the Russians, because Russians are the ones who want to weaken U.S. power, and who want to weaken the U.S. in the world overall,\u201d Bra\u017ee said.",
      "What the world is seeing, she said, is that when Putin interferes in other countries he wants to control both territory and the political choices of their governments. In Syria, for example, he supported the authoritarian regime of Bashar Assad and got military bases on the Mediterranean.",
      "But Putin hasn't gotten what he wanted during the three-year war in Ukraine and \u201che will try to get it through the peace talks,\u201d Bra\u017ee said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to clearly remember that perspective in whatever deal we negotiate or strike.\u201d",
      "She said although only U.S. and Russian officials took part in last week's talks in Saudi Arabia, \u201cEurope is included\u201d in the peace discussions because of constant communications with both the Ukrainians and the Americans. She has been in Washington three times since mid-December and said she was heading there later Tuesday for talks with lawmakers and administration officials.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was due to meet with him on Thursday.",
      "Bra\u017ee stressed that Europe\u2019s task now is to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and build up its own militaries and defense industries.",
      "Last week, Latvia announced it will increase defense spending to 4% of GDP next year and continue to move toward 5%. NATO members have agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense.",
      "\u201cWe are investing in our own capability,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wish all Europeans would do that. That\u2019s one of the issues we are discussing.\u201d",
      "As NATO members, Bra\u017ee said, Latvia and the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania need to make sure they are prepared for any future aggression from Russia. She said their focus is on deterrence \u2014 early warning, rapid response, military capability and political will.",
      "The three Baltic states were occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II and fell under Soviet control after the war. Like Ukraine, they became independent countries with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.",
      "Bra\u017ee stressed Monday to the U.N. Security Council that \u201conly Ukraine\u2019s victory can ensure lasting security and put an end to Russia\u2019s imperialist aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe that a rushed ceasefire will not lead to sustainable peace; instead, it will only embolden Russia, encouraging further expansion and putting global security at grave risk,\u201d she said.",
      "Macron said he had spoken to 30 European and allied leaders, with some saying they are willing to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine in a peace deal.",
      "Bra\u017ee said that while there have been preliminary discussions, there is no peace process yet.",
      "When there is, she said, \u201cWe will be guided very much by the needs of Ukraine.\"",
      "\u201cFor any security force, we need military guidance,\u201d Latvia's top diplomat said. \u201cWe need military advice. What type of force is there? Where? Are the troops withdrawn on the Russian side from the contact line? How far? What is the location of any security force?\"",

      "JOLIET, Ill. -- The trial of a suburban Chicago landlord accused of murder, attempted murder and a hate crime in a 2023 attack on a Palestinian American woman and her young son is set to start Tuesday.",
      "Joseph Czuba, 73, is charged in the fatal stabbing of six-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of Hanan Shaheen on Oct. 14, 2023. Authorities said the family was targeted because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas that erupted on Oct. 7, 2023 with a Hamas attack on southern Israel.",
      "Opening statements start Tuesday morning in a trial that is expected to last about a week.",
      "Czuba has pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder and other charges. His defense attorney, George Lenard, declined to comment before the end of the trial.",
      "The attack on the family in Plainfield, nearly 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Chicago, has renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination in the Chicago area\u2019s large and established Palestinian community. The proceedings also come amid rising hostility against Muslims and Palestinians in the U.S. since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "\u201cWe firmly pray and hope that Mr. Czuba will be locked up for the rest of his life, so we can send a message that hate crimes against anyone on the basis of their religion and national origin are not tolerated,\u201d Joe Milburn, a staff attorney for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told reporters Monday ahead of jury selection.",
      "Prosecutors allege Czuba became increasing paranoid about the war because of listening to commentary on conservative talk radio. Shaheen told police that Czuba was upset over the war and attacked them after she had urged him to \u201cpray for peace.\u201d",
      "The boy \u2014 whose name was initially spelled Wadea Al-Fayoume by authorities \u2014 was stabbed 26 times. Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds and it took her weeks to recover.",
      "The murder charge in the indictment against Czuba describes the boy\u2019s death as the result of \u201cexceptionally brutal or heinous behavior.\u201d Czuba remained detained with prosecutors arguing that Czuba was a danger to Shaheen and others.",
      "Hundreds attended the boy\u2019s janazah, or funeral service, where the boy was remembered as kind and into sports and Legos.",
      "Separately, the father of the boy, who is divorced from Shaheen and did not live at the home, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit."

      "A Denver family alleges that a police SWAT team mistakenly raided their apartment in June 2023, forcing a mother and a grandmother out at gunpoint and then terrifying two young girls who were still inside the home",
      "DENVER -- Kirsty Shelton was at home preparing lunch and watching television with her daughters and their grandmother when they were startled by loud banging on their apartment door by a SWAT team looking for a man who lived across the hall. Shelton's mother told them they had the wrong apartment but, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the Denver officers, she and her daughter were ordered outside at gunpoint.",
      "When the officers then entered the apartment, they encountered two girls, ages 5 and 6, in their bedroom. According to the body camera footage of the June 2023 incident, an officer told them they could play there and that he would get their grandmother, but the girls began to scream.",
      "Police then put the family, including another adult who had just gotten out of the shower, into a locked police car for about an hour and took over their apartment as they continued to search for the suspect, according to the lawsuit. It says police knew the man they were looking for lived in apartment 307, not 306 where the Shelton family lived, and that the numbers were clearly marked. It claims police didn't admit to making a mistake but instead denied the raid ever happened.",
      "The operation's commander wrote in an after-action report that, due to the layout of the apartment building, the family was \u201ccontacted, advised of the situation and evacuated for their own safety,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "Shelton said the police officers' actions traumatized her family and required them to get extensive counseling.",
      "\"The police promised an investigation but instead covered up the raid, failing to produce their report to this day, over a year and a half after the incident. They continue to pretend that this terrifying raid never happened,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Police didn't immediately respond to requests seeking comment about the lawsuit.",
      "Two of the Shelton family's lawyers, John Holland and Dan Weiss, said some reports by individual officers failed to mention that they even went into the family's apartment as they searched for a suspect who was wanted for serious violent crimes. The man was arrested hours later in the apartment directly opposite theirs, the lawsuit says.",
      "Holland and Weiss filed the lawsuit in state court under Colorado's 2020 police reform law, which does not allow officers to try to block lawsuits under the claim of qualified immunity, as they can in federal court. It alleges that at least 10 officers violated the family's constitutional right to be free of unlawful searches and seizures, and that the family was subjected to excessive force.",
      "It\u2019s rare for SWAT teams to enter the wrong location, said Thor Eells, a former SWAT member and commander for the Colorado Springs Police Department and the executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association. Nationally, instances of tactical teams going into wrong locations has significantly decreased in the last decade mainly because of better training and a move away from hasty drug-related operations, he said.",
      "But when police do make a mistake and suspect they\u2019ve entered the wrong location, they can\u2019t immediately just back away because the location needs to be searched to make sure there are no threats, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce they start the entry, they\u2019re not going to stop until they secure the apartment for the safety of everyone involved,\u201d said Eells, who declined to comment on the Denver case.",
      "Experts in tactical operations say sending a SWAT team to arrest someone in an apartment building is challenging because people move in and out frequently, unit numbers can be unclear and gunshots can pass into another unit.",
      "When time allows, officers can do surveillance, get the target location's floor plans and send someone to check it out before an operation, said Mark Lomax, former executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired major for the Pennsylvania State Police."

      "Amanda Hergenreder took the dog on a two-hour drive to her clinic, where she performed procedures to relieve a severe urinary tract infection and remove a rotten tooth. She named him Biggby and says the 16-year-old pit bull mix is thriving nearly four months later.",
      "But the Kent County prosecutor said Biggby belongs to Chris Hamilton, who lately lacks a permanent home in the Grand Rapids area and claims ownership of a dog known to him as his beloved Vinny.",
      "\u201cI just want my dog back,\u201d Hamilton, 57, told WOOD-TV. \u201cI had my dog 15 years. Never neglected him and, you know, we loved each other. I mean, I felt like I lost part of my body after that. Never felt the same after losing him.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor Chris Becker said it is a simple case of larceny, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum sentence of 93 days in jail. Jury selection for a future trial is scheduled for March 6.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have a right to just take something because you feel something\u2019s wrong. ... People have a very big attachment to their animals,\u201d Becker told the TV station. \u201cNo matter where you are in life, what your stature is in life, be it rich, poor, whatever it is, this is something that\u2019s important to an individual.\u201d",
      "Hergenreder said she was in Grand Rapids in November for a professional conference when she saw the dog tied to a truck near a Biggby coffee shop. There is no dispute that she called the police department and animal shelter and also talked to a shop employee.",
      "\u201cNo energy, very lethargic,\" Hergenreder said of the dog. \"We carried him to our vehicle. It was just very sad.\u201d",
      "Hergenreder said she performed medical procedures at her clinic worth $3,000. She said he runs and plays at her home, adding that she is \"starting to slowly see the light come back in his eyes.\u201d",
      "Hamilton acknowledged that he tied the dog to the truck while he walked to a gas station. He said when he returned, about 45 minutes later, coffee shop employees told him \"some lady in a van came and took my dog, snipped the rope.\u201d",
      "Hergenreder's attorney, Miles Greengard, is offering a vigorous defense of the veterinarian. He said she fears the dog won't get the attention he needs in old age if she gives him up.",
      "\u201cMr. Hamilton didn\u2019t even take such basic steps as licensing the dog,\u201d Greengard told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \u201cNow he expects a benevolent doctor to give Biggby the medical treatment he\u2019s been denied and needs moving forward, and then give the dog back?",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an unfortunate situation all the way around,\u201d Greengard said. \"But I\u2019m glad Biggby is living his best life.\u201d"

      "The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by major refugee aid groups, who argued that Trump's executive order suspending the federal refugee resettlement program ran afoul of the system Congress created for moving refugees into the U.S.",
      "Lawyers for the administration argued that Trump\u2019s order was well within his authority to deny entry to foreigners whose admission to the U.S. \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead said in his ruling after the hearing Tuesday that the president\u2019s actions amounted to an \u201ceffective nullification of congressional will\u201d in setting up the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program.",
      "\u201cThe president has substantial discretion ... to suspend refugee admissions,\u201d Whitehead told the parties. \u201cBut that authority is not limitless.\u201d",

      "The plaintiffs include the International Refugee Assistance Project on behalf of Church World Service, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS, Lutheran Community Services Northwest, and individual refugees and family members. They said their ability to provide critical services to refugees \u2014 including those already in the U.S. \u2014 has been severely inhibited by Trump\u2019s order.",
      "Some refugees who had been approved to come to the U.S. had their travel canceled on short notice, and families who have waited years to reunite have had to remain apart, the lawsuit said.",
      "Trump\u2019s recent order said the refugee program \u2014 a form of legal migration to the U.S. \u2014 would be suspended because cities and communities had been taxed by \u201crecord levels of migration\u201d and didn\u2019t have the ability to \u201cabsorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.\u201d",
      "The federal refugee program has been in place for decades and helps people who have escaped war, natural disaster or persecution. Despite long-standing support from both parties for accepting thoroughly vetted refugees, the program has become politicized in recent years.",

      "After his October 2021 indictment, Kelsey deemed the case a witch hunt and blamed the Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden. But when a co-defendant pleaded guilty the following October, Kelsey quickly did the same.",
      "Afterward, Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind the guilty plea.",
      "Kelsey argued he should be allowed to go back on his guilty plea because he entered it with an \u201cunsure heart and a confused mind\u201d due to events in his personal life; he and his wife were caring for twin sons born in September 2022, and his father had terminal pancreatic cancer, then died in February 2023.",

The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",
      "The indictment resembles a 2017 complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice by a nonprofit, the Campaign Legal Center, which named the American Conservative Union as making coordinated independent expenditures with Kelsey's campaign. The American Conservative Union has said it has cooperated with investigators.",

      "Tens of thousands of planes take off, land and perform touch-and-goes at the Marana Regional Airport in southern Arizona every year. Without an air traffic control tower, it's a calculated dance that requires communication by pilots.",
      "Two small planes collided in midair over one of the runways on the outskirts of Tucson last week. One hit the ground and caught fire, sending up a plume of black smoke. The remains of two people were found in the charred wreckage. The other plane was able to land, with those occupants uninjured.",
      "The collision was the latest aviation mishap to draw attention in recent weeks. The circumstances vary widely with each case, however, and experts who study aviation accidents say they don\u2019t see any connection between them.",
      "Chatter over the airwaves has provided some clues about what happened in Arizona. A chief flight instructor who was in the air with a student that day heard the commotion over the radio: One plane was attempting a touch-and-go when another clipped its propeller while attempting to land.",
      "Erwin Castillo, who works for IFLY Pilot Training, recalled hearing one pilot scream: \u201cMayday! Mayday! Mayday! He just hit us.\u201d",
      "It will be up to federal investigators to determine what caused the crash, a detailed process that will take months.",
      "While some observers suggest having a control tower may have made a difference, experts say not having a tower doesn\u2019t mean the airport is any less safe; pilots just have a different set of communication procedures to follow.",
      "Of the 5,100 public airports across the country, only about 10% have towers staffed by people who direct the flow of traffic. These are the busiest of airports, with complex operations and large volumes of commercial flights.",
      "For the airports without control towers, pilots rely on radio communications and the principle of \u201csee and avoid\u201d to ensure they can maneuver safely. The concept is drilled into pilots from Day 1 of their training and it's applicable regardless of the kind of airspace they're in, said Mike Ginter, a retired Navy aviator and senior vice president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association\u2019s Air Safety Institute.",
      "He likened it to being behind the wheel of a car and practicing all the safety rules learned in driver's ed.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell the state police that you\u2019re getting ready to drive to the supermarket to get groceries. You just go out, and you look both ways before you turn, and you turn on your turn signal and you drive,\u201d he explained, saying there are basic tenets of safety that are ingrained in pilots.",
      "The system has worked well, considering the sheer number of planes coming and going daily from small airports and the roughly 26 million hours of flight time logged by general aviation pilots.",
      "It was a summer day in 1956 when two commercial flights left Los Angeles within minutes of each other \u2014 one en route to Chicago and the other to Kansas. Flying under visual flight rules, the planes collided over the Grand Canyon in Arizona, killing all 128 people aboard. The crash site is now a National Historic Landmark.",
      "Even though U.S. air traffic had more than doubled since the end of World War II, it was this disaster that helped to fuel efforts to overhaul aviation safety.",
      "Legislation was introduced in 1958 to create an independent federal agency that would provide for the safe and efficient use of national airspace. The bill was signed within months and the first Federal Aviation Agency administrator was appointed.",
      "Responsibilities evolved, and the agency became the Federal Aviation Administration as air traffic control systems were being modernized.",
      "Through the FAA, airports can apply for federal grants to modernize and build air traffic control towers that are staffed by private companies and contract workers, rather than FAA staff.",
      "Nearly 180 airports nationwide are eligible for funding under the program, with most looking to upgrade existing towers \u2014 some that date back to the 1940s and others that were meant to be temporary.",
      "A review of funding awarded through the program over the past four fiscal year shows a handful of airports were awarded money specifically for site studies, environmental work and construction of new towers. That includes airports in Bend, Oregon; Boulder City, Nevada; and Mankato, Minnesota.",
      "In the case of Marana, the airport was first accepted into the program in 2019 but the coronavirus pandemic stalled efforts to get a tower built by the five-year deadline. Airport officials have said they now are on track to complete the project by 2029.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump issued a memo in late January to top transportation officials, ordering an immediate assessment of aviation safety following the midair collision of an Army helicopter and commercial passenger jet over the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. Sixty-seven people were killed.",
      "Trump raised questions about hiring practices within the FAA, suggesting previous Democratic administrations had shifted away from merit-based hiring.",

      "In addition, the administration has said no air traffic controllers or critical safety personnel were fired as part of the effort. But labor and industry groups say even without cuts, air traffic control towers were already understaffed.",
      "Trump has said that he would support legislation aimed at modernizing the nation's air traffic control system.

      "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- The lawyer for a Southern California judge acknowledged Monday that his client fired the deadly shot that killed his wife but contended it was an accident.",
      "Orange County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Ferguson sat in the courtroom about 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from where he previously presided over criminal cases, waiting for his turn to testify in his own trial. The 74-year-old judge is charged with the murder of his wife, Sheryl, for shooting her in August 2023 after the couple had been arguing about family finances while watching \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d on television.",
      "Ferguson\u2019s lawyer, Cameron J. Talley, said his client was an alcoholic and had been drinking when he began removing a gun he always carried with him in an ankle holster and went to place it on a table. Talley said Ferguson fumbled the gun, then reached to grab it and it went off with a \"bang.\"",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in shock,\u201d Talley told jurors, and called the shot an \u201caccidental discharge.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dreamlike to him, and it doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s a little drunk.\u201d",
      "The comments came during Talley\u2019s opening statement in a case that has roiled the legal community in Orange County, which is home to 3 million people between Los Angeles and San Diego. Ferguson, who is expected to testify this week, has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.",
      "Prosecutors allege Ferguson made a gun hand gesture toward his wife earlier in the evening after the couple argued about family finances while dining at a Mexican restaurant with their adult son, Phillip. Prosecutor Seton Hunt said the arguing continued at home until Sheryl Ferguson chided her husband to point a real gun at her, after which he did and pulled the trigger.",
      "Ferguson was taken into custody, and in comments captured on a police video recording, pleaded for a jury to convict him.",
      "\u201cI killed her,\u201d Ferguson is heard saying. \u201cI did it.\u201d",
      "Ferguson, who used to be a criminal prosecutor, has cried from his seat at the defense table during the trial. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eleanor J. Hunter, who is presiding over the case to avoid a conflict of interest, warned he won't be allowed to sob from the witness stand. \u201cHe's got to control himself,\u201d she said.",
      "The trial has included extensive footage from cameras worn by police officers who arrived at the couple's home in Anaheim Hills after the shooting. There is also video footage of Ferguson handcuffed at the police station following his arrest, in which he's seen sobbing and saying his son and everyone would hate him.",
      "Authorities said they found 47 weapons, including the gun from Ferguson's ankle holster, and more than 26,000 rounds of ammunition at the home. Hunt said Ferguson had ample experience and training in operating firearms, and Phillip Ferguson testified that his father taught him firearm safety, including to always point a weapon in a safe direction.",
      "Immediately after the shooting, Jeffrey Ferguson and his son both called 911, and Ferguson texted his court clerk and bailiff saying, \u201cI just lost it. I just shot my wife. I won\u2019t be in tomorrow. I will be in custody. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d according to a copy of a text message Hunt showed jurors.",
      "Ferguson was released on $1 million bail in 2023 but re-arrested last year after Hunter found he had lied about drinking alcohol in violation of his bail conditions. Ferguson was later released on $2 million bail.",
      "Ferguson has been an elected judge in Orange County for a decade but is not currently hearing cases. Under the state\u2019s constitution, a judge who faces a felony charge can continue to draw a salary but can\u2019t hear cases.",
      "Ferguson began his legal career in the district attorney\u2019s office in 1983 and went on to work narcotics cases, for which he won various awards, and was president of the North Orange County Bar Association from 2012 to 2014.",
      "He was admonished by the Commission on Judicial Performance in 2017 for posting a statement on Facebook about a judicial candidate \u201cwith knowing or reckless disregard for the truth of the statement,\u201d and for being Facebook friends with attorneys appearing before him in court, according to a copy of the agency\u2019s findings.",

      "President Donald Trump says his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month, ending a monthlong suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that\u2019s moving along very rapidly,\u201d the U.S. president said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "While Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the U.S. president also stressed more broadly that his intended \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs. His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation. But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.",
      "\u201cOur country will be extremely liquid and rich again,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In a interview on the Fox News show \u201cSpecial Report\u201d late Monday, Macron said he hoped he had convinced Trump to avoid a possible trade war, noting the difficulty of taking on a traditional ally such as Europe while simultaneously using tariffs to challenge China's industrial might.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need a trade war,\" Marcon said. \"We need more prosperity together.\u201d",
      "Most economists say the cost of the taxes could largely be borne by consumers, retailers and manufacturers such as auto companies that source globally and rely on raw materials such as steel and aluminum that Trump is already, separately, tariffing at 25%.",
      "Still, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared confident Monday that her administration would reach agreements with the U.S. government before the deadline set by Trump.",
      "\u201cWe would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,\u201d Sheinbaum told reporters Monday morning before Trump's remarks. \u201cOn all of the issues there is communication and what we need is to complete this agreement, I believe we\u2019re in a place to do it.\u201d",
      "If necessary, she said she would seek to speak directly with Trump again. In high-level discussions between both governments, Mexico has insisted that the U.S. also take a hard look at the drug distribution and consumption in its own country rather than pointing only at production in Mexico, Sheinbaum said.",
      "Companies like Walmart have warned about uncertainty, while the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment index plunged by roughly 10% over the past month in part due to fears about tariffs and inflation worsening. In the 2024 presidential election, voters backed Trump on the belief that he could cool inflation that had spiked to a four-decade high in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic during President Joe Biden's time in office.",
      "But Trump has persistently threatened tariffs and kept up those calls even as Macron, standing beside him, had previously suggested that talks on trade had produced some common ground.",
      "\u201cWe want to make a sincere commitment towards a fair competition where we have smooth trade and more investments,\u201d Macron said at the news conference, according to a translation of his French remarks.",
      "Macron said the idea is to help the U.S. and Europe both prosper, saying that further talks would be carried out by their respective teams to flesh out their ideas.",
      "Investors, businesses and the broader public are still trying to determine whether Trump is merely threatening tariffs as a negotiating tool or if he sincerely backs the tax hikes as a way to offset his planned income tax cuts.",
      "Despite talks the Trump administration has held with Canadian and Mexican officials, the U.S. president signaled Monday that he would end the 30-day suspension of tariffs that were initially set to take effect in February. Trump plans to tax imports from Mexico at 25% as well as most goods from Canada, with energy products such as Canadian oil and electricity being tariffed at a lower 10%.",
      "Trump is placing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods with the stated goal of pressuring them to do more to address illegal immigration and the smuggling of illicit drugs such as fentanyl. While relatively little fentanyl comes from Canada, the country announced a czar to address the issue and appease Trump in addition to existing measures. Mexico has relocated 10,000 members of its National Guard to the border with the United States in addition to existing measures.",
      "Trump also plans to impose new tariffs to match the rates charged by other countries. Set to begin as soon as April, the tariffs could be higher than what other countries would charge as subsidies, regulatory barriers and the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax common in Europe \u2014 would be included in the calculations.",
      "The possibility of retaliatory tariffs planned by Canada, Mexico and Europe could lead to a broader trade conflict that sabotage growth. In February, the Yale University Budget Lab estimated that the Canadian and Mexican tariffs could depress average U.S. incomes by $1,170 to $1,245 a year.",

      "New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official said Saturday.",
      "Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies in an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that has long drawn the ire of conservatives.",
      "The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the move before it's announced publicly. White House officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening.",
      "Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate approval despite Democrats' concerns about the steadfast Trump ally's plans to radically overhaul the FBI.",
      "ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations.",
      "The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News.",
      "The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was \u201ctargeting gun owners.\u201d Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the \u201chighest honor\u201d of her career.",
      "Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores.",
      "In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms \u201cto assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.\u201d",
      "Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a \u201cknown gun rights extremist.\u201d Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director \u201ca major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide.\"",
      "The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process."

      "NEW YORK -- The ubiquitous food delivery app DoorDash will pay almost $17 million to settle claims that it unfairly used customer tips to subsidize the wages of its delivery workers in New York, rather than letting drivers keep the tips on top of their guaranteed pay, Attorney General Letitia James said Monday.",
      "James said DoorDash used the wage model between May 2017 and September 2019. The company would guarantee workers a base payment for each delivery but was factoring tips into that equation, only paying workers for whatever the tips didn't cover, according to the attorney general.",
      "DoorDash also did not make it clear to customers that their tips were being used to offset worker wages, said James, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cThis is just fundamentally unfair,\u201d she said at a news conference in Manhattan. \u201dCustomers had no reason to believe that these tips were being used by DoorDash to reduce its costs.\"",
      "The company will pay $16.75 million in restitution that will be distributed to DoorDash workers who made deliveries between May 2017 and September 2019 in New York. Eligible workers will be contacted by a settlement administrator.",
      "In a statement, DoorDash said, \"While we believe that our practices properly represented how Dashers were paid during this period, we are pleased to have resolved this years-old matter and look forward to continuing to offer a flexible way for millions of people to reach their financial goals.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Republican state lawmakers seeking to aid President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration are threatening local officials who resist with lawsuits, fines and even potential jail time.",
      "Lawmakers in more than 20 states this year have filed legislation targeting so-called sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Some of those states already ban sanctuary policies but are now proposing to punish mayors, council members and other government officials who violate the prohibition.",
      "The goal is to provide \u201cteeth to those who are being aggrieved by local governments and local officials who are not abiding by Georgia immigration law,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Blake Tillery, whose legislation would allow lawsuits against anyone who implements sanctuary policies. His bill recently passed the Senate and is now in the House.",
      "Opponents have raised concerns that the legislation could lead local police and sheriffs to detain immigrants for longer than they are supposed to under federal law out of fear of getting sued.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re threatening our local law enforcement who are doing the best job they can to keep our communities safe,\u201d said Georgia state Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Democrat.",
      "The state proposals come as the Trump administration also has begun taking legal action against governments that have adopted policies inhibiting arrests and deportations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Department of Justice has sued Illinois, Chicago and Cook County, alleging they are violating federal law by not cooperating with immigration authorities.",
      "A Georgia law enacted last year already mandates that local law enforcement cooperate with federal authorities to identify and detain immigrants in the U.S. illegally, or else lose state funding and face misdemeanor charges. The legislation recently passed by the state Senate doubles down by letting people sue local governments, officials and employees for violating the ban.",
      "Immigrants and advocates in Georgia say the legislation, if passed, could stoke fear in communities already worried about ICE officials arresting loved ones in homes, churches or schools.",
      "\"This all relates to Donald Trump\u2019s war on immigrants and local people trying to garner favor with him through legislation that doesn\u2019t solve any problems,\u201d said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta immigration attorney who opposes the legislation.",

      "Louisiana passed a law last year requiring law enforcement agencies to \u201cuse best efforts\u201d to enforce federal immigration law. Earlier this month, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill sued the sheriff\u2019s office in New Orleans, alleging it is violating the state ban on sanctuary immigration policies.",
      "The Orleans Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office declines ICE requests to hold detainees for extra time except when they face murder, rape, kidnapping, treason or robbery charges, according to a 2013 policy put in place under a consent judgment in federal court. The attorney general\u2019s lawsuit seeks to end that federal court order.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office also restricts the information it shares with ICE and prevents federal immigration agents from entering its facilities without court authorization or interviewing detainees without legal counsel.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office said in an emailed statement that it \u201cremains in full compliance with all applicable state laws and valid court orders related to ICE detainers.\u201d",
      "An anti-sanctuary measure was the first item signed into law by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden of South Dakota after he took over for former Gov. Kristi Noem, who was picked by Trump to be homeland security secretary. The law bans state and local policies that limit communication with federal officials about people\u2019s immigration status, however it contains no penalties.",
      "Other states have gone further. A sweeping immigration law signed recently by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis requires the attorney general to take legal action against local governments that adopt policies refusing to comply with federal requests to detain immigrants in the country illegally. Local officials who willfully violate a ban on such sanctuary policies can face fines up to $5,000.",
      "Tennessee law already denies state economic development funds to local governments that violate a ban on sanctuary policies. A law signed recently by Gov. Bill Lee enhances that by subjecting local officials who vote for such policies to felony charges punishable by up to six years in prison. Legislative attorneys have said such penalties could be unconstitutional due to protections afforded elected officials while carrying out their duties.",
      "Legislation that passed the Wyoming House and is now pending in the Senate would not only bar local governments from adopting immigration sanctuary policies but also block citizens from proposing them through initiative petitions. The measure contains steep penalties. The governor could withhold state funds from counties, cities and towns that adopt such policies. Local officials who refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities could face felony charges punishable by 5-10 years in prison and a fine up to $20,000.",
      "Republican state Rep. Joel Guggenmos acknowledged there are no sanctuary jurisdictions in Wyoming but told colleagues during a committee hearing that he was sponsoring the legislation as a preemptive measure.",
      "\u201cAs I look at other states, this is becoming a problem,\u201d Guggenmos said.",
      "New Hampshire lawmakers have advanced two separate bills targeting sanctuary policies. A Senate version would allow the state attorney general to sue local governments that prohibit the enforcement of federal immigration laws and seek fines equal to 25% of their state funding. A House version omits the fine but includes more detailed directives for local governments to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.",

      "The leaders of France and Britain are making tag-team visits to Washington this week",
      "LONDON -- The leaders of France and Britain are making tag-team visits to Washington this week as Europe attempts to persuade President Donald Trump not to abandon Ukraine in pursuit of a peace deal in the three-year-old war with Russia.",
      "There is an element of good cop, bad cop in efforts by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron to salvage American support for Kyiv.",
      "Starmer, reluctant to openly confront Trump, speaks of being a bridge between Europe and the U.S. administration. Macron has more strongly criticized Trump\u2019s recent statements that echo Russia\u2019s narrative and American moves to negotiate with Moscow while sidelining Ukraine.",
      "Both leaders stress Ukraine's voice and sovereignty must be at the center of any peace talks.",
      "The French president warned Trump against appearing \u201cweak in the face of President Putin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s not your trademark, it\u2019s not in your interest,\u201d said Macron, who is due at the White House on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Starmer is set to follow on Thursday.",
      "The trips come after Macron called a crisis meeting of European leaders in Paris last week to discuss the continent\u2019s next steps \u2014 and after Trump on Friday claimed Macron and Starmer \u201chaven\u2019t done anything\u201d over the past three years to end the war.",
      "The centrist French leader, known for his bold diplomatic moves, says he\u2019ll seek to persuade Trump that American and European interests are the same, telling him: \u201cIf you let Russia take over Ukraine, it would be unstoppable.\u201d",
      "Starmer, a cautious center-left politician, has avoided directly contradicting Trump or criticizing his actions. The U.K. joined the U.S. in refusing to sign a joint declaration at an Artificial Intelligence summit hosted by Macron in Paris this month in what was seen as an attempt to curry favor with Washington.",
      "But the prime minister has reaffirmed Britain\u2019s support for Ukraine, rejecting Trump\u2019s assertion that Zelenskyy is a \u201cdictator\u201d and the president's suggestion that Kyiv started the war, which erupted when Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Starmer spoke to Zelenskyy on Saturday, expressing \u201cthe U.K.\u2019s ironclad support for Ukraine and commitment to securing a just and enduring peace.\u201d He said he would stress \u201csafeguarding Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty\u201d when he speaks to Trump in Washington.",
      "Some historians say the idea that Britain can be a transatlantic bridge is built on shaky foundations.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018special relationship\u2019 has always been more important from the British end,\u201d said Oxford University history professor Margaret MacMillan. \u201cWhen it comes right down to it, great powers tend to do what suits them.\u201d",
      "She said the bottom line for Macron and Starmer \u201cis they want the U.S. to stay involved in Europe. Whether they can achieve that is another matter.\u201d",
      "Macron and Starmer will say in Washington that Ukraine must be at the table for negotiations on its future. They hope to get U.S. support for an emerging plan to have Europe deploy troops in a \u201creassurance force\u201d to help guarantee Ukraine\u2019s future security. Starmer has stressed that the plan will only work if there is a U.S. \u201cbackstop,\u201d likely in the form of American air power, to deter Russia from attacking again.",
      "Trump may well be skeptical. He has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don\u2019t pull their weight.",
      "Both Macron and Starmer appear ready to answer Trump\u2019s call to boost defense spending. France spends just over 2% of its gross domestic product on the military, and Macron said last week that Europeans \u201cmust increase our war effort.\u201d",
      "Britain spends 2.3% of gross domestic product on defense, and Starmer has said that will rise to 2.5%. He may put a date for reaching that target during his Washington trip.",
      "Jamie Shea, a retired senior NATO official, said Starmer should try to appeal to Trump\u2019s keen sense of his place in history.",
      "\u201cThe main argument Starmer can put will be to say, \u2018Mr. President this is going to be your peace agreement. You did it and for better or worse you will be associated with it forever. And do you want to risk a failure?\u2019\u201d Shea said.",
      "Trade \u2014 and an effort to avoid U.S.-imposed tariffs \u2014 will also be on the agenda for both Macron and Starmer.",
      "Trump has ordered reciprocal import taxes on America\u2019s trading partners, slapped 10% tariffs on China; effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum; and threatened, then delayed for 30 days, 25% taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "U.K. officials hope Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union \u2014 a move Trump has praised \u2014 and relatively balanced trade with the U.S. will help it avoid harsh tariffs.",
      "Starmer also wants to raise U.K. opposition to Trump\u2019s suggestion that Palestinians be deported from Gaza so the U.S. can take over the territory. And he will seek to allay U.S. concerns about a U.K. agreement to cede to Mauritius the Chagos Islands, an Indian Ocean archipelago that\u2019s home to a strategic U.S. military base.",

      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",

    "story": [
      "Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January.",
      "The drop in Tesla shares took the company's valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024.",
      "Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.",
      "In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.",
      "Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.",
      "Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more that 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.",
      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",
      "Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.",
      "However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said.",
      "Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.",
      "In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised prime minister Sir Keir Starmer.",
      "Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections.",
      "Too toxic?",
      "Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".",
      "\"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\"",
      "Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president.",
      "Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.",
      "However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.",
      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",
      "There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added."

    "story": [
      "Apple boss Tim Cook has said his company may have to change its diversity practices as the US legal landscape shifts.",
      "His comments came just minutes after a majority of shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the tech giant to consider ending its diversity policies, such as the use of race and sex in hiring decisions.",
      "Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was  \"inappropriately\" trying \"to micromanage\" its business.",
      "The scrutiny of the firm comes as US President Donald Trump has called for an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the government and private sector.",
      "Trump's orders have run into legal roadblocks, but many companies in the US, including big names such as Meta, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, have already ended or rolled back their own policies, citing legal risks.",

      "Shareholder measures opposed by companies rarely succeed, so the outcome of Tuesday's vote was expected.",

      "However, despite the vote, Mr Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that the firm may have to alter some of its practices.",
      "\"As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\" Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company's annual shareholder meeting.",
      "He noted that Apple did not use \"quotas\" for hiring - a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism - while saying the firm's strength came from a culture where \"people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together\".",
      "\"We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" he added, saying the company would remain \"committed to the values that have always made us who we are\".",
      "The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco.",
      "It argued that the existence of Apple's diversity and inclusion programmes exposed the firm to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\", pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination.",
      "Stefan Padfield of the organisation's Free Enterprise Project, who presented the proposal at Tuesday's meeting, said the risks to Apple had increased after the Trump administration recently ordered staff to investigate DEI in the private sector.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear,\" he said. \"DEI is out and merit is in.\"",
      "Apple's decision to push back against the shareholder proposal, while simultaneously opening the door to changing its policy is likely to satisfy both sides of the fight, said Angela Jackson, a senior advisor to the Project on Workforce at Harvard University and author of the forthcoming book, The Win-Win Workplace.",
      "But she warned that it left Apple \"playing defence\". She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes.",
      "\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"",
      "The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges.",
      "Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks.",
      "\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.",
      "\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"",
      "Shareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse.",
      "They backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m."

    "story": [
      "Energy costs are one of a number of bill rises which will come into force at the start of what some commentators have described as \"awful April\".",
      "The exact amount you pay will depend on your individual circumstances, and where you live.",
      "Although minimum wages will increase from April, and wages on average have been outpacing inflation, household finances could still come under extra pressure.",
      "Here are seven ways in which you could be affected.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are due to go up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming in April.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are set to rise by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",
      "Domestic customers in Northern Ireland are not billed for water, with the system funded by the devolved government.",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will go up \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but it depends on where you live.",
      "Ofgem is suggesting households consider a fixed tariff for a bit of stability, even though there's speculation of prices dropping in July.",
      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority will go up from April.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Bradford, Newham, Birmingham, Somerset, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning they could raise council tax by more.",
      "Council tax rates in Scotland have been frozen or had limited increases since 2007, but they are expected to go up in April, in some cases by as much as 10%.",
      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates could jump by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",
      "Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system instead of council tax. All of Northern Ireland's councils have reported district rate increases for the next year.",
      "4. Car tax",
      "From April, the standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 rises \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, based on the inflation rate last December, plus an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence will also go up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, and for a black and white TV it will go up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Stamp duty",
      "House buyers in England and Northern Ireland will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000 in April, instead of over \u00a3250,000 at the moment.",
      "First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this will drop to \u00a3300,000.",
      "Anyone starting a search for a property now would likely struggle to move before the stamp duty changes.",
      "7. Hidden tax rises",
      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax - as governments don't explicitly label it as a tax.",
      "But the policy amounts to a tax rise because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rises.",
      "According to figures from the government's financial watchdog by 2028-29, nearly four million additional people will be expected to pay income tax - and three million more will have moved to the higher rate - due to the threshold being frozen.",

      "Nuclear scientists believe they have found a way to transform the supply of vital material used for scanning cancer patients.",

      "Dr Tom Wallace-Smith, technical director of Bristol's Astral Systems, said they developed a technique that produces the material here in the UK.",
      "He said this has the potential to \"eliminate the delays that have plagued\" cancer treatments.",
      "The team in Bristol have come up with a whole new approach, using nuclear fusion rather than fission.",
      "And rather than requiring a new nuclear plant, which would cost about \u00a3400m to build, they can develop the material in small plants \"right by hospitals\" for about \u00a31m, Dr Wallace-Smith said.",
      "Every year, radiologists scan about 300,000 patients using these radioactive radioisotopes, with consultants saying they would not be able to do their work without them.",
      "In October, the world of nuclear medicine was hit by a major crisis. Outside the niche speciality, few noticed because doctors and health managers implemented a rapidly assembled rationing system for vital scans.",
      "Britain gets all of its supply from three reactors in Europe. In October two of them shut down for planned maintenance at the same time, and then the third sprung a fault.",
      "\"Something like 75% of our supply was lost,\" said Dr Stephen Harden, from the Royal College of Radiologists.",
      "All patients needing urgent diagnostic scans were seen on time, but thousands of more routine check-ups were delayed.",
      "The interruption only lasted three weeks, but it highlighted what Dr Harden called the \"ageing and fragile\" supply chain.",
      "He explained: \"It makes a really strong case for making these radioisotopes in the UK.\"",
      "In 2017 a UK Government report said six nuclear reactors made 85% of the radioisotopes used worldwide. By 2030, five of them will be retired.",
      "Many of these reactors were built in the 1960s and 1970s.  Building a new one is expensive and takes years.",
      "In North Wales, there are plans to build such a reactor, which will cost \u00a3400m.",
      "Like all nuclear fission plants, they are controversial. Their raw material is uranium, and the radioisotopes they produce are, by design, radioactive.",
      "Astral Systems has developed technology that can now make the same radioisotopes used in hospitals, on demand.",
      "Small reactors could be built for under \u00a31m, less than the price of the scanner that uses the radioactive product.",
      "Now, the team is building a new kind of fusion reactor, which will be able to produce any kind of radioisotope for research or medicine, right by the hospitals that need it.",
      "At the Bristol Royal Infirmary, I watched as a patient lay on the scanner bed, ready for his session. He was fully clothed, but the vital preparation was internal.",
      "\"Three hours before the scan, we inject patients with a tiny amount of radioactivity,\" explained consultant radiologist, Dr Randeep Kulshrestha.",
      "The radioisotope is tagged to substances that will go to whatever area doctors are interested in, for example the bones.",
      "The camera will then pick up the radioactivity in such a way that doctors can see how, for example, a cancer has spread.",
      "Dr Kulshrestha showed me pictures taken from an anonymous patient, where doctors suspected cancer had spread from his prostate to his bones.",
      "Sadly for the person involved, the images are stark. Areas on the bones are lit up orange, where the cancer has grown on their bones.",
      "\"These radioisotopes form a vital part of the diagnostic process\", Dr Kulshrestha told me.",
      "\"We couldn't work without them these days.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 14:13:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Households should consider a fixed tariff, Ofgem says, as it announces another rise in the energy price cap.",
    "story": [
      "Households are being encouraged to consider a fixed price deal on their energy bills by the regulator ahead of costs rising again in April.",
      "Ofgem is increasing the energy price cap by 6.4%, meaning a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will see their bill rise by \u00a3111 a year, or \u00a39.25 a month, to \u00a31,849.",
      "The cap, which is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Ofgem said switching to a fixed tariff provided certainty over payments and could reduce costs, although analysts predict prices could fall in July.",
      "The seven bills due to go up in April",
      "The rise in April will hit people's finances at the same time as water and council tax increases, although average wages are also going up.",
      "The regulator said rising wholesale costs and inflation were behind the latest energy price hike - the third consecutive increase in the quarterly cap and more than the 5% analysts had forecast.",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not, so bills will vary depending on how much energy is used.",
      "Ofgem illustrates the cap by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity. Some customers in London and the North Wales and Mersey region will see an overall increase of up to \u00a320 a year.",
      "Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley accepted another increase in energy costs was \"unwelcome\".",
      "He said customers, where possible, should consider \"switching or fixing tariffs now\" to try to lower costs and \"provide certainty over coming payments\".",
      "According to Ofgem, about four million households have fixed in recent months.",
      "Some people in debt to their supplier will not be able to switch firms, but should still be able to fix with their current provider on their best fixed deal.",
      "Anyone worried about paying their bills should contact their supplier for help, Mr Brearley added.",
      "Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, told the BBC that moving to a fixed deal was a \"no-brainer\".",
      "He said people should check whole-of-market comparison sites for the best deal, and wait a little while before choosing a new tariff as he has heard some \"good tariffs are being launched\" by energy firms.",
      "However, analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight have forecast variable prices could fall again in July to close to the current level.",
      "At a mum and baby sensory class in Manchester, parents said rising bills were a constant worry.",
      "\"We have definitely felt a difference in the quality of life we can afford now,\" said Michelle Gill, who attended the session with her baby, Ori.",

      "Charities said the price increase would be a painful blow for billpayers.",
      "Citizens Advice said its research suggested 6.7 million people in England, Wales and Scotland were in debt to their energy supplier. Official figures show nearly \u00a34bn is owed.",
      "\"We're helping people every day who simply can't afford this latest price hike,\" said its chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty.",
      "The government has announced it is planning to extend the number of people who qualify for the Warm Home Discount scheme next winter - which gives some people on benefits a reduction of \u00a3150 from their annual energy bill.",
      "Energy bills are about 50% higher than pre-Covid levels, but remain below the peak reached in 2022 when Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused prices to spike.",
      "Ofgem director general of markets, Tim Jarvis, said the latest price rises were driven by international gas prices, which have gone up \"significantly\" recently.",
      "However, analysts at Cornwall Insight said energy prices have dipped in the past couple of weeks following US-Russia talks on a potential end to the Ukraine war.",
      "As a result, the consultancy has forecast the price cap in July will fall to \u00a31,756 a year for a typical consumer, although it noted this would still be hundreds of pounds above the pre-conflict level.",

      "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.",
      "We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.",

      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He founded the company back in 2013 with business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",

      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",

      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:40:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",
      "\"With cryptography,\" says Mr Dupressoir \"If somebody breaks your system, you will only know once they've got your data.\"",

      "Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious \"transparency on foreign influence bill\", often dubbed the \"foreign agents law\".",
      "Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as \"organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power\", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country.",
      "Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold.",
      "Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police.",
      "In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year.",
      "There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili.",
      "The motion expressed \"deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters\".",
      "TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands.",

      "The US sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili call for his assets to be frozen, and place restrictions on US citizens and companies from doing business personally with him, but they do not affect his companies or family members.",
      "For more than a decade Mr Ivanishvili has been involved in legal battles with another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, over fraud and mismanagement of his money.",

    "title": "First 750 schools named for free breakfast clubs",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 19:17:52 GMT",
    "summary": "From April, a pilot scheme will offer free breakfasts for 180,000 pupils before class.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced the first 750 schools to provide free daily breakfast clubs as part of a pilot scheme ahead of a planned England-wide rollout.",
      "Starting in April, 180,000 pupils in England will be offered \"healthy, varied and nutritious breakfasts\" in schools before class, Labour said - with over a third of schools in the pilot scheme in deprived areas.",
      "But some MPs and head teachers' unions have raised concerns the funding is too low.",
      "Labour campaigned on a promise of free breakfast clubs in every English primary school and later tripled funding to \u00a330m.",
      "Cautious welcome for free school breakfast clubs",
      "Free school meals 'would tackle child poverty'",
      "Parents will be able to drop off children 30 minutes before their usual school time, knowing they will be offered a free breakfast, the government says.",
      "Shadow Education Minister Neil O'Brien told the House of Commons there were \"a number of questions\" about the plans, including \"the difference in the planned spend and the much larger benefits ministers are claiming\".",
      "Analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the funding proposed for the breakfast clubs could be enough to fund all primary school pupils under a food-only model, or 60% of pupils if it had some childcare element.",
      "O'Brien questioned how the education secretary was planning to close that funding gap.",
      "But Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the House of Commons she was \"confident\" the funding would be adequate.",
      "One in seven schools involved in the pilot had no before-school provision already in place, Phillipson said, and the rest either have paid-for provision or have their numbers capped.",
      "\"These breakfast clubs that we are introducing will be free to every child and every parent who seeks to take them up,\" she said.",
      "Phillipson did not confirm when the national rollout of the scheme would take place, but said it would be \"as soon as possible\".",
      "'Really worried'",
      "The Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio  said head teachers were \"really worried\"  the basic daily rate of just 60p per pupil was far too low.",
      "\"We strongly urge the government to be more realistic about the costs involved, before it attempts to roll out this policy nationally,\" he said.",
      "The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has welcomed the news but also voiced concern that funding could fall short.",
      "\"It will be crucial that these concerns are addressed before the programme is rolled out across the country, to ensure that it does not place further pressure on already strained school budgets,\" said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman.",
      "Announcing the first 750 schools to join the pilot scheme, the Department for Education said breakfast clubs had \"an important role to play in the government's commitment to remove the stain of child poverty\".",
      "Devon tops the list with 25 schools in the programme, followed by England's largest local authority, Birmingham, with 24.",
      "Both Wales and Scotland have programmes to provide free breakfasts to children in primary schools.",
      "Guidance sent to schools taking part in the pilot scheme says they will receive a set-up payment to cover equipment and material.",
      "Under the scheme, schools will then be reimbursed by the government based on attendance at the clubs - a school with 50% participation in the pilot scheme could get \u00a323,000 a year, the government said.",

      "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not.",
      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for best actor, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",
      "\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 musicians - including Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn and Kate Bush - released a silent album on Tuesday in protest at the UK government's planned changes to copyright law, which they say would make it easier for AI companies to train models using copyrighted work without a licence.",
      "Under the new proposals, AI developers will be able to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders elect to \"opt out\".",
      "The artists hope the album, entitled Is This What We Want?, will draw attention to the potential impact on livelihoods and the UK music industry.",
      "All profits will be donated to the charity Help Musicians.",
      "\"In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard?\" Kate Bush said in a statement.",
      "A public consultation on the legal changes closes later on Tuesday.",
      "The album - also backed by the likes of Billy Ocean, Ed O'Brien of Radiohead and Bastille's Dan Smith, as well as The Clash, Mystery Jets and Jamiroquai - features sound recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, demonstrating what the artists fear is the potential impact of the proposed law change.",
      "The tracklisting for the record simply spells out the message: \"The British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies.\"",
      "The government is currently consulting on proposals that would allow AI companies to use material that is available online without respecting copyright if they are using it for text or data mining.",
      "Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human.",
      "The proposals would give artists or creators a so-called \"rights reservation\" \u2013 the ability to opt out.",
      "But critics of the plan believe it is not possible for an individual writer or artist to notify thousands of different AI service providers that they do not want their content used in that way, or to monitor what has happened to their work across the whole internet.",
      "A spokesman for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said in a statement on Tuesday that the UK's \"current regime for copyright and AI is holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential - and that cannot continue\".",
      "\"That's why we have been consulting on a new approach that protects the interests of both AI developers and right holders and delivers a solution which allows both to thrive.",
      "\"We have engaged extensively with these sectors throughout and will continue to do so.\"",
      "They added that \"no decisions have been taken\" and \"no moves will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives.\"",
      "'Disastrous for musicians'",
      "Imogen Heap, Yusuf aka Cat Stevens and Riz Ahmed have also backed the silent album release as well as Tori Amos and Hans Zimmer.",
      "Composer Max Richter, another of the artists involved in the album, noted how the plans not only have an impact on musicians but \"impoverish creators\" across the board, from writers to visual artists and beyond.",
      "In 2023, UK music contributed a record \u00a37.6 billion to the economy.",
      "Organiser of the silent record, Ed Newton-Rex, said the proposals were not only \"disastrous for musicians\" in the UK but also \"totally unnecessary\", as the country can be \"leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus\".",
      "He said the new record showed that \"however the government tries to justify it, musicians themselves are united in their thorough condemnation of this ill-thought-through plan.\"",
      "Singer-songwriter Naomi Kimpenu added: \"We cannot be abandoned by the government and have our work stolen for the profit of big tech.\"",
      "She said the plans would \"shatter the prospects of so many emerging artists in the UK\".",
      "In January, Sir Paul McCartney told the BBC the proposed changes to copyright law could allow \"rip off\" technology that might make it impossible for musicians and artists to make a living.",
      "In a letter to The Times, published on Monday, signatories including Sir Paul, Lord Lloyd Webber and Sir Stephen Fry said that changes to the law will allow big tech to raid the creative sectors.",
      "They were joined by the likes of Bush, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa and Sting in opposing plans to change copyright laws.",

      "The Traitors contestant Elen Wyn has said she was laughed at by a GP and told she had a low pain threshold during her 10-year wait for an endometriosis diagnosis.",
      "Elen, from Anglesey, said she suffered with pain that felt like \"barbed wire around her stomach\" before her diagnosis, which she was told was \"just period pains\".",
      "She added GPs needed to treat women's health with greater sensitivity and called for better funding from the Welsh government.",

      "Endometriosis cost me my job",
      "The Traitors star, originally from Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy in Anglesey - who was eliminated on episode two - said she was diagnosed just before appearing on the reality show in 2024 - 10 years after her symptoms started.",
      "Elen, now 24, said when her periods began at 14, she frequently missed school and sat out of sport, but a GP insisted she just had a low pain tolerance.",
      "She said she was offered a contraceptive pill, which is one of the treatment options available, if she was really struggling, but she did not feel comfortable with this option while not sexually active.",
      "She said she continued to suffer so badly she was unable to walk or leave the house.",
      "\"Sometimes it's like you're being repeatedly stabbed,\" she said.",

      "\"I saw another GP but he said the same, that my pain tolerance was too low.",
      "\"I remember him laughing at me, it was awful,\" she said.",

      "But when both an ultrasound and an MRI scan came back clear of the condition, Elen pushed for a laparoscopy, and it was only then that her stage four endometriosis was detected.",
      "The disease had spread across Elen's bowel, bladder, fallopian tubes and kidney and, while she is currently on a four-year waiting list for surgery, she has been using her TikTok account to raise awareness about the condition.",
      "What is endometriosis?",
      "Endometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation where tissue similar to the lining of the womb is found in other areas of the body, including the fallopian tubes, pelvis, bowel, vagina and intestines.",
      "In rare cases it has even been found in the lungs, eyes, spine and brain. It was once thought that the only place in the body where endometriosis did not occur was the spleen, but in 2020 it was found there also.",
      "Symptoms include severe to debilitating pain often in the pelvic area, fatigue, and heavy periods, and the condition is also associated with infertility.",
      "Research by charity Endometriosis UK found the average diagnosis time for endometriosis in Wales was nine years and 11 months in 2024.",
      "This was the longest diagnosis time across the UK and had increased from nine years in 2020.",
      "Elen said she was given no support from her GP while she awaited her diagnosis, adding: \"I have been offered the coil or the pill, [but] other than that I was given nothing which is so frustrating.\"",
      "She said through her own research she had made changes to her lifestyle to manage her condition, including cutting down her alcohol and caffeine intake as well as engaging in low-impact exercise and prioritising sleep.",
      "\"I don't suffer nearly as much as I used to... [but] I have done that all on my own,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"I think a narrative needs to be erased here. Because it's a condition associated with female hormones, people tend to link the symptoms with being dramatic and it's really frustrating to me.",
      "\"There is so much stigma around it and I think that stigma needs to be deleted.\"",
      "Elen has called on the Welsh government to offer more funding, better information and greater sensitivity to women's health.",
      "\"I think GPs need to spend more time exploring symptoms and offering other solutions rather than just the pill or the coil, it's ridiculous,\" she said.",
      "The Welsh government said endometriosis was one of the eight priorities outlined  in its Women's Health Plan for Wales.",
      "\"We have already funded endometriosis nurses in every health board, developed the Endometriosis Cymru website and provided \u00a350 million of additional funding to help cut the longest waiting times, which includes gynaecological conditions,\" it said.",

      "Born in North Carolina and raised in Arlington, Virginia, the musician started out as a classical pianist. She gained a full school scholarship to Howard University aged just 15. Her classical training led her into teaching, but at night she'd accompany opera singers on piano, singing pop standards during the breaks.",
      "\"The whole while I was studying classical music, especially in my younger years, I was also doing a lot of doo-ron-ron, shoo-doo-bee-doo, all of that stuff, with my peers, so I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by music all of my life, the Bach and the Chopin and the Schumann on one hand, and all the rhythm and blues,\" she explained.",
      "Her recording career started after she was discovered singing in a jazz club by musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known\".",
      "But she didn't score her first hit until she was in her 30s - when her recording of Ewan MacColl's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face was used to soundtrack an explicit love scene in Clint Eastwood's 1971 film Play Misty For Me.",
      "It was subsequently named song of the year at the Grammys. Flack won the award a second time the following year, for Killing Me Softly With His Song.",
      "After topping the charts again in 1974 with Feel Like Makin' Love, Flack took a break from performing to concentrate on recording and charitable causes.",
      "She spent much of the 1980s touring and over the course of her career, worked with artists including Donny Hathaway and Miles Davis.",
      "In 1991 she returned to the charts with a duet with Maxi Priest called Set the Night to Music (from the album of the same name).",
      "She also recorded an album of Beatles covers, called Let It Be Roberta, in 2012.",
      "'True soul'",

      "\"I've tried my entire career to tell stories through my music. This award is a validation to me that my peers heard my thoughts and took in what I have tried to give.\"",
      "Flack's most famous song was introduced to a new generation of music fans when Lauryn Hill's hip-hop group The Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of Killing Me Softly, which they would eventually perform on-stage alongside her.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:06:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Her departure comes less than a month after two House of Commons committees discussed her suitability to lead the NHS.",
    "story": [
      "Amanda Pritchard, the first female chief executive of the NHS in England, is stepping down from the role.",
      "In a statement Ms Pritchard said it had been a \"hugely difficult decision for me to stand down\".",
      "\"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.\"",
      "She took up the post in 2021 and played a central role in the official response to the Covid pandemic.",
      "Before that, she was NHS England's chief operating officer, head of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust in London and an adviser in Tony Blair's government.",
      "Her departure comes less than a month after two influential House of Commons committees discussed her suitability to lead the NHS through a period of what Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said will be the biggest overhaul of the service.",
      "As to the timing of her resignation, some words in her letter are significant.",
      "She noted that there is due to be radical reform of the size and functions of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to \"drive the government's reform priorities\" and that the \"step change required\" would be best served by new leadership.",
      "Sources have indicated that the government wants to bind NHS England closer to the Department of Health to push ahead with changes, including shifting the focus from hospitals to community care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting may well have felt the need to find a new leader, and Amanda Pritchard possibly felt that after several years at NHS England she did not want to be on a tighter rein.",
      "Amanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government.",
      "\"Wes Streeting is entitled to shape things as he wishes\", said one, \"but the role of NHS England chief executive will change\".",
      "A government source indicated NHS England would in due course be a smaller organisation as some powers were devolved to regional health boards.",
      "The reality is that whoever is appointed, the government faces huge challenges cutting waiting lists for operations and treatments, and reducing long waits in emergency departments.",
      "'Turbulent waters'",
      "NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.",
      "Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.",
      "He said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"",
      "Richard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.",
      "\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.",
      "Ms Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "The public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.",
      "MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.",
      "Last week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"",
      "NHS England has announced that Sir James Mackey, currently chief executive of Newcastle Hospitals, will be taking over as interim head of NHS England and will work closely with Ms Pritchard for the next month before taking up post formally in April.",
      "Her successor, Sir James, said he was honoured to be leading the health service through the next phase \"as we radically reshape the role of NHS England and work with the government to build an NHS that is fit for the future through the 10-year health plan\".",
      "Sir James, a highly experienced NHS trust boss, will be known as transition chief executive with no time limit set on how long he will serve. It's understood that no appointment process has been set up to look for a replacement for Ms Pritchard."

      "An artificial-intelligence tool can detect two-thirds of epilepsy brain lesions doctors often miss, say the UK researchers who have developed it, paving the way for more targeted surgery to stop seizures.",
      "One out of every five people with epilepsy - a total of 30,000 in the UK - has uncontrolled seizures caused by brain abnormalities too subtle for the human eye to see on scans.",
      "Child epilepsy experts say the AI tool has \"huge potential\" and opens up avenues for treatment.",
      "But more studies on the long-term benefits for patients are needed before it can be licensed and used in clinics.",
      "Brain abnormalities called focal cortical dysplasia are a common cause of epilepsy, especially when medication cannot control seizures.",

      "Removing a small part of the brain can be a safe and effective way of stopping them - but if radiologists cannot see the tiny lesions on brain scans, diagnosis, treatment and surgery can be delayed.",
      "'Really difficult'",
      "For this study, published in JAMA Neurology, the researchers, from King's College London and University College London, fed their tool magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) scans from more than 1,185 adults and children at 23 hospitals around the world, 703 of whom had brain abnormalities.",
      "The tool, MELD Graph, was able to process the images more quickly than a doctor could - and in more detail - which could mean more timely treatment and fewer  costly tests and procedures, lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl said.",
      "The AI would require human oversight, however, and many of the abnormalities were still missed.",
      "\"It's like finding one character on five pages of solid black text,\"  Dr Wagstyl said.",
      "\"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find.\"",
      "At one hospital in Italy, the tool identified a subtle lesion missed by radiologists, in a 12-year-old boy who had tried nine different medications but still had seizures every day.",
      "Study co-author and childhood epilepsy consultant Prof Helen Cross said it had the potential \"to rapidly identify abnormalities that can be removed and potentially cure the epilepsy\".",
      "Uncontrolled epilepsy was \"incapacitating\", she said.",
      "Many of the children she sees as a consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital have had years of seizures and investigations before a lesion is found.",
      "Charity Epilepsy Action said the new AI tool's potential was \"really exciting\" and could give people faster diagnosis, but did not solve the issue of lack of specialist epilepsy nurses in England.",
      "\"It remains early days and, as always, we must proceed with caution,\" said Ley Sander from the Epilepsy Society, adding that if the tool could identify more people as candidates for brain surgery, that could be \"life-changing for many more people with epilepsy\".",
      "The researchers are hoping for official approval to use MELD Graph as a diagnostic tool - but other trials are needed first to investigate the long-term benefits for patients whose brain lesions are detected.",

      "\"That could have been me that was attacked - Rudi didn't know what he was doing,\" Delvin said.",
      "\"He was just very delusional, because he believed whatever was going on in his head. No matter what you said to him about reality, it had no effect.",
      "\"By that point the services were saying 'well, he's an adult, he needs to come in himself', [but] at that point it's too late, they've missed the opportunity.\"",

      "The rare genetic condition means the babies' vision deteriorated very rapidly from birth.",
      "Before the therapy, they were registered legally blind and only just able to distinguish between dark and light. After the infusion, all parents reported improvements - with some of their young children now able to begin to draw and write.",

      "Gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness has been available on the NHS since 2020.",
      "The new work builds on that success by injecting healthy copies of a defective gene into the back of a child's eye, very early in life, to treat a severe form of the condition.",
      "Jace, from Connecticut in the United States, had the gene therapy in London when he was just two years old.",
      "As a young baby, his parents noticed something wasn't right about his eyesight.",
      "\"Around eight weeks old when babies should start looking at you and smiling, Jace wasn't doing that yet,\" says his mum DJ.",
      "She knew instinctively there was an issue and began to search for the reason, which took 10 months.",
      "After several visits to doctors and many tests, the family were told Jace had the ultra rare condition. It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.",
      "\"It was a shock,\" Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child.",
      "\"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward.\"",

      "Scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye, and Great Ormond Street Hospital specialists led on giving the procedure in the trial.",
      "Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available.",
      "Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects.",
      "They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors.",
      "Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging.",
      "'Hugely impressive'",

      "\"To help stop the spread of Norovirus, it is important to remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water and avoid mixing with other people until you have not had symptoms for two days.\"",
      "Most healthy people recover from Norovirus in a few days, but it can cause serious problems in vulnerable people and young children.",
      "One problem is that it spreads very easily - with just a few viral particles needed to infect someone - for example through close contact with someone who has the virus, or by eating food prepared by someone with it.",

      "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",
      "\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"",
      "He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",
      "\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.",
      "In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.",
      "And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.",
      "An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.",
      "The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.",
      "And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",
      "Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.",

      "Hooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choice",
      "Ketamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'",
      "But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.",
      "'It's in the schools, it's in the parks'",
      "One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",
      "The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.",
      "Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"",
      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

    "summary": "The prime minister has set out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer's promise to increase defence spending will have several consequences.  It may one day actually strengthen the UK's ability to defend itself. More immediately it will mean billions less spent on foreign aid.",
      "But what will it buy the prime minister diplomatically in Washington?",
      "In times past visiting dignitaries would give emperors gifts and tributes. Starmer  will now turn up at the White House on Thursday with a large goodie bag marked \"more defence spending\".",
      "Donald Trump is just the latest in a long line of US presidents urging European powers to spend more on their own defence.",
      "The prime minister will be able to say to the president that he has heard the call and acted. He might not want Trump to ask too many detailed questions: What does an added 0.2% of GDP mean in real money? When will the UK actually spend 3% on defence?",
      "But Starmer will want to land the idea that the UK is responding to Trump's agenda.",
      "Early signs are positive. Peter Hegseth, the US Secretary of Defence, said he had spoken to his UK counterpart, John Healey, and described the increase as \"a strong step from an enduring partner\".",
      "So Starmer's announcement may well get his foot in the door at the White House and a hearing from the president.",
      "But will it help him make the case for the security of Ukraine and Europe? Will Trump now be more amenable to allowing both a seat at the negotiating table? Will Trump be more open to the idea that the United States should play a role guaranteeing post-war Ukraine's security, giving air, logistics and intelligence cover to European forces helping to keep the peace on the ground?",
      "The answer to those questions is not clear cut. The prime minister may suggest the UK is showing leadership, pointing the way for other European allies to follow suit.",
      "He may also argue that the defence hike shows the UK will not have to make what he calls the \"historic mistake\" of having to choose between Europe and the US, something made much harder by the US decision to vote with Russia against Ukraine and Europe at the United Nations on Monday.",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund hike in defence spending",
      "How much do Nato members spend on defence?",
      "The problem is that Trump and his administration have made it clear that their security priority is China and Europe will just have to do more to look after itself.",
      "Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC: \"The reality is that whatever we do on defence, the US is going to pivot elsewhere, it is not going to take the lead role in European security that it has done for more than half a century.\"",
      "In that context, the government's promised increase in defence spending may be seen as a short-term tactical move ahead of Starmer's visit to Washington, rather than an historic response to the existential geopolitical changes posed by Trump's election.",
      "European diplomats told me they were underwhelmed by the UK defence offer, saying it was not enough to have a real impact. They said the UK would have to spend at least 3% of national wealth soon to give itself a chance to develop the capability it would need.",
      "To do that, the government would have to do more than raid the development budget. Aid charities noted that their spending was a soft target compared to those of massive spending departments such as welfare, health and education.",
      "But few politicians of any political colour appear prepared to start making an argument for a transformation of the post-war European welfare model and prepare voters for a massive change in defence spending.",
      "For now, the government is cutting foreign aid and international charities are furious.",
      "The reduction from 0.5% of national income to 0.3% means \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. Given that billions of this budget still pays for asylum seekers' hotels here in the UK, the actual amount spent on aid overseas will be about 0.15%.",
      "The prime minister said the UK would use this remaining aid money to help Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza, tackle climate change, and support multinational efforts on global health.",
      "Aid charities were stunned. Save the Children said it was betrayal of the world's most vulnerable children. The One campaign said it would create huge problems for the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance. The aid network BOND said there would be devastating consequences for millions of marginalised people.",
      "All this after Donald Trump froze America's development spending arm, USAID.",
      "By cutting foreign aid, the government has broken a manifesto commitment to protect the budget. It has also damaged its policy of using aid to engage more closely with countries in the global south.",
      "David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee and former Labour foreign secretary, said the cut was \"a blow to Britain's proud reputation as a global humanitarian and development leader\".",

    "summary": "The PM will head to Washington a day after announcing military budgets would rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer is preparing to travel to Washington to meet Donald Trump after setting out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "On Tuesday, the prime minister said he would cut the foreign aid budget to fund the military boost - a move welcomed by the Trump administration but labelled a \"betrayal\" by development charities.",
      "Sir Keir will face MPs in the Commons on Wednesday before flying to the US, where Ukraine will be top of the agenda.",
      "The spending announcement came as leaders across Europe looked to overhaul defence policies over fears the US could make a deal with Russia to end the Ukraine war which leaves the continent vulnerable.",
      "Trump - who has long called for European members of the Nato military alliance to spend more on defence - is attempting to cut a rapid deal to bring the Ukraine war to an end after speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "He has been a staunch critic of the previous US administration's military support for Kyiv and wants Europe to play a bigger role in any future security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "On Tuesday, Ukrainian officials confirmed to BBC News a deal had been reached which gives American firms access to the country's vast deposits of valuable rare earth minerals, which Trump signalled could mean continued US military support for Kyiv until a ceasefire with Russia is reached.",
      "Announcing the defence spending plan, Sir Keir said the UK's aid budget would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027, \"fully funding the investment in defence\", which will rise from 2.3% of GDP.",
      "He told the Commons that would mean spending \u00a313.4bn more on defence every year from 2027.",
      "Last year the UK spent \u00a353.9bn on defence.",
      "The prime minister said defence spending would rise to 2.6% of GDP by 2027, once the contribution of intelligence services to defence had been factored in.",
      "The move was praised by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who called it a \"strong step from an enduring partner\".",
      "Starmer upends Labour manifesto to confront Europe's new reality",
      "Urging European allies to step up, Sir Keir said the UK would also set out a \"clear ambition\" to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP after the next general election.",
      "Holding a news conference following the announcement, Sir Keir said an election  pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP had been brought forward \"in light of the grave threats that we face\", with the country facing a \"dangerous new era\".",
      "Asked if pressure from Trump had pushed him to act, Sir Keir insisted it was \"very much my decision, based on my assessment of the circumstances that we face as a country\".",
      "But he conceded \"the last few weeks have accelerated my thinking\".",
      "\"I think in our heart of hearts we've all known that this decision has been coming for three years, since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine,\" the prime minister added.",
      "In its election manifesto, Labour pledged to restore development spending to 0.7% of gross national income \"as soon as fiscal circumstances allow\" - a goal the government says it is still committed to.",
      "Charities were stunned by the aid cut, with Save the Children calling it \"a betrayal of the world's most vulnerable children and the UK's national interest\".",
      "\"There is nothing respectful about slashing lifelines for families in the most dangerous places,\" the charity's chief executive Moazzam Malik said.",
      "Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the Commons International Development Committee, called on the government to \"rethink today's announcement\".",
      "\"Cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that will only make the world less safe,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the criticism, Sir Keir said it was \"not a decision I wanted to make\" but he argued there was \"no driver of migration and poverty like conflict\".",
      "The hike in defence spending will help the UK's armed forces, which have experienced severe cuts since the end of the Cold War.",
      "However, it will not completely reverse the decline in the country's military capability.",
      "Even before this extra cash injection, the Ministry of Defence was facing a black hole in its equipment budget of around \u00a317bn over the next decade, according to the National Audit Office.",
      "A large part of the increase will go towards plugging holes in underfunded programs and fixing urgent shortages in munitions, according to Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute think tank.",
      "But he said the commitment to reach 3% of GDP by the mid-2030s could lead to a \"transformation in how our military fights\", giving the armed forces the ability to plan long-term and \"ensuring that innovation is not always squeezed out by spending on big platforms\".",
      "Dr Simon Anglim, a fellow at the Department of War Studies at King's College London, said spending 3% of GDP on defence by 2030 is \"the barest minimum\" to build a military strong enough to deter Russia.",
      "If the US were to withdraw military support \"we may have to start talking about more than that\", he told the BBC.",
      "Sir Keir had previously said the government would set out a pathway to spending 2.5% of GDP on the military by the next general election, following a review of the country's defence capabilities.",
      "But rapid diplomatic developments, spurred by Trump's push to end the war in Ukraine, injected urgency into decisions about defence.",
      "It is unclear if the increase will impress Trump, who has been telling European Nato allies they should be spending something more like 5% on defence.",
      "Nato guidelines suggest each member state should spend at least 2% of their GDP, but recently the organisation's head, Mark Rutte, said allies should be aiming for something \"north of 3%\".",
      "The prime minister's trip to the White House later this week follows French President Emmanuel Macron's talks with Trump on Monday.",
      "Sir Keir will also host European leaders in the UK this weekend to discuss their future defence.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the increase in defence spending and the \"repurposing\" of money from the aid budget.",
      "But she did question whether the government had a strong enough economic strategy to underpin the rise in spending on defence.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have previously called for cross-party talks on reaching 3% of GDP on defence \"as soon as possible\".",
      "Party leader Sir Ed Davey welcomed the announcement but urged the government to \"raise the money in different ways\" through seizing frozen Russian assets or by increasing taxes on multi-national tech companies.",
      "The SNP's Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, said that whilst his party backed the increase in defence spending, it could not support \"the populist playbook\" of cutting aid to fund it.",

    "summary": "The Crime and Policing Bill will give officers powers to make Britain's cities safer, the home secretary says.",
    "story": [
      "Police will be given new powers to search homes without a warrant for stolen mobile phones under major legislation which targets theft, street crime and anti-social behaviour.",
      "The Crime and Policing Bill is at the heart of what the government calls its \"Safer Streets mission\" and ministers want it to become law by the end of the year.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC the bill would address an \"epidemic of street theft\", including a rise in phone and bag snatching and shoplifting, and introduce new \"Respect Orders\" with restrictions similar to Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (Asbos).",
      "The Conservatives say the plans have been \"copied and pasted from the last government's announcements\".",
      "Child exploitation and cuckooing to be criminal offences",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his pledges?",
      "The bill, unveiled in Parliament on Tuesday, pulls together many measures set out in Labour's general election manifesto.",
      "But they come amid questions over whether police have the funding to make the government's plan work.",
      "Under the bill, police would gain the power to enter and search a property without a court warrant for a stolen mobile phone or other items that have been electronically tracked, such as laptops or Bluetooth-tagged bikes.",
      "The power would mean that victims of mobile phone thefts who track their device while it is in the hands of a criminal could call on police to recover it quickly.",
      "Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she understood the \"incredible frustration\" of phone theft victims who say \"I can track it, I can see where it is - it's in this particular house, it's in this particular location\".",
      "\"And yet the police can't act fast enough to be able to track it down,\" she added.",
      "Cooper said \"we have to have the stronger powers and action [and] the police say they welcome this\".",
      "Asked about the reliability of locator apps, where people can use another device to help track down the location of their missing or stolen phone, being used in police searches, Cooper told BBC Breakfast: \"Police will have to make decisions [and] it will need to be signed off by a police inspector, and [they will] need to make decisions about where the evidence is good enough for them to be able to act.\"",
      "She added that the bill would include scrapping a \"ludicrous\" \u00a3200 threshold for shoplifting, which meant lower value thefts were not currently prioritised by police.",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins told Sky News she was \"deeply concerned\" that no longer treating shoplifting below \u00a3200 as a summary-only offence would have significant long-term effects on crown courts, saying \"victims of rape will find it even harder and longer to get their day in court\".",
      "But Cooper said addressing lower value thefts which were not likely to lead to prison would stop criminal behaviour escalating to the stage where such sentences would apply.",
      "The bill also includes the government's proposed \"Respect Orders\" - court-imposed restrictions that will be similar to the Asbo developed in the Tony Blair era, then scrapped by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats coalition a decade ago.",
      "While Asbos were popular with voters, critics say the restrictions often became unworkable or poorly enforced.",

      "An offence of assaulting a shop worker - also a Conservative commitment before the 2024 General Election.A new police power to seize without warning off-road bikes or e-scooters.A new offence of spiking drinks, separate to current assault laws.Giving judges the power to issue a Stalking Prevention Order against a suspect, even if they are not convicted of a crime.",

      "Another already announced power to be added as the bill goes through Parliament will compel online retailers to alert police to bulk or suspicious sales of knives.",
      "Restaurant and retail bosses have written to Cooper to warn the bill \"stops short\" of protecting delivery riders under the plans. They want the new offence of threatening or assaulting a shop worker in their place of work to include couriers on journeys to and from customers.",
      "Cooper refused to be drawn on whether introducing new criminal offences would add unwelcome extra pressure on police, prisons, and the court system.",
      "Several police forces across England and Wales have previously warned they will have to make cuts to existing officers this year despite receiving extra funding, and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in December that prisons were at risk of running out of space.",
      "Cooper told the Today programme that a boost in police spending and increasing \"early prevention action\" would help prevent crimes escalating and prison sentences needing to be imposed, while community measures like tagging and curfews would also be strengthened.",
      "The Home Office says the bill's aims will be delivered by recruiting 13,000 additional neighbourhood officers by 2029 - and the department has pledged \u00a3200m specifically towards that.",
      "The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC ) said last year that forces faced a \u00a31.3bn funding gap, and the available cash was not being shared evenly between forces due to outdated rules.",
      "The Home Office has since confirmed it is putting \u00a31.1bn extra into policing up to April 2026.",
      "But the NPCC has warned that if it is to deliver the \"Safer Streets\" plan, forces would need a pay settlement that would help them to attract and retain the best possible officers.",
      "Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: \"Labour had 14 years to come up with new ideas \u2013 but all they have done is copied and pasted what the last government had already announced.",
      "\"Labour's funding settlement next year for police forces leaves them \u00a3118m short after accounting for salary rises, inflation and the national insurance hike \u2013 putting 1,800 police officers at risk.",

      "\"What I have not agreed with is deciding we should leave without having a plan for what that looks like and how to do so in a way that makes sense.\"",
      "Setting out how rules were critical for a trading nation like the UK, she added: \"But other countries are breaking the rules and we need to get serious about that and not pretend that those things aren't happening and that's really what I want us to focus on.\"",

    "summary": "The environment secretary is met with blaring tractor horns as he tries to win over farmers.",
    "story": [
      "Farmers protesting at government changes to agricultural inheritance tax rules have briefly disrupted a minister's speech at a national conference.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed was met with horns from tractors parked outside and protesters who silently unfurled banners in front of him as he outlined farming reforms, which included plans to focus on food production and make the industry more resilient to disruption.",
      "Reed told the hundreds gathered at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference that he could not give them \"the answer many of you want on inheritance tax\" but he understood the strength of feeling in the room.",
      "NFU president Tom Bradshaw told the annual conference on Tuesday the inheritance tax changes were \"morally wrong and economically flawed\".",
      "Under the government's planned changes, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",
      "The government has previously said that the changes will only impact the wealthiest 500 farms each year, a number disputed by farmers unions which estimate up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "Mr Bradshaw, whose speech was also briefly interrupted by two protesters who appeared to be urging people to be vegan, said the government had broken promises made before the election and had increased the mental health pressures on farmers, calling for it to correct the tax policy \"urgently'.",
      "\"We will fight this family farm tax until ministers do the right thing,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, this government needs a reset moment with farming, where they face up to the reality of how much the industry is struggling.\"",
      "Many farmers argue that while they are asset rich, for example in terms of their land or livestock, they are cash poor and the proposed changes would mean they would have to sell up in order to pay the tax.",
      "What is inheritance tax, who pays it and what's changing for farmers?",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "In his speech, Reed had also outlined plans for a 25-year farming roadmap and food strategy, which would put food production at its core and make farm businesses more resilient to challenges such as severe flooding, drought and animal disease.",
      "He said it would ensure farming is a \"sector which recognises restoring nature is not in competition with sustainable food production, but is essential to it\".",
      "As farmers outside the conference centre sounded their tractor horns, he announced measures including extending the seasonal worker visa scheme for five years, support for precision breeding and new technology.",
      "He also announced new requirements for government catering contracts to favour \"high quality, high welfare products that British producers are well placed to meet\".",
      "Earlier in the day, a multi-generational farming family - Martin Towler, his daughter and son-in-law, Hazel and Tom Church, and their five-year-old son Bertie - went to the Treasury to handover a collection of pre-loved farming toys donated by farmers who might be hit by the government's proposed changes to agricultural inheritance tax.",
      "The family have been farming Scald End Farm, a mixed beef and sheep farm in north Bedfordshire, since the 1940s but they all now also have to work off farm to supplement their income.",
      "They say the impact of the proposed inheritance tax changes will leave them facing a \u00a3400,000 bill and the prospect of selling off so much of the 210-acre farm that it would become unviable as a business.",
      "Mr Church said he hoped the government would listen to farmers' concerns and try to find a compromise on its inheritance tax policy.",
      "He told the BBC the changes, as currently proposed, would have a \"detrimental\" impact on the family's ability to run a profitable business.",
      "\"We are struggling at the moment as it is. There's no two ways about that,\" he said.",
      "\"Farming is incredibly low return on investment when you look at the asset values of the land and the income generated.",
      "\"If we are saddled with further debt through death - is it viable? Selling land is going to make it even less viable.\"",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins has said the Conservatives would reverse the inheritance tax on farmers \"straight away\".",
      "During Tuesday's conference in Westminster - the first time it has been held outside Birmingham for years - Reed, took questions from the audience.",
      "There was clear anger among those questioning him on the tax changes and he was told many older farmers \"were wishing their lives away\" and now felt they would benefit their families by dying before the 2026 tax change.",

      "Amanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government.",

      "NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.",
      "Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.",
      "He said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"",
      "Richard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.",
      "\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.",
      "Ms Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "The public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.",
      "MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.",
      "Last week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has \"changed the global conversation\" on Ukraine, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said, three years on from Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "Sir Keir suggested Trump had \"created an opportunity\" to end the war, in a speech to an international summit on supporting Ukraine in Kyiv.",
      "The prime minister also appeared to contradict President Trump by saying \"Russia does not hold all the cards in this war\".",
      "Sir Keir said the West \"must increase the pressure even further\" on Russia and announced the UK would impose a new round of sanctions on the country.",
      "The prime minister said more sanctions could push President Vladimir Putin \"to a point where he is ready not just to talk, but to make concessions\".",
      "On Monday the UK government said it had imposed more than 100 new sanctions on those who continued to aid the invasion, including companies in China, which is the largest supplier of critical goods for Russia's military.",
      "Meanwhile, the Home Office has announced a move to widen travel sanctions for Kremlin-linked elites.",
      "The government has described the announcement, which also includes measures against North Korean generals accused of sending troops to fight Ukraine in Russia, as the UK's largest sanctions package since the early days of the invasion.",
      "Sir Keir said the G7 \"should be ready to take on more risk\" and a larger role in sanctioning Russian's oil giants, before speaking to leaders of the group of wealthy countries.",
      "The speech comes ahead of Sir Keir's meeting with President Trump at the White House on Thursday.",
      "He is expected to discuss the importance of Ukraine's independence, US security guarantees and European involvement in peace talks when he speaks to Trump.",
      "It is a high-stakes visits as European leaders scramble to put forward their own proposals for ending the war and keeping Russia at bay.",
      "President Trump has been pushing for a quick deal to end the war in Ukraine, and US and Russia have held initial talks, which excluded Ukraine and European countries.",
      "Trump has said he believes Russia has \"the cards\" in any peace talks to end the war because its military has \"taken a lot of territory\".",
      "There have been diplomatic tensions since President Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator without elections\" last week.",
      "Ukraine's elections are suspended under martial law, which has been in place since Russia's full-scale invasion was launched in February 2022.",
      "The prime minister talked about extra sanctions as one way to \"deliver an enduring peace\" in Ukraine.",
      "He said the other two ways were stepping up UK military support to Ukraine and bringing \"our collective strength to the peace effort\".",
      "\"President Trump has changed the global conversation over the last few weeks,\" Sir Keir said.",
      "\"And it has created an opportunity. Now, we must get the fundamentals right.\"",
      "He said Ukraine \"must have a seat at the table\" of peace talks and \"a US backstop will be vital to deter Russia from another invasion\".",
      "Sir Keir has spoken on the phone to French President Emmanuel Macron, who is meeting Trump in Washington on Monday.",
      "In the phone call on Sunday, Sir Keir and Macron \"compared notes\" on how best to approach President Trump, government sources told the BBC.",
      "British officials said the prime minister is keen for European military powers to present a co-ordinated pitch to the US president, and also discuss economic issues, including tariffs.",
      "European leaders and Trudeau in Ukraine for show of support on invasion anniversary",
      "Trump 'very frustrated' and Zelensky must strike minerals deal, says adviser",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who will join Starmer on his trip to the White House, said the new sanctions \"underscore the UK's commitment to Ukraine\".",
      "\"Every military supply line disrupted, every rouble blocked, and every enabler of Putin's aggression exposed is a step towards a just and lasting peace,\" he told the House of Commons.",
      "Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said her party backed the government giving Ukraine \"everything they need\" - including weapons, hardware, and diplomatic muscle - to \"decide its own future.\"",
      "Patel pressed the government to exceed her party's manifesto pledge of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030, and \"lead\" a charge for Nato nations to boost their military budgets.",
      "Earlier, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged President Zelensky to secure Ukraine's future by signing a minerals deal with the US.",
      "Johnson said he believed Ukraine would sign a \"promising\" agreement to give the US access to valuable minerals, in return for security guarantees.",
      "Zelensky had rejected a \u00a3400bn ($500bn) demand for mineral wealth, but over the weekend, US officials said they expected to sign a deal this week.",
      "In a post on X on Monday, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, said the Ukrainian and US teams were \"in the final stages of negotiations regarding the minerals agreement\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Johnson - a Zelensky ally who was prime minister when the invasion started - said claims by some Americans that Ukraine had provoked the war were \"a complete inversion of the truth\".",
      "He described Trump's comments as \"Orwellian\", and said he might as well have blamed the US for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War Two.",
      "But Johnson said it was important to focus on a minerals deal, which he called \"the great prize\" and suggested could be signed this week.",
      "He rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".",

      "Former Conservative leader Sunak, who is the MP for Richmond and Northallerton, said he wanted to \"support the charity's mission to revolutionise diagnosis and treatment\".",
      "\"Men tend to ignore pain hoping it'll go away rather than going to see the GP, and that's a part of the reason why prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer in males in the UK,\" he said.",
      "\"We can do something about that. It is clear from a trial that I funded when I was in office, that early detection saves lives.\"",
      "He added he hoped his work for the charity would encourage more men to get a screening test \"which will hopefully prevent further needless deaths\".",
      "Last month in the House of Commons, he pressed the government to consider increasing screenings for high-risk groups.",
      "Iain Ross, executive chairman of Oxford BioDynamics, said more than nine out of 10 men who received a positive EpiSwitch PSE result would have prostate cancer confirmed.",
      "This can \"significantly cut\" the number of \"expensive and unnecessary MRI scans\" and invasive prostate biopsies, he added.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 09:47:13 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after the government rejected compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age.",
    "story": [
      "Campaigners have threatened the government with legal action unless it reconsiders the decision to refuse compensation to millions of women affected by an increase in the state pension age.",
      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group is demanding payouts for 3.6 million women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of changes first introduced in the 1990s.",
      "The government apologised that the changes were not communicated quickly enough but told the BBC it \"cannot justify paying for a \u00a310.5bn compensation scheme at the expense of the taxpayer\".",
      "Waspi chair Angela Madden said: \"We believe this is not only an outrage but legally wrong.\"",
      "The \"letter before action\" that has been sent to the government is a formal mechanism to allow it a chance to respond before the campaigners seek a judicial review at the High Court in two weeks time.",
      "Last year the parliamentary ombudsman recommended payouts of up to \u00a32,950 each because of a 28-month\u00a0delay\u00a0in\u00a0writing\u00a0to\u00a0inform\u00a0the women affected of the changes.",
      "Waspi\u00a0campaigners\u00a0have\u00a0claimed\u00a0women\u00a0suffered\u00a0financial\u00a0hardship\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0to rethink\u00a0retirement\u00a0plans.",
      "However in December, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall apologised for the delayed communications but said there was \"considerable awareness\" of the changes to the pension age. She said sending letters earlier would not have made a difference to their ability to make retirement choices.",
      "Her claim there was no direct financial loss could now be examined in court if the campaigners get approval for their judicial review.",
      "What is the row about women's pensions?",
      "'I want the \u00a345,000 state pension that was stolen from me'",
      "Ms Madden said: \"We will not allow the DWP's gaslighting of Waspi women to go unchallenged.",
      "\"The government has accepted that 1950s-born women are victims of maladministration, but it now says none of us suffered any injustice.\"",
      "With no compensation forthcoming she said: \"The alternative is continued defence of the indefensible but this time in front of a judge.\"",
      "The Waspi group has also launched a crowd-funding campaign to try to cover an estimated \u00a375,000 in legal fees.",
      "If the women were to win their case it is estimated it could cost the government as much as \u00a310.5bn.",
      "With government finances already under strain because of weak economic growth and higher borrowing costs, Sir Keir Starmer has said \"the taxpayer simply can't afford the burden\" of compensation.",
      "The changes were first decided in 1995 when the then-Conservative government sought to equalise the age at which men and women received their state pensions, aiming that by 2020 everyone would have to wait until their 65th birthday.",
      "However in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2010, the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition decided to speed up the changes, to reduce the overall cost of the state pension.",
      "Other countries have made similar decisions in recent years - however the UK government did not communicate its change quickly enough and the impact of that could now be examined in court.",
      "A government spokesperson told the BBC on Sunday it accepted the ombudsman's finding of maladministration and had apologised for the 28-month delay in writing to 1950s-born women.",
      "\"However, evidence showed only one-in-four people remember reading and receiving letters that they weren't expecting and that by 2006, 90% of 1950s-born women knew that the state pension age was changing,\" they said.",

      "The talks focused on \"advancing\" the negotiations and ensuring that the deal was \"balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial\", Goyal wrote on X.",
      "The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach.",
      "Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK.",

      "\"Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,\" he said in a statement ahead of the meeting.",
      "India is forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years.",
      "The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised.",

      "London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars.",
      "India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times.",
      "It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits.",
      "Speaking at the joint conference, Goyal said that immigration was not a part of the discussions.",
      "\"India has never ever discussed immigration in any free trade negotiations,\" he said. Reynolds added that business mobility was a \"separate issue\" from immigration.",
      "During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram.",
      "UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru.",
      "After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing agreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, it signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.",
      "It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year.",

    "summary": "Bridget Phillipson says the US thawing diplomatic ties with Putin \"brought Russians to the table\".",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump was right to re-establish links with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to set up peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, a senior Labour minister has said.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there could be \"no negotiated peace without Russia\" and that Trump's approach had brought \"Russians to the table\".",
      "The US president has faced a backlash for excluding Ukraine from talks after his aides met Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. Trump has also suggested Ukraine may be a bystander, saying it has \"no cards\" in the deal.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will meet Trump in Washington this week and press for Ukraine to be \"at the heart\" of any peace talks.",
      "Ukraine hit by largest single Russian drone attack of war on eve of third anniversary",
      "Rosenberg: How Putin and Trump shook up the world in a week",
      "I'll back Ukraine in talks with Trump, Starmer says",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson said that Trump thawing diplomatic ties with Russia and Putin was \"the right approach\".",
      "\"President Trump has brought the Russians to the table,\" she added.",
      "When asked by Kuenssberg if welcoming Putin back was the right move, Phillipson said, \"absolutely\".",
      "\"There can be no settlement, no negotiated peace, without Russia,\" she said.",
      "She added \"any lasting settlement where it comes to peace does require Ukrainian voices, President Zelensky's voice to be a central part of that.",
      "\"There can be no settlement unless we have a negotiation involving both Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"We are however, also clear of the risk that Russian President Putin poses to our interest.\"",
      "Shortly after coming to office, Trump held a phone call with Putin in which the leaders agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. It was the first phone-call to Putin by a US president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "It was a significant thawing of the US relationship with Russia. Trump's predecessor Joe Biden previously called Putin a \"murderous dictator\" and a \"pure thug\".",
      "Since the call Trump has claimed Putin wants to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine - arguing Russia did not necessarily have to negotiate a ceasefire, because it could take \"the whole country\" by force.",
      "Trump has instead turned on Zelensky in recent days, calling him a \"dictator without elections,\" claiming he was doing a \"terrible job\" and falsely suggesting he was the one who started the war with Russia.",
      "Trump's short-term goal is to stop the fighting in Ukraine. Longer term, he appears to want less US involvement, given that the country has sent tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Kyiv.",
      "The White House is pushing Ukraine to sign a $500bn (\u00a3395bn) minerals deal, which would give the US control over half of Ukraine's mineral resources - which the Trump administration describes this as \"payback\" for earlier US military assistance.",
      "The Ukrainian president had rejected the initial US proposal made several days ago, saying he \"cannot sell our state\".",
      "In a video address late on Friday, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US teams were working on a draft agreement, which \"can add value to our relations\". But he stressed that \"what matters most is getting the details right\".",
      "Sir Keir is seeking to balance support for Ukraine with keeping his working relationship with Trump.",
      "This weekend, Sir Keir assured Zelensky of the UK's \"ironclad support\" for Kyiv. The comments came in the second telephone conversation in four days between the two leaders.",
      "It comes ahead of a big week of diplomacy, as Sir Keir heads to the White House on Thursday shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron visits Washington on Monday.",
      "While making his pitch to Trump this week, Sir Keir is expected to set out a path for the UK to increase spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2030 - in line with Labour's election manifesto commitment.",
      "European countries raising defence spending and becoming less reliant on the US for has been a key demand from Trump.",
      "In his push for Nato allies to shoulder more of the security burden, Trump has suggested European nations to commit at least 5% of GDP to defence.",
      "In a speech to the Scottish Labour Conference in Glasgow on Sunday, Sir Keir said \"the US is right\" that \"we Europeans - including the United Kingdom - have to do more for our defence and security\".",
      "The UK also must stand \"ready to play our role if a force is required in Ukraine once a peace agreement is reached\", he said.",
      "Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge has called on the government to \"go further and faster\" on increasing defence spending.",
      "Earlier this week, the Liberal Democrats said there should be a national conversation on how to get to a target of 3% of GDP spent on defence.",
      "But Cartlidge refused to say how much the Tories would invest until they see the details of this year's strategic defence review.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cartlidge said the UK was going to have to \"invest much more in hard power\" and boost spending on \"the military\".",
      "The Conservatives have argued welfare budgets and foreign aid could be cut to pay for increases in defence.",
      "Cartlidge said his party backed Labour's efforts to ensure Ukraine is involved in any peace talks to ensure lasting peace.",
      "\"Because if Russia is seen to in any way 'win' from any settlement, should there be one, I think that would send a terrible signal to other adversaries like China,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 08:04:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Last week the Isle of Man came very close to axing a policy no UK politician dares touch.",
    "story": [
      "A pensions timebomb is ticking on the Isle of Man and the self-governing island off the UK's west coast came very close to defusing it last week.",
      "Like the UK, the island protects state pensions with the triple lock, which automatically increases the state pension each year by the maximum of three measures: price inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.",
      "The Isle of Man's government wanted to scrap the triple lock for some pensioners in its budget last week.",
      "But ministers were forced to back down following a backlash from members of the island's parliament, who argued the change was \"unfair\" on pensioners and was being rushed through without a proper debate.",
      "The U-turn is a cautionary tale for critics of the triple lock in the UK.",
      "It underlines the political difficulty of watering down the income of pensioners who tend to vote in greater numbers than younger age groups at elections.",
      "One former UK Treasury adviser told the BBC: \"It's politically too difficult to come up with a pension policy that does not involve committing to the triple lock. It's such a vulnerability in an election campaign.\"",
      "'A lose, lose, lose scenario'",
      "The triple lock was introduced by David Cameron's 2010 coalition government and has proved a reliable way of wooing the grey vote for every administration since.",
      "But it has also become steadily more expensive, as the population ages.",
      "Between 2022 and 2032, the number of pensioners in the UK is projected to increase by 13.8%, according to the ONS.",
      "Meanwhile the fertility rate is declining, suggesting there could be fewer UK-born people entering the workforce and paying taxes to cover welfare costs, including pensions.",
      "The government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said spending on pensioners is forecast to rise from \u00a3141bn this year to \u00a3182bn by 2030.",
      "In the Irish Sea, the cost pressures of keeping the triple lock are similarly intimidating politicians on the Isle of Man.",
      "With a population of about 84,000, and a declining birth rate, the Isle of Man has a higher proportion of over 65s than the UK as a whole - 22.5% compared with 19% - and forecasts show the number of retirees on the island is expected to grow.",
      "A report last year suggested, without reform, the fund that pays out the state pension could run out by 2047.",
      "In the UK, the population trends are only going in the same direction, and they look daunting for whichever party wins the next general election, due in 2029 at the latest.",
      "\"The politics here are a nightmare,\" said David Sinclair, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre - UK. \"The problem is that none of the alternatives to removing the triple lock are going to be popular.\"",
      "A return to some model of earnings link is favoured by many economists.",
      "Mr Sinclair said to keep the triple lock, government may have to take on more debt, increase the pension age, raise taxes, or potentially all of the above.",
      "\"For government it's a lose, lose, lose scenario,\" Mr Sinclair said.",
      "He said the Labour government \"will be terrified about even suggesting a cut to the triple lock\" after the outcry over its decision to withdraw the winter fuel allowance from all but poor pensioners.",
      "The government is raising the state pension by 4.1% this April, on a par with average earnings.",
      "A government spokesperson said its commitment to the triple lock was \"unwavering\" and meant \"millions will see their state pension rise by up to \u00a31,900 over this parliament\".",
      "In the Conservative camp, there have been hints of a shift in attitude to pensions.",
      "Speaking on LBC, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the Conservatives were \"going to look at means-testing\" benefits, in response to a question about the state pension. Her party later insisted she was not referring to the triple lock specifically.",
      "Also, the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, has said the triple lock was unsustainable in \"the very, very long term\".",
      "A Conservative source said Stride's comments had been taken out of context and the party was committed to the triple lock.",
      "Politically sensitive",
      "Neither Reform UK nor the Greens mentioned the triple lock in their election manifestos last year, while the Liberal Democrats supported its continuation.",
      "That was no surprise given they mooted the idea in their 2010 manifesto, albeit without the triple lock tag.",
      "Two sources close to the 2010 coalition talks said what became the triple lock was a minor detail in the Tory-Lib Dem agreement, with one saying the Treasury estimated it would cost \u00a350m over a five-year period.",
      "\"Clearly the triple lock will stop at some point,\" Steve Webb, the former Liberal Democrat MP and pensions minister who implemented the policy, told the BBC. \"It was never intended to be permanent.\"",
      "Webb said it was a tool used to \"undo 30 years of damage\" to pensioner living standards, but added \"there will come a point when it's done its job\".",
      "Such is the sensitivity of the issue, few current MPs or anyone actively involved in Westminster politics are willing to talk openly about when that time might come.",
      "One MP, who did not wish to be named, said the triple lock would not be dropped anytime soon, even though there were convincing arguments for doing so.",
      "For now, there's a stubborn silence and talk of tossing out the triple lock remains taboo among this generation of political leaders.",
      "Given the backlash against the watering down of the triple lock on the Isle of Man, the MPs of the future may view what's happening on the island with some trepidation.",

    "summary": "What could happen when Sir Keir Starmer visits the White House next Thursday?",
    "story": [
      "The next seven days really matter.",
      "\"The most negative thing would be a gruesome sell-out of Ukraine and we get slapped with tariffs,\" says a source involved in working out the best moves for No 10 as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to head to the White House to meet President Donald Trump.",
      "\"The better version is Trump returns to a bit more robust behaviour with the Russians, Britain gets patted on the back for making a move on defence spending and we avoid all the tariffs \u2013 a Trumpportunity.\"",
      "With Whitehall-style understatement, a different official predicts the PM \"has a really big decision to make about what to say to Trump in private\" \u2013 remember, just this week the president accused Sir Keir of \"doing nothing\" to try and stop the Ukraine conflict.",
      "So what options does Sir Keir have?",
      "A decision on defence spending is the big focus. The drumbeat of demands for the UK to boost spending was getting louder even before Trump moved into the White House.",
      "The government hasn't yet committed to when it will hit its target of spending 2.5% of the size of the economy, let alone if it will go a lot further as military leaders, Nato, Trump, and now even the Liberal Democrats are calling for.",
      "A senior government source says the PM is \"pushing the system\" to get to a stronger position on spending, but in recent days it's suggested the Treasury's still asking about the spending consequences. The dilemma is obvious: public money is tight as a drum, and Downing Street doesn't want to take cash from the NHS or other priorities at home.",
      "But a Treasury source acknowledged \"the world is changing\", and sources describe a \"phenomenal\" opportunity to take the European lead and please Trump with cash promises.",
      "A Trump backer warns against anything lukewarm: \"a proper commitment, not just a road map, or a path \u2013 be more specific, say 'Yes we'll hit it by this date,' and throw in some more\".",
      "\"He's going to have to do 3% [or more],\" one Whitehall insider suggests, \"so the choice is, does it do it now, for the right reasons, make a virtue of it, or does he end up getting browbeaten into it by Trump?\"",
      "I'm told that there is no final decision on what to say \u2013 and crucial meetings are planned between ministers, officials and military advisers at the start of next week to decide.",
      "What next for Ukraine?",
      "Ukraine is, clearly, central to the talks, and the question looms over what happens if Trump gets the ceasefire he wants.",
      "In the last week UK and French military planners have been working on options, all of which are at an early stage. One idea is  that a \"reassurance\" force of perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 UK and French troops could be deployed after a ceasefire around Ukrainian infrastructure, ports, nuclear power stations, even in some of the key cities.",
      "The model of a joint UK-French force already exists \u2013 the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, a deal signed by the two countries several years ago. Another source suggests the best option for a monitoring force would be under the badge of the UN, if the Russians could be persuaded to accept that, with Ukraine's allies stepping up training and support for Ukraine inside the country.",
      "These options in broad terms, given a public airing by Sir Keir Starmer this week, aren't new, one adviser says, and have been suggested in private for a long time. Another source in government says the plan for 30,000 troops is \"not yet an actual thing\" \u2013 there's no detailed blueprint.",
      "But European leaders know they have to prove to Trump they are serious about contributing to a lasting peace, rather than leaving it to the United States.",
      "I'm told when French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump and Zelensky met in the margins of the fanciest international get together of recent times, the reopening of Notre Dame, Trump said that he'd get Russia to the table, Zelensky said that he would go to the negotiating table, and Macron promised he'd make sure Europe played a real part.",
      "It's worth noting that Trump said \"that's great, I'm all for that\", when asked earlier this week about the idea of European troops being deployed was mentioned.",
      "'We know who the goodies are'",
      "But as the talks approach, uncertainty about the US' true view is the fundamental, and some in government are nervous. Does Trump really believe that Zelensky is a \"dictator\" \u2013 or, as Trump's Ukraine envoy suggested yesterday, a \"courageous leader\"? Does Trump want the \"sugar rush\" of a quick deal that might favour Russia asks one former defence minister, more than achieving something long-term?",

      "There is though anxiety in government that Trump might be tempted to just force a deal to end the conflict, then Russia could \"just reload then go again\", according to another source.",
      "But there is a shaky faith \u2013 perhaps more accurately a fervent hope \u2013 that whatever the president's public remarks, that the US will try to involve Ukraine in the talks and does think the peace has to be a deal that lasts, with a force that looks credible, potentially with some form of American support.",

    "story": [
      "BP is expected to announce it will slash its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant will outline its strategy later following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been much lower than its rivals.",
      "Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have already scaled back their plans to invest in green energy. Meanwhile US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels and a move away from low carbon projects.",
      "Some shareholders and environmental groups have voiced concerns over any potential ramping up on production of fossil fuels.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "In 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "It is now expected to abandon it altogether while confirming it is cutting investments in renewable energy by more than half in what chief executive Murray Auchincloss called a \"fundamental reset\".",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",

      "Since 2020 when former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36% over the last five years. In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",
      "Not all shareholders want the company to change course so radically.",

      "Senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick said: \"Government policies will also need to prioritise renewable power, and as extreme weather puts pressure on insurance models - policymakers will be looking to fossil fuel profits as a way to fund extreme weather recovery. BP might want to seriously put the brakes on this U-turn.\"",

      "\"They need to prove to people that after a difficult operational and share price performance compared to their peers, that they're looking to do something about it, not just let things drift along, he added.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "The refocus on oil and gas could also see sales of other businesses in order to get \"non-core stuff off the books\" as insiders describe it.",
      "It is over 20 years since former chief executive Lord John Browne said BP could stand for \"Beyond Petroleum\" as he launched the company's first tentative moves away from oil and gas.",

    "story": [
      "Skywatchers are in for a treat this week as seven planets - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn will all be briefly visible in the evening sky.",
      "This phenomenon, known as a 'planetary parade' is a rare sight, and it will be the last time seven planets can be seen simultaneously so well until 2040.",
      "The best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",
      "Four of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. Saturn will be harder to see because it will be low in the horizon. You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune.",
      "A good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. However, the window to see all seven planets will be very brief.",
      "Dr Edward Bloomer, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich said: \"There's a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.\"",
      "As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will also be setting, making them particularly difficult to see.",
      "\"You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,\" Dr Bloomer added.",
      "The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth.",
      "As they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space.",
      "Send us your pictures of the planetary parade.",
      "Send us your pictures of the planetary parade.",
      "Venus and Jupiter will be the easiest to spot due to their brightness, while Mars will have a distinct reddish hue.",
      "\"Uranus is technically visible with the naked eye, but you'd need perfect eyesight and ideal conditions,\" Dr Bloomer explains.",
      "To improve your chances of seeing as many planets as possible, Dr Bloomer advises heading to a location with a clear view of the horizon and minimal light pollution.",
      "\"If you just pop out of your kitchen into your back garden, you will take time to adjust to the light levels. Give it a bit of time - your eyes take about half an hour to fully adjust,\" said Dr Bloomer.",
      "\"Avoid looking at your phone, get comfortable, and ensure you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.\"",
      "While this is an exciting opportunity, Dr Bloomer encourages people to make a habit of gazing at the night sky.",
      "\"See how things change,\" he said, adding that observing the heavens is \"a chance to witness the ongoing mechanics of the solar system at work.\"",
      "Will the skies be clear enough to see them all this week?",
      "Whilst the weather is still rather unsettled currently, clearer and calmer conditions are expected to develop later in the week.",
      "Tuesday evening will start with clear spells, but cloud and rain will move in from the west later.",
      "On Wednesday night, skies will be generally cloudier with showery rain at times.",
      "By Thursday, expect a drier, clearer view of the night sky. Earlier in the evening is best, as mist and fog patches may develop further into the night.",
      "For Friday high pressure is expected to dominate, keeping dry conditions for most with clear spells. Soon after sunset is most favoured as mist and fog patches may develop later.",

    "title": "The asteroid hits and near-misses you never hear about",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:33:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Since a potentially hazardous asteroid was detected in December, tens of others objects have come close to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "A large asteroid known as 2024 YR4 has grabbed headlines this week as scientists first raised its chances of hitting earth, then lowered them.",
      "The latest estimate says the object has a 0.28% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, significantly lower than the 3.1% chance earlier in the week.",
      "Scientists say it is now more likely to smash into the Moon, with Nasa estimating the probability of that happening at 1%.",
      "But in the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile two months ago, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon, which in astronomical terms sounds like a near miss.",
      "It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.",
      "This is the story of the asteroids that you never hear about \u2013 the fly-bys, the near-misses and the direct hits.",
      "The vast majority are harmless. But some carry the most valuable clues for unlocking mysteries in our universe, information we are desperate to get our hands on.",
      "Asteroids, also sometimes called minor planets, are rocky pieces left over from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.",
      "Rocks routinely orbit close to Earth, pushed by the gravity of other planets.",
      "For most of human history, it has been impossible to know how close we have come to being struck by a large asteroid.",
      "Serious monitoring of objects near Earth only started in the late 20th century, explains Professor Mark Boslough from the University of New Mexico. \"Before that we were blissfully oblivious to them,\" he says.",
      "We now know that quite large objects - 40m across or more - pass between Earth and the Moon several times a year. That's the same size of asteroid that exploded over Siberia in 1908 injuring people and damaging buildings over 200 square miles.",
      "The most serious near-miss, and the closest comparison with YR4, was an asteroid called Apophis which was first spotted in 2004 and measured 375 meters across, or around the size of a cruise ship.",
      "Professor Patrick Michel from French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) tracked Apophis and recalls it was considered the most hazardous asteroid ever detected.",
      "It took until 2013 to get enough observations to understand that it was not going to hit Earth.",
      "But he says there was one big difference with YR4. \"We didn't know what to do. We discovered something, we determined an impact probability, and then thought, who do we call?\" he says. Scientists and governments had no idea how to respond, he says.",
      "A large asteroid strike could be catastrophic if it hits an area where humans live.",
      "We don't know exactly how big YR4 is yet, but if it is at the top end of estimates, about 90m across, it would likely remain substantially intact rather than break up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "\"The surviving asteroid mass could create a crater. Structures in the immediate vicinity would likely be destroyed and people within the local region (dozens of kilometers) would be at risk of serious injury,\" explains Professor Kathryn Kunamoto from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Some people could die.",
      "But since Apophis, there have been huge advances in what is called planetary defence.",
      "Prof Michel is part of the international Space Mission Planning Advisory Group.",
      "Its delegates advise governments on how to respond to an asteroid threat and run rehearsal exercise for direct hits. There is one going on right now.",
      "If the asteroid was on course for a town or city, Dr Boslough compares the response to preparations made for a major hurricane, including evacuations and measures to protect infrastructure.",
      "The Space Mission Planning Advisory Group will meet again in April to decide what to do about YR4.",
      "By then most scientists expect the risk to have almost entirely gone, as their calculations of its trajectory become more precise.",
      "We do have options beyond \"taking a hit\", as Dr Kumamoto puts it.",
      "Nasa and the European Space Agency have developed technologies to nudge dangerous asteroids off course.",
      "Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully slammed a spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos to change its path.",
      "However scientists are sceptical if that would work in the case of YR4 due to uncertainty about what it is made of and the short window of time to successfully deflect it.",
      "And what about the asteroids that do hit Earth? An awkward truth for scientists is that a direct strike on land far from humans is the ideal scenario for asteroids.",
      "That gives them actual pieces from distant objects within of our solar system, as well as insights into Earth's impact history.",
      "Nearly 50,000 asteroids have been found in Antarctica. The most famous, called ALH 84001, is believed to have originated on Mars and contains minerals with vital evidence about the planet's history, suggesting it was warm and had water on its surface billions of years ago.",
      "In 2023 scientists detected an asteroid called 33 Polyhymnia which could have an element denser than anything found on Earth.",
      "This superheavy element would be something entirely new to our planet. 33 Polyhymnia is at least 170 million kilometers away, but it's an indication of the incredible potential of asteroids for our understanding of science.",
      "Now that the chances are higher that YR4 will hit the Moon, some scientists are getting excited about that.",
      "An impact could give real-world answers to questions they have only been able to simulate using computers.",
      "\"To have even one data point of a real example would be incredibly powerful,\" says Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London.",
      "\"How much material comes out when the asteroid hits? How fast does it go? How far does that travel?\" he asks.",
      "It would help them test the scenarios they have modelled about asteroid impacts on Earth, helping create better predictions.",
      "YR4 has reminded us that we live on a planet vulnerable to collisions with something the solar system is full of \u2013 rocks.",
      "Scientists warn against complacency, saying it is a matter of when, not if, a large asteroid will threaten human life on Earth, although most expect that to be in the coming centuries rather than decades.",
      "In the meantime, our ability to monitor space keeps improving. Later this year the largest digital camera ever built will begin working at the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, able to capture the night sky in incredible detail.",

      "Its construction is predicted to require a workforce of 7,900 people, with about two thirds moving from outside the area, and some people in nearby Leiston have claimed \"landlords are cashing in\" by raising rents.",
      "Linda Druce, director and founder of Druce Estate & Letting Agents, said: \"I have been in the area for 21 years now and this is the first time we have seen such a significant jump, particularly in rental prices.\"",
      "Leiston, located between the more affluent coastal towns of Aldeburgh and Southwold, had traditionally been viewed as a more affordable place to live.",
      "But one sales negotiator, who did not want to be named, said family homes in the area that were normally rented for \u00a31,500 a month were now costing as much as \u00a33,000.",
      "It is a claim which was corroborated by Ms Druce.",
      "\"It is mainly because of Sizewell C contractors and those looking to be working here over the next year or two who are looking to rent,\" she said.",
      "\"The core of our clients are not likely to jump into wanting to get higher rents but we are seeing more people from out of the area who are buying buy-to-let properties.",
      "\"And quite frankly the local people who own them are more than happy to sell to the highest and best bidder.\"",
      "One of the family homes with a rent of \u00a33,000 a month - a fee which includes bills and cleaning costs - is a three bedroom semi-detached property in Carr Avenue.",
      "The home, which is being let by Hamilton Smith estate agents, has two bathrooms and is described as being fully furnished and \"beautifully presented\".",
      "Luke Vale, who owns Hamilton Smith, described the situation in the town as a \"housing concern\".",
      "\"Although that property is being marketed through us and to a particular set of clientele, we are still actively trying to look after our current clients,\" he said.",
      "\"We look after hundreds of properties in Leiston. I am having to deal with tenants who are terrified that their landlords are going to kick them out just so they can go down this route to make more money.",
      "\"But that doesn't factor in the number of landlords we have who do not want to increase their rent and are actually really good.",
      "\"The problem is a lot of landlords see pound signs and then the floodgates open and so, at the moment, if I put a house up for sale in Leiston, nine times out of 10 the viewing will be with someone who wants to buy it and rent it out per room.\"",
      "Elsewhere in the town, another three-bedroom home is being advertised at a cost of \u00a33,100 a month including bills, while a two-bedroom apartment is being let at a rate of \u00a33,045 a month, including utility bills.",
      "The current cost of renting in the area has raised eyebrows, not least given the average rent in Leiston is \u00a3773, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "Sizewell C said 2,400 of the workers at the new power station will be based on site, while 500 others will live at Pontins Pakefield, near Lowestoft.",
      "The remaining contractors, however, will have to move into local properties.",
      "Alison Downes, from the campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: \"If Sizewell C goes ahead thousands more workers from outside the area will need accommodation and if those numbers increase, like at Hinkley Point C, where they are going up to a staggering 15,000, the people of Leiston will face many years more pain.\"",
      "It is not just landlords who could capitalise on the influx of workers heading into the area.",
      "Residents in Leiston who have spare rooms or spaces can apply to East Suffolk Council for a Sizewell C Housing Grant, which range from \u00a33,000 to \u00a37,000, as the authority looks to provide an additional 1,200 bed spaces during the construction.",
      "\"[These] provide funding to help local people bring latent accommodation back into use or upgrade their spare rooms to rent for extra income at a time when the cost of living is still a real challenge for a lot of people,\" said a Sizewell C spokesperson.",
      "Despite this, the suggestion Sizewell C could be driving up prices does not sit well with tenants who currently live in the area.",
      "'Money talks'",
      "Louise Smith, 54, said it was \"unfair\" local people might no longer be able to afford to live in Leiston \"because of Sizewell\".",
      "She added: \"The rents will go up and up and up because everyone is jumping on the bandwagon and the landlords are cashing in on it.",
      "\"They can just pick a figure out of the air and demand what they like because Mr Bloggs over there can pay that and Mr Smith over there can't.",

    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",

      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",

      "Since 2020 when former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36% over the last five years. In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",

    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 06:11:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has made headlines by pulling its most advanced data security tool for UK customers.",
      "It is removing Advanced Data Protection (ADP) after the Home Office asked for the right to be able to access data which it is applied to - something even Apple itself cannot currently do.",
      "Rather than comply with that request, on Friday the tech giant said it would halt new UK sign-ups to the tool and remove existing user access at a later date.",
      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "Items including back-ups, photos, notes and voice memos are given standard encryption by default.",
      "The company can be ordered to hand over this data by law enforcement.",
      "ADP, meanwhile, applies an extra level of protection through what's known as end to end encryption, which means Apple cannot see or access the data - only the user can.",
      "Because Apple does not have a key, losing access to your account can mean losing your data altogether.",
      "It also means law enforcement agencies have no way of accessing such data either.",
      "The tool is independent of the protections for blue messages sent with iMessage, passwords stored in iCloud keychain, Health app data and Facetime, which are end to end encrypted by default.",
      "What does this mean for my iCloud data?",
      "If you are in the UK and have not turned on ADP, you will not see a change to the way your data is protected as a result of Apple disabling it.",
      "Your iCloud data will remain protected by standard encryption and, as before, can still be accessed by Apple.",
      "But it does mean you now cannot apply to protect iCloud storage with end to end encryption, even if you want to.",
      "Meanwhile, people in the UK who had ADP enabled prior to Friday's change will lose access to it a later date.",
      "Apple has not said when, nor how many UK users will be affected.",
      "Some experts have raised alarm over its removal, saying it will leave users less protected and also have wider, global consequences.",
      "Graeme Stewart of cybersecurity firm Check Point said it would not mean \"a complete free-for-all\" as law enforcement must have a warrant to request iCloud data.",
      "But he said other governments may look to replicate the UK's demand of Apple for a so-called \"backdoor\" to encrypted cloud data.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have likened the idea of creating a backdoor to someone leaving their house keys under their doormat - essentially creating a vulnerability which anyone, including bad actors, can exploit.",
      "Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that if Apple had complied with the request, it would have created a backdoor not just for UK users \"but for people around the world, regardless of where they were or what citizenship they had\".",
      "Apple told the BBC in a statement that it had \"never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will\".",
      "What protections do Google and Android offer?",
      "Like Apple, Google says it uses standard encryption across a range of its services to protect data as it moves between users' devices, its services and data centres.",
      "The search giant, which owns Android, has provided further protections for Android phone system back-ups since 2018.",
      "It uses a mechanism that generates a random security key on a device, which is encrypted by a user's lock-screen passcode, pattern or pin.",
      "Google says it cannot see this security key and that the passcode-protected information is sent securely to high security chips in its data centres.",
      "But the same protections do not extend to Google Photos or content stored in Google Drive - which are not end to end encrypted.",
      "It also has an Advanced Protection Program for people who want further security for their account.",
      "This relies on using passkeys to verify the account holder.",
      "Some Samsung Galaxy smartphones also have \"enhanced data protection\" which encrypts back-ups of messages, call logs, apps and settings and more end to end.",

      "She also said the US writers' strike which led to a slow-down in demand for VFX work causing \"severe\" pressure on cashflow.",

      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

    "summary": "It found they were easily able to bypass age checks on apps, which face being banned for under-16s.",
    "story": [
      "More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.",
      "It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.",
      "The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.",
      "The regulator accused the apps of \"a lack of robust interventions\" for checking the ages of their users.",
      "The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube.",
      "Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.",
      "For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children.",
      "In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason.",
      "It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force.",
      "\"The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps,\" said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant.",
      "Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users.",
      "In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram -  took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. \"This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,\" said a TikTok spokesperson.",
      "\"Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision.\"",
      "A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies.",
      "'84% use social media'",
      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",
      "They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.",
      "Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.",
      "The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.",
      "If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year.",
      "'Inconsistency'",
      "\"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,\" the report's authors said.",
      "\"However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account.\"",
      "The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users.",
      "Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service.",
      "\"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,\" the report said.",
      "\"This may require time and engagement to detect a child under 13, and in that time the child may be exposed to risks and harms.\""

      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",
      "\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".",
      "Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.",
      "According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.",
      "\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.",
      "Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"",
      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",
      "\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"",
      "Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.",
      "Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.",
      "\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"",
      "Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.",
      "\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"",
      "Mr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

    "title": "Will quantum computers disrupt critical infrastructure?",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:40:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",
      "\"With cryptography,\" says Mr Dupressoir \"If somebody breaks your system, you will only know once they've got your data.\"",

      "Another 300 million are \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact.",
      "What is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not \"widening\" as much as it is \"deepening\", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier.",
      "All of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of \"premiumisation\" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings.",
      "This is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market.

      "In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%.",
      "The latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses.",
      "The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.",
      "Much of the consumption spending of the \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and \"turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption\", says Pai.",
      "In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget.

    "summary": "Shares in the US electric carmaker dropped after European sales halved in January.",
    "story": [
      "Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January.",
      "The drop in Tesla shares took the company's valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024.",
      "Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.",
      "In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.",
      "Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.",
      "Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more that 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.",
      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",
      "Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.",
      "However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said.",
      "Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.",
      "In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised prime minister Sir Keir Starmer.",
      "Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections.",
      "Too toxic?",
      "Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".",
      "\"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\"",
      "Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president.",
      "Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.",
      "However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.",
      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",
      "There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added."

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:59:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As Syria's interim leader plans its future, Kurds in the north-east are battling Turkish-backed forces.",
    "story": [
      "To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.",
      "This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.",
      "But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain.",
      "As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.",
      "The fight against IS",
      "A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.",
      "IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.",
      "Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.",
      "At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).",
      "As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.",
      "But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.",
      "For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. \"Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,\" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. \"It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.\"",
      "Conflict with Turkey",
      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.",
      "Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.",
      "Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.",
      "As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.",
      "Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: \"Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.\"",
      "In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.",
      "Newrouz Ahmad says that having \"defeated IS in Kobane\u2026 we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too\".",
      "At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. \"I am 60,\" he says.",
      "It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.",
      "And now the threat of another battle is looming.",
      "Reported attacks on civilians",
      "Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.",
      "In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.",
      "She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.",
      "The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing.  The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.",
      "\"An old man next to me was also injured,\" she tells me from her bed.",
      "\"I lost some blood\u2026 but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,\" she adds.",
      "Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an \"apparent war crime\" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.",
      "The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that \"reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth\" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a \"conflict-ridden area on purpose\" to use them as \"human shields\u2026 in order to not to lose control on the said dam\".",
      "It accused the SDF of using \"violence and terror\" to pursue \"its own separatist agenda\", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.",
      "The Damascus dilemma",
      "Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.",
      "The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.",
      "But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies \u2013 Turkey.",
      "And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.",
      "Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.",
      "But the two sides have still not reached an agreement.",
      "\"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,\" he says, adding: \"In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.",
      "\"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,\" he says.",
      "For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.",
      "Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.",
      "But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.",
      "It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.",
      "\"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,\" he warns. \"That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.\"",
      "Uncertain future",
      "There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.",
      "The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.",
      "\"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,\" she says. \"Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?\"",
      "Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.",
      "\"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?\" she asks.",
      "So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?"

      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",

      "Her attackers came over the wall from the men's block right next door called \"Safina\", she says.",

      "Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region.",
      "Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail.",
      "Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape.",
      "By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources.",

      "She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead.",
      "She walks through the main yard of the women's section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head.",
      "\"At one point I didn't know what was happening any more,\" she says. \"It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved.\"",

      "Nadine says she was also raped by two men.",
      "\"They came with alcohol,\" she tells the BBC. \"They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here.\"",
      "The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held.",
      "Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out.",
      "\"I don't think that justice can exist in Congo,\" she says. \"I condemn the way the government is running things.\"",
      "The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east.",

      "It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence.",
      "She says \"children started to die\" when tear gas was fired into the women's section.",
      "\"The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,\" Florence says.",
      "\"When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,\" she adds.",

      "However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates.",
      "\"You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women's prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform.\"",
      "Florence says she heard \"bullets crackling\" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside.",
      "\"If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation.\"",
      "Some of the prisoners who broke into the women's section were looking for a safer escape route, she says.",
      "They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed.  But soon that gap was filled - by the fire.",
      "Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body.",
      "\"People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn't count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks,\" Florence tells the BBC.",
      "She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives.",
      "\"The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out.\"",

      "Florence says the women's prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors.  They were offered no help.",
      "\"Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were,\" she says.",
      "By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling.",
      "The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison.",
      "In a tent in the grounds of Goma's hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend.",
      "She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine.",
      "But her agony is more than physical.",
      "Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison.",
      "\"I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don't know what. She died on the spot,\" Sifa tells the BBC.",
      "She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was \"without sin\". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother's side.",
      "How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter?",
      "She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence.",
      "The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out.",
      "Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:47:56 GMT",
    "summary": "As the first European leader to visit Trump since his inauguration, Macron navigated potentially testing talks.",
    "story": [
      "Relations between Europe and the US are unquestionably in crisis, so merely keeping things together as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the White House on Monday stands as an achievement.",
      "He did that by praising, flattering and gently cajoling the US president as they took questions in the Oval Office and held a joint news conference. This is a playbook that many leaders around the world now see as more productive than outright plain speaking or criticism of Trump.",
      "Macron managed to navigate what could have been a tricky day in Washington without conceding or revealing too much.",
      "He spoke of both countries wanting peace, and while he gently corrected one of Trump's claims on Europe's support for Ukraine, he also agreed that Europe needed to take more responsibility for its own security.",
      "But Macron did make one important concession \u2013 that Trump was right to re-establish some kind of relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
      "That is in sharp contrast to the view up until now in London, Paris and Berlin, which have all pursued a policy of isolating Putin and slapping sanctions on Russian industries and individuals.",
      "\"There is good reason for President Trump to re-engage with President Putin,\" Macron said, adding that the new administration represented \"a big change\".",
      "Peace must not mean surrendering Ukraine, Macron saysZelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year'Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Peace must not mean surrendering Ukraine, Macron says",
      "Zelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year'",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Macron held out the prospect of European countries such as France and the UK being willing to play a leading role in ensuring the security of a post-truce Ukraine, possibly in the form of air power and troops stationed away from the frontline.",
      "But at the same time, he stressed the importance of having an American backstop.",
      "Macron, however, did not get a commitment of US back-up from his meeting in the Oval Office. And if he was looking for a scintilla of criticism of the Russian president from Trump, then he did not get that either.",
      "What he did get was, at least to some extent, Europe's voice back at the table and he, along with other European leaders, will take some heart from that.",
      "It is clear however, that the ambitions for re-establishing the kind of close relationship that Europe and the US have had since the end of World War Two are not on anyone's roadmap.",
      "That is why Macron himself has been working on the idea of a more strategically autonomous Europe for some time, toying with ideas of combined European defence forces.",
      "His sense that Europe needs to adapt given the dramatic shift in the US position is shared by Friedrich Merz, who will be Germany's next chancellor.",
      "Merz has already said that he believes the US under Donald Trump is indifferent to Europe's fate, and that the continent needs to be independent of the US in terms of security.",
      "\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said.",
      "But France, the UK and Germany have also got to be cognisant of the fact that not all European powers are so hostile to the US view on Ukraine.",
      "The rise of far-right nationalist parties in Europe, most notably in places like Germany where the AfD came second in Sunday's elections, suggests some European citizens are also sceptical about the continent's continued support for Kyiv.",
      "Later this week, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who has been closely co-ordinating with his French counterpart, will come to Washington to reinforce their case on Ukraine.",
      "He, like Macron, believes his country has a special relationship with the US which can open doors and get a fair hearing.",
      "The problem is that Washington in the shape of Donald Trump is on transmit mode at the moment \u2013 pushing an agenda that leaves little room for the opinion of others.",
      "And while America has always had the ability to flex its muscles and get its way, Europe for the most part has not been on the receiving end. The fact that has changed is a sign of just how serious this rupture in established alliances has become.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 15:41:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has got Nigeria talking about the past and what might have been.",
    "story": [
      "Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993.",
      "A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend.",
      "Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time.",
      "Here are four takeaways from the book:",
      "The 1993 elections annulment",
      "This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.",
      "In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.",
      "The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil.",
      "The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.",
      "Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.",
      "Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote.",
      "However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.",
      "\"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes.",
      "At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country\u2019s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.",
      "Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later.",
      "Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.",
      "Abiola\u2019s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.",
      "\"Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,\u201d he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections.",
      "Execution of a childhood friend",
      "General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.",
      "\"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls.",
      "\"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\"",
      "However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers.",
      "\"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\"",
      "Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.",
      "\"I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,\" he writes.",
      "Nigeria's first coup",
      "Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.",
      "The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects.",
      "He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.",
      "The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.",
      "The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.",
      "Babangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.",
      "\"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.\"",
      "The association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war.",
      "Remembering the Biafra war that many prefer to forget",
      "Remembering the Biafra war that many prefer to forget",
      "The love story with Maryam Babangida",
      "Many Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential first lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried.",
      "\"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled - and she often smiled - her face lit up, and her eyes danced,\" he writes.",
      "\"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.",
      "\"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,\" Babangida says.",
      "He describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.",

      "That \"firewall\" - Brandmauer in German - has worked since the end of World War Two, but AfD joint leader Tino Chrupalla says: \"Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them.\"",
      "There is a determination among all of Germany's main parties to keep that block in place - and the German public backs them up: 69% see the AfD as a threat to democracy, according to voters surveyed on Sunday.",
      "Friedrich Merz, who won the election for the conservatives, believes the only reason the AfD exists is because of problems such as migration and security that need to be addressed: \"We need to resolve these problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear.\"",
      "The AfD won 20.8% of the vote nationally, and as the light blue areas of the map show, it was dominant in the five states in the east, securing 34%.",
      "\"East Germans have made it very clear they no longer want a firewall,\" said Tino Chrupalla.",
      "Friedrich Merz will now go into talks on forming a government with the Social Democrats, who came third.",

      "Voters have not been put off by the fact that Germany's domestic intelligence classifies parts of the AfD as right-wing extremist - or that the party has now embraced a policy called \"remigration\".",
      "The AfD argues that remigration means deporting immigrants convicted of crime, but the term has been used by the extreme right to mean mass deportations.",
      "One of the big issues for the Christian Democrats is how to get their voters back and stop losing more.",
      "Merz has already flirted with the AfD in parliament, relying on their votes to push through a motion on migration.",

      "Germany's chancellor-in-waiting is unlikely to try that again, especially if he forms a government with the centre-left.",
      "But now the AfD has more than 150 seats in parliament, its supporters in particular believe it is time for the firewall to go.",

    "summary": "Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud in a plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property.",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal charge accusing her of concocting a brazen plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property before a judge halted the mysterious foreclosure sale.",
      "During a hearing in front of a Memphis federal judge, Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She previously pleaded not guilty to the two-count indictment, which also includes a count of aggravated identity theft that will now be dropped.",
      "When asked by the judge if Findley was admitting guilt and accepting responsibility, she said \"Yes.\" Findley will be sentenced on June 19. She would have faced up to 20 years if convicted, but she is expected to receive less than that under the plea deal.",
      "\"We are grateful for the hard work of the federal investigators and prosecutors who secured this conviction,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. \"Graceland matters so much to so many people around the world \u2013 just go to Memphis during Elvis Week and listen to all the different accents and languages of fans who make the pilgrimage. All of Tennessee is glad that Graceland remains safely in the possession of Elvis's heir and that it will remain a celebrated Memphis landmark for generations to come.\"",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan\u00a0before her death in January 2023, prosecutors alleged when she was\u00a0charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents, and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "In May, a public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owes $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.",
      "Keough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending \u2014 the bogus lender authorities say Findley created \u2014 said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough's lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.",
      "Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate's lawsuit. The judge said the notary's affidavit brings into question \"the authenticity of the signature.\"",
      "The judge halted the foreclosure sale of the beloved Memphis tourist attraction, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing that a company's attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.",
      "Elvis bought Graceland in 1957 and died there in 1977, and about five years later, the mansion was opened to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the 17,552-square-foot mansion each year, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Visitors can then stop at the large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street.",
      "Elvis and other members of the Presley family, including Lisa Marie Presley and her son, Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide in 2020, are buried on the mansion's grounds.",
      "Keough, who starred in the television series hit \"Daisy Jones and The Six,\" said in a 2024 interview\u00a0with CBS News that she plans to continue running the beloved property and keep the mansion in the family. Keough and her husband Ben Smith-Peterson have a\u00a0daughter, Tupelo,\u00a0who is Elvis' first great-grandchild.",
      "\"I think, like, my instinct with everything is always to do what my mother would have wanted. Which is to keep it a home,\" Keough told CBS News last year. \"It was our family's home.\"",

      "Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose intimate vocal and musical style on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song,\" \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday, her publicist confirmed to CBS News. She was 88.",
      "She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.",
      "\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"",
      "In 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.",
      "She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.",
      "For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges \u2014 for which she was acquitted \u2014 for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, \"Free to Be ... You and Me.\"",
      "Roberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.",
      "Flack's other hits from the 1970s included the cozy \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\" \u2014 a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "\"We were deeply connected creatively,\" Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling \"Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway\" album. \"He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I'd had before or since.\"",
      "She never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of \"Killing Me Softly,\" which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.",
      "Overall, she won five Grammys (three for \"Killing Me Softly\"), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.",
      "\"I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it's our language,\" Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. \"Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling. No matter what challenge life presents, I am at home with my piano, on a stage, with my band, in the studio, listening to music. I can find my way when I hear music.\"",
      "In 2022, Beyonc\u00e9 placed Flack, Franklin and Diana Ross among others in a special pantheon of heroines name-checked in the Grammy-nominated \"Queens Remix\" of \"Break My Soul.\"",
      "Flack was briefly married to Stephen Novosel, an interracial relationship that led to tension with each of their families, and earlier had a son, the singer and keyboardist Bernard Wright. For years, she lived in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building, on the same floor as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who became a close friend and provided liner notes for a Flack album of Beatles covers, \"Let It Be Roberta.\" She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music, based in New York and attended mostly by students between ages 6 to 14.",
      "Flack had taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools for several years in her 20s, while performing after hours in clubs. She sometimes backed other singers, but her own shows at Washington's renowned Mr. Henry's attracted such celebrity patrons as Burt Bacharach, Ramsey Lewis and Johnny Mathis. The club's owner, Henry Yaffe, converted an apartment directly above into a private studio, the Roberta Flack Room.",
      "\"I wanted to be successful, a serious all-round musician,\" she told The Telegraph in 2015. \"I listened to a lot of Aretha, the Drifters, trying to do some of that myself, playing, teaching.\"",
      "Flack was signed to Atlantic Records and her debut album, \"First Take,\" a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz, came out in 1969. One track was a love song by the English folk artist Ewan MacColl: \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written in 1957 for his future wife, singer Peggy Seeger. Flack not only knew of the ballad, but used it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "\"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, D.C. It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. (Flack starts singing a Supremes hit) 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\" she told the Tampa Bay Times in 2012.",
      "\"You have to do all sorts of things when you're dealing with kids in the inner-city,\" she said. \"I knew they'd like the part where ('The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face') goes 'The first time ever I kissed your mouth.' Ooh, 'Kissed your mouth!' Once the kids got past the giggles, we were good.\"",

      "\"Beyond the Gates\" focuses on the Dupree family, a prominent Black family living in a gated community outside Washington, D.C. Leading the cast are actors Clifton Davis and Tamara Tunie with Daphn\u00e9e Duplaix and Karla Mosley portraying their daughters.",
      "\"It's fresh, it's innovative, it's exciting,\" Duplaix said during production in December.",
      "\"This is 2025,\" added Tunie. \"The writers came out swinging. The first episode is just like 'Pfooom!'\"",
      "Those writers are making their own history with the show.",
      "\"It appears to be that we're the first Black female executive producers in all of daytime drama,\" said Sheila Ducksworth, an executive producer and president of this CBS/NAACP production.",
      "Ducksworth partnered with Michele Val Jean, who serves as executive producer, head writer and showrunner.",
      "\"I'd say it's been a couple of decades in the making that I've wanted to actually produce and make a soap opera,\" Ducksworth said. \"But what I felt was missing was one that centered on the Black experience.\"",
      "Val Jean shared a similar vision: \"I just wanted to see people that looked like me. I didn't want downtrodden Black people. I wanted rich, messy Black people that carry the stories.\"",
      "That inclusive approach extends behind the camera.",
      "\"I look around, and I see African American cameramen. I see the costumers, and lighting, and crew,\" Davis said.",
      "\"The writers, the makeup, the hair,\" Duplaix added.",
      "During a December filming, a crew of more than 200 people worked around the clock to bring the show to life. Hair designer Wankaya Hinkson emphasized the importance of representation in the production.",
      "\"Bringing the culture to daytime television was very important to me,\" Hinkson said. \"I want everyone to be able to identify themselves on daytime television.\"",
      "Historically, hair and makeup departments often lacked people who knew how to work with actors of color, but \"Beyond the Gates\" has prioritized expertise in this area.",
      "\"We wear our hair many, many different ways,\" Hinkson explained. \"It's a part of our Black girl magic. I wanted to make sure that I had different textures.\"",
      "The creators, cast and crew aim to deliver the dramatic storytelling that soap operas are known for while making content that resonates with everyone.",
      "When asked how she hopes audiences will react, Tunie said, \"I hope they fall in love. I hope they fall head over heels in love with everybody in the show, with all of the perfection, flaws, humanness, and all of it.\"",

    "title": "Behind the scenes of \"Survivor\" Season 48",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 10:09:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The game is simple: can one player outwit, outplay and outlast 17 others isolated on a South Pacific island to win the $1 million prize? \"Sunday Morning\" travels to Fiji to go behind-the-scenes of a pioneer of reality TV with host Jeff Probst.",
    "story": [
      "Divide 18 strangers into three \"tribes\"; drop them on remote islands with little food and no shelter, and have them outwit and outplay one another until the last competitor standing is crowned the winner of a $1 million prize. When the adventure reality game show \"Survivor\" debuted on CBS in May 2000, nothing like it had been seen on American television before.",
      "Asked to describe the series, \"Survivor\" host and showrunner Jeff Probst said, \"It is a social experiment, in that it takes a group of people who don't know each other, and forces them to rely on each other, while playing this game where you vote each other out.\"",
      "Probst invited \"Sunday Morning\" to watch this experiment for ourselves, in Fiji, as he began taping Season 48, which premieres on CBS and Paramount+ this Wednesday.",
      "Asked if he still gets nervous hosting the series for the 48th time, Probst replied, \"I don't get nervous on 'Survivor.' It's weird. I've never gotten nervous. I lean into it. I love the uncertainty.\"",
      "And it's this uncertainty that's made \"Survivor\" one of the most popular shows on television for a quarter of a century. The show averages around 6 million viewers an episode. In the past 24 years, fans have collectively watched ten-and-a-half billion hours.",
      "\"When I knew 'Survivor' was going to be interesting was the first day of the first season,\" said Probst, \"when we abandoned everybody on the beach, and Richard Hatch \u2013 who ended up winning the first season \u2013 got up in a power position in a tree. And he was looking down on everyone, and he said, 'I think we should all talk!'\u00a0 And Sue Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin, looked up and said, 'Where I'm from, we work while we talk.'\"",
      "While Probst had no doubt, \"Survivor\" almost didn't happen. Mark Burnett, the British TV producer behind hits like \"The Apprentice\" and \"Shark Tank\" (and now President Trump's newly-appointed special envoy to the United Kingdom), re-imagined a Swedish reality series (\"Expedition: Robinson\") and took his idea to just about every U.S. TV network.",
      "\"And every network said, 'No. That's a crazy idea. We don't wanna do it,'\" said Probst. \"But Mark is not easily deterred. So, he went out and got sponsors for the entire show.\"",
      "At the time, Probst hosted music shows on cable TV (including VH1's \"Rock & Roll Jeopardy!\"). \"I was literally the last person hired,\" he said. \"I heard Mark talking about 'Survivor' on a radio interview. And he described the show. I knew when I heard it; I told all my friends, 'This is my show, this is what I've been waiting for.'\"",
      "Today, Probst (now also the showrunner) has his hands in every aspect of production, including combing through more than 15,000 audition tapes that arrive each year. \"I know within 30 seconds, honestly, within 30 seconds, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be on the show or not,\" he said. \"Some people are compelling immediately.\"",
      "People like Stephanie Berger, a technical product manager from New York City, and one of this season's chosen ones. Asked in Fiji what her strategy for the game will be, Berger replied, \"In my, like, day-to-day life, everyone will tell you that I get to be the alpha, like, I like to be in charge. I like control. And I know that I cannot come out here and do that.\"",
      "Kyle Fraser is a contestant from Roanoke, Virginia. \"When I first started watching 'Survivor,' I knew that this game was for me,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Are you willing to lie? Like, where do you draw the line in your game?\"",
      "\"Listen, I am gonna have to lie,\" Fraser said. \"You know, I'm not gonna tell people I'm a lawyer.\"",
      "Contestants not only need to build trust through any means possible; they have to win mental and physical challenges from the moment they arrive, or risk getting voted off.",
      "Probst says what we see is never staged or scripted, including tribal councils, where he grills contestants off-the-cuff, a skill he's developed over time.",
      "I said, \"You're a student of psychology and anthropology.\"",
      "\"Without the degrees!\" Probst laughed. \"I've always loved all of that. I just never formally applied it. I didn't want to be a psychologist; I wanted to be a storyteller.\"",
      "What does make it on television is carefully selected from thousands of hours worth of video shot around the clock for 26 days, in what is one of the largest television productions on Earth. \"It's a great trick, because when you're watching 'Survivor' it does feel intimate, and it is,\" Probst said. \"When the tribes are on the beaches, there's just a small handful of crew there and producers. But when you get to a challenge or tribal council, you know, there's cameras everywhere. We have roughly 400 people that are our international crew. Then we have another 400 Fijians who work with us as well. So, we're close to 1,000 people.\"",
      "Each season films in the summer, with crews arriving months in advance, turning a resort into a production village.",
      "Roberta Limjap, who works in the art department, said, \"It's not only work, it's family.\"",
      "All of the materials, equipment and props are produced here. \"Everything is made from scratch,\" she said. \"You can't buy this.\"",
      "Dozens of young production assistants test every detail of the challenges while crews plot camera angles.",
      "I had my chance. And yes, it's much harder than it looks. And tribal members often compete exhausted and hungry. They are not fed when the cameras are off.",
      "I tried my hand at survival. Opening up a coconut is not easy. \"You know what I'm afraid of? Taking off my thumb,\" I laughed.",
      "Co-executive producer Jimmy Quigley coached me through starting a fire, while on my first try with a spear gun, I caught a fish. Beginner's luck!",
      "What isn't luck is \"Survivor\"'s staying power. \"That freedom to play is what keeps us out here in the middle of Fiji,\" said Probst, who \u2013 after 47 seasons \u2013 is the ultimate survivor.",
      "\"It sounds like you're in this until the end?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm in it now,\" Probst replied. \"I don't have any thoughts of not being in it. But I mean, yeah, if you're saying at 86, I mean, maybe I'm too old then! But I never really look at it that way. I feel like I'm a part of a team. And I've said to the people I work with, 'As long as you all keep showing up, I'll keep showin' up.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 09:26:10 -0500",
    "summary": "With 18 galleries around the globe, he's been called \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\" Larry Gagosian talks about his estimated billion-dollar-a-year business and why, at age 79, he's still energized by the hustle.",
    "story": [
      "On any night, he can have art openings in Paris, in London, or at his flagship gallery in New York. With 18 galleries around the globe, Larry Gagosian has more exhibition space than most museums. His annual revenues are estimated at over a billion dollars, which (as The New Yorker put it) may make Gagosian \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\"",
      "In 2022, when Andy Warhol's \"Shot Sage Blue Marilyn\" set an auction record for a 20th century artist at Christie's, the winning bidder was Larry Gagosian. The final price, with fees: $195 million.",
      "I asked, \"That must have been a crazy moment?\"",
      "\"When you're bidding at that level,\" Gagosian said, \"your adrenaline is \u2026 it's very exciting.\"",
      "\"It's a brutal business.\"",
      "\"It's a blood sport.\"",
      "\"What do you love about this most?\" I asked.",
      "\"I love the challenge,\" Gagosian smiled. \"I love winning.\"",
      "Gagosian represents more than 100 artists, and shows the works of Picasso, Warhol, and de Kooning. His clients include billionaire mega-collectors like New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, music mogul David Geffen, and cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder. Gagosian said, \"That's why New York is such a great city for an art dealer, because you have all these super-competitive rich guys trying to (you know, in a certain way) outdo each other \u2013 'I got one.' 'Oh, I got one better.'\"",
      "Gagosian, who grew up in an Armenian family in Los Angeles, never had any formal art training. In the 1970s, he was working as a parking attendant. Then he saw somebody selling posters on the street. \"I saw that and I said, 'Jeez, I could do that.' And so, I bought basically the same posters, I literally paid a dollar apiece, and then put a little aluminum frame on them and put 'em on a peg board and tried to get as close to twenty bucks as I could, which is a pretty good profit margin.\"",
      "He built it into a business, and started having shows. In 1981, a young New York artist caught his eye: Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gagosian bought three of his paintings on the spot. \"And sadly, I sold them all. Wish I still owned them!\"",
      "He'd give Basquiat his first West Coast exhibition, which put Gagosian's gallery on the map. \"It was a big deal in L.A.,\" he said. \"We did the show and it was, like, mobbed. The buzz was \u2013 I'd never experienced anything like that in my gallery.\"",
      "But Gagosian knew that New York was the center of the art world, and in 1985, he relocated.",
      "How was he received in the New York art world? \"They didn't like me,\" he said. \"I guess they thought I was gonna, you know, cause some trouble.\"",
      "\"Well, you kinda did!\" I said.",
      "\"I'd rather not go into that litany, but I was roughed up quite a bit by competitors, I think very unfairly.\"",
      "He earned a nickname, \"Gogo,\" which he says actually started when he was young. \"When I was kid, my friends had a hard time pronouncing my name, Gagosian. And that's really where it started. But then it became, people associate it with something else.\"",
      "But Gagosian made an important ally, the esteemed dealer Leo Castelli. On a walk together one day, Castelli stopped a non-descript man in the street: \"And so I said, 'Well, who was that?' 'Oh, that's Si Newhouse.' And I'll never forget his very words: 'He can buy anything.'\"",
      "Newhouse, who owned the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, would become Gagosian's first big client. At Sotheby's 1988 auction of Jasper Johns' painting \"False Start,\" they sat side-by-side: \"He didn't want to be seen bidding,\" said Gagosian. \"So, he would literally nudge me when he wanted to bid. And I bid, I think it was $17 million. And he got the painting.\"",
      "It was a record for a living artist at the time. \"It was, you know, like, jaw-dropping,\" Gagosian said.",
      "But that price seems almost quaint today.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think there's a billion-dollar painting out there?\"",
      "\"Maybe; I don't see why not,\" Gagosian replied. \"A young artist, if he's really talented, can sell for a million dollars.\"",
      "I asked Gagosian about the comments of one of his former rivals, Arne Glimcher of Pace Gallery, who said five years ago, \"This market has nothing to do with art. It's all about how fast one can make money.\"",
      "\"You know, there's a certain truth to what he's saying,\" Gagosian said, \"but I don't think it's just about money at all. I don't think, if people didn't love art, you know, I think they wouldn't buy it at that level. I don't think it's just an asset class. And it's not just about money. It's just gotten more expensive to buy really great art.\"",
      "\"Do you think in any way it distances ordinary people from loving art?\"",
      "\"No. I think it actually makes art seem more interesting. Wow! Somebody spent X amount of money for a painting? Wow, that's fascinating!\"",
      "Gagosian \u2013 who's had some high-profile romances, is single, and has no children \u2013 is still energized by the hustle. \"I guess to a degree I thrive on it,\" he said. \"It gives you something to go for.\"",
      "\"Why do you thrive on it?\"",
      "\"Cause I'm tenacious. And because I like to win.\"",
      "\"What's the win for you?\"",
      "\"The win is to keep it going. The win is to survive at the top. There's no real finish line.\"",
      "But there is, of course. Gagosian turns 80 in April. And the man who GQ magazine called \"The closest thing the art world has to a Caesar,\" still has no plans of succession for his empire.",
      "So, can there be a Gagosian without Gagosian? \"I don't know; that's the question,\" he said. \"I don't want to think it's an impossibility. I think it's a serious challenge. But I'm not ready to pass the reins. I enjoy it too much.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are you ever gonna be, do you think?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Well, it kind of means you're, like, never at rest.\"",
      "\"Well, there's no time to rest, really. It's overrated!\" he laughed.",

    "summary": "As The Sims celebrates its 25th anniversary, its legacy is undeniable.",
    "story": [
      "As the year 2000 ushered in the new millennium, boy bands and pop stars dominated the music charts, and the International Space Station welcomed its first crew, while back on Earth, reality TV was forever changed by an inaugural group of castaways on the CBS show \"Survivor\" \u2014 all when more than 70% of Americans didn't own a cellphone and only half of U.S. households had a computer.",
      "Phil Salvador, library director for the Video Game History Foundation, reflected on this era of rapid technological growth.",
      "\"If you were playing especially computer games back then, you were probably playing on the family computer,\" Salvador  said.",
      "It was a time when gaming hardware was evolving, and titles like Halo and first-person shooters were on the rise. But one game development company, Maxis, was trying something different: simulation games, designed to replicate real-life activities.",
      "At the helm was legendary game designer Will Wright, who had a personal reason for exploring the genre.",
      "\"Will Wright actually lost his home in the Oakland Hills Fire in 1991, and he had to start rebuilding his life, and that became the inspiration for his idea of Dollhouse,\" Salvador said.",
      "Initially a virtual construction game, Dollhouse failed to draw much interest. But when Maxis was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1997, EA recognized the quirky potential of the game.",
      "Salvador noted that EA realized that people liked telling stories and interacting with the simulated people more than the game's original objective: to construct homes. It was around this time when EA changed the concept from Dollhouse to The Sims.",
      "The Sims spent nearly a decade in development, ultimately creating a digital space where players could control virtual beings, environments and life choices. When the game debuted in February 2000, it was unlike anything seen before.",
      "\"It is a game where you're helping people do chores around the house and use the toilet and things like that, and it's not the most immediately compelling game idea, but once people started seeing it hands-on, I think they realized there was something special happening there,\" Salvador said.",
      "Despite the competition from PlayStation 2 and Xbox, The Sims quickly became a cultural phenomenon. By 2002, it had become the best-selling PC game in history.",
      "\"It is \u2026 humbling to look back on all of the people that we've impacted,\" said Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, Technology and Central Development. \"Multiple generations of people grew up with The Sims.\"",
      "The franchise has redefined what it means to be a gamer, with women making up around 60% of the most recent game's player base. With over 500 million players, The Sims remains the largest brand in life-simulation games.",
      "Miele credits the game's successful longevity to it being an open canvas for creators to express themselves no matter their age.",
      "\"A player, whether you're 12 or 82, you can always be connected at the culture that you love through The Sims,\" Miele  said.",
      "The Sims continues to resonate with culture-makers too. This year, Grammy award winner Doja Cat joined The Sims' celebratory 25-hour livestream, as did Chappell Roan, the newly crowned best new artist who expressed interest in being Simmified, aiming to join the likes of the Black Eyed Peas and Glass Animals' Dave Bayley, who have recorded their songs in Simlish, the fictional language created for the game.",
      "\"Simlish was a brilliant, brilliant concept for The Sims, I have to say,\" said Rachel Franklin, EA's senior vice president and group general manager of lifestyle entertainment. \"What it does is it allows the player to be able to say, 'Hmm, I think they're saying this,' and allowing for choice and creativity and meaning that's directly connected to the player.\"",
      "Under Franklin's direction, The Sims 4 has become the most widely played title in the franchise, offering players unparalleled control over the customization of their Sims and their environments.",
      "\"We get stories all the time about how people, for example, they want to be an architect, and so they go and they play with building in The Sims, and that translates into, 'Hey, I was able to get my dream job as an architect because of all of that time I spent playing,'\" Franklin  said.",
      "\"There's also a lot of people that experiment with their own lives in The Sims, where some people will build a family, find what makes them happy through this cause and effect with these little people,\" she said. \"It's a safe space, and it's an optimistic universe. It's a place where, in the end, it all works out.\"",
      "As The Sims celebrates its 25th anniversary, its legacy is undeniable.",
      "\"In terms of importance, it is very close to the top of the list,\" said Salvador. \"When you think about games that really broke ground for what video games could be, you see, you know, Doom, which is the game, one of the first games that was a first-person shooter that really clicked on. You see something like Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, obviously. The Sims deserves to be in that same conversation.\"",
      "And as to why the game is still relevant, Salvador said, \"Everybody brings a little of themselves into the game. Everyone gets something a little bit different out of it, far more than what the developers ever intended. How many games can say that?\"",

      "King, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2007, made the difficult decision to stop performing after years of resistance.",
      "\"I've been singing and performing since I was like seven, so the idea that I wouldn't be able to do that didn't make sense to me,\" King said during a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"For the last few years, he's been trying to say, 'Chad, there are things going on with your body that you should be aware of.' And I wouldn't admit to it. I was telling him everything is fine.\"",
      "The physical challenges eventually became undeniable. King discovered the whole left side of his body would go weak by noon \u2014 including his vocal cords.",
      "\"I made this decision, one because physically, I just couldn't do the same thing. And then two was I didn't want my inability to tour or perform to affect Ian's dreams,\" he said.",
      "The duo \u2014 who met in college in 2005, and rose to fame with their Grammy-winning collaboration with Christina Aguilera \u2014 are navigating the transition through therapy.",
      "\"It allows us to talk to each other and listen to each other with someone there who's witnessing,\" Axel said. \"That allows each other not to get defensive, and to really speak from our hearts.\"",
      "Despite the changes, the pair remains creatively active. Axel will continue performing shows, while they're both working on adapting \"Wonder,\" the best-selling book by R. J. Palacio, for Broadway.",
      "\"'Wonder' is a show about a boy named Auggie who was born with a facial difference,\" Axel explained. \"It's about him navigating his first year in middle school. But really it's a show about kindness and empathy and courage.\"",
      "Meanwhile, King sees his openness about multiple sclerosis\u00a0as an opportunity to help others.",

    "story": [
      "On a sprawling farm in Connecticut, Bill Berloni has spent nearly five decades turning rescue dogs into stars of stage and screen. The Tony Award-winning animal trainer has worked with between 200-300 dogs since 1976, all of them rescued from shelters.",
      "\"Someone told me they had cheap dogs at the animal shelter and I went looking one day,\" Berloni recalls of his first theatrical dog training experience. \"I found this little dog who was gonna be put to sleep the next day, adopted him and that was the original production of \"Annie\" and that was the original Sandy.\"",
      "That chance beginning launched a remarkable career. Berloni became the first trainer to feature a dog in a major role on Broadway, and remains the only animal trainer to receive a Tony Award for Excellence in Theater.",
      "His current roster of performers includes Bowdie, who starred as Nana in \"Peter Pan Live,\" and Myrtle, who plays Charlotte York's dog in \"And Just Like That ...\" One of his newest stars, Tana June, was rescued just four months before landing a role alongside six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald in Broadway's \"Gypsy.\"",
      "\"These are the original method actors because you're on stage and they're in the moment,\" Berloni said.",
      "The trainer and his team prepare the dogs extensively for live theater's unpredictable environment.",
      "\"We prepare them by taking them to shows ahead of time. We desensitize them to the things they're gonna be in touch with,\" he explains.",
      "For Berloni, working exclusively with rescue animals is a moral imperative.",
      "\"My answer is why not? And as a result, two to 300 animals have lived wonderful lives who might not have been alive,\" he says.",
      "When their performing days are over, all of Berloni's dogs retire to his farm.",
      "\"The thought of adopting a dog, exploiting it for money and then getting rid of it just didn't make any sense to me,\" he explains.",

    "summary": "Amazon MGM Studios and longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights.",
    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:33:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Arline Geronimus' research shows how societal pressures like institutional racism, classism, financial stressors or the environmental can impact not just the length of life, but also the quality of life for marginalized communities suffering chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years ago, the public was outraged.\u00a0 It seemed there was a wave of teenage girls, particularly Black teenage girls, getting pregnant. \"This was a new idea, this new deviant class of people, and it was portrayed in these terms that were really not accurate: babies having babies,\" said Arline Geronimus.",
      "Geronimus was at the time a graduate student.\u00a0 The prevailing wisdom was that high rates of infant mortality in the Black community were because women were having children when they were too young. \"I had worked in a school for pregnant teens. And none of what I was hearing, and had taken as common sense myself, was what I was seeing,\" she said.",
      "Geronimus looked at the numbers and found that, actually, younger mothers were having more successful pregnancies. She said, \"For the Black women, the lowest risk ages were in the teens and the late teens. And then they went straight up, so that by the 20s, and certainly by the mid-to-late 20s, there was substantially more risk of infant mortality if you had a baby, compared to if you were 18 or 19. And by 35, things were off the charts.\"",
      "How did people react to what she found? \"Not very well!\" Geronimus said. \"People thought I was promoting teen childbearing. The papers wrote columns where they called it things like, 'Research Queen Says Let Them Have Babies.'\u00a0 I got death threats.\"",
      "Geronimus became a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, where she teaches to this day. She lowered her profile, but also widened her perspective, examining indicators like the lower life expectancy of Black Americans (72.8 years) compared to white Americans (77.5).",
      "She developed a theory: that stress caused by racism and other societal pressures contributes to poor health. She named it \"Weathering.\"",
      "\"The idea of weathering was connoting sort of how a rock, for example, would be weathered by hundreds of years of rain and wind,\" she said. \"It's gonna affect it [and] absolutely wear it down. I like the word weathering in particular, because it also has another meaning, which is that you weather the storm.\"",
      "The weathering theory deals with not just length of life, but quality of life. For example, while on average Black women outlive white men (76.5 years versus 75.1), Geronimus found that Black women faced shorter active life expectancies (59 years) than white men (64) \u2013 that is, Black women become disabled at earlier ages.",
      "After decades of working on the theory, she pulled it all together in a book called, \"Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society\" (Little, Brown Spark).\u00a0 She defines weathering as the way that structural racism makes life very hard. But there are a lot of different factors. \"This is not something that just affects people of color; it can be a class issue as well?\" I asked.",
      "Geronimus said, \"It can be a class issue, it can be a stigmatized group issue; anybody who's human is capable of becoming weathered, and will become weathered to some degree, if they're also oppressed or marginalized or suffering endless stressors, whether it's environmental or material hardships or hunger, or whether it's the fact that you're not affirmed or valued, and you have to question where you belong, and what it's safe to do or say in different situations.\"",
      "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom has spent much of her career putting Geronimus' theories into practice, trying to overcome the impacts of weathering: \"She endured a lot for this work. And we just have to applaud her. Her courage is remarkable.\"",
      "Wisdom is the senior vice president of community health and equity at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. She also served as Michigan's first surgeon general.",
      "She notes how day-to-day stress actually changes the body down to the cellular level, leading to premature aging. \"The body keeps score,\" she said. \"So, take diabetes, take hypertension, take cardiovascular disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality \u2013 just multiply the poor outcome by two or by three, and that's what you see in the populations of color. So, it's like the Caucasian population can catch a cold, but populations of color actually develop pneumonia.\"",
      "For example, the latest studies show infant mortality rates for Black Americans that are more than double those of white Americans (10.9 versus 4.52).",
      "To take on the challenge, Dr. Wisdom founded the WIN Network, which stands for the Women-Inspired Neighborhood Network. Expectant mothers are given health care, guidance and support through pregnancy and beyond, which has led to maternal and infant deaths falling, and birthweights rising.",
      "Courtney Anderson said the experience of having her third child, Kalani, through WIN was great. \"She's a happy baby. Most happiest baby I got,\" Anderson said.",
      "Anderson had her first child, Kamrine, before she was in the WIN Network. He was followed a year later by his brother, Kristian. \"With my first child \u2026 I had my hands full, kind of stressed. Kind of bummed out. Post-partum depression.\" But she says the support she received through WIN was a major improvement, increasing her happiness, which in turn has impacted her children positively. \"It's going to affect them really well to know that their mom's happy,\" Anderson said. \"When mom is happy, they get it, and they have a lot more.\"",
      "I asked Wisdom, \"What would you say to people who would kind of maybe blow this off and say, 'Everybody has stress, everybody has things to deal with, what's the big deal? Take care of it yourself. Be responsible for your own health'?\"",
      "\"Yes, people should eat healthy, have healthy behaviors, but yet we see the weathering, when we look through the lens of what's really happening in a society,\" Wisdom replied. \"You can do all those things and have a poor outcome. See, the typical narrative is you eat healthy, you go to school, you get a college degree, you have a good life and you live to 80 or 90.\u00a0 That happens with one population. When you find another population that eats healthy, goes to college, gets an education, gets her Ph.D., and dies of maternal mortality, something is wrong.\"",
      "When asked if the concept of \"weathering\" could be seen as another way of making Black people into victims, or building in another stereotype, Geronimus said, \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. Even if you go back to slavery, no one was working harder, or doing more. But the people who pronounce on 'Black people's poverty is self-inflicted 'cause they're too lazy or too irresponsible,' they're just wrong.\"",
      "At the end of the day, it got me thinking about my own family.\u00a0 My parents died in their 70s. Two siblings died in their early 60s \u2026 all of them much too soon.\u00a0 There were certain ailments \u2013 diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure \u2013 that were expected almost, or that just kind of comes with the territory. And Wisdom says it shouldn't come with the territory \u2013 or that the reason it came with the territory was due to weathering.",
      "Wisdom said, \"Many people of color, families say that, 'Oh, we all get diabetes. We all get cancer. I mean, that's part of the natural course of life. That's the life course.' That is not the life course.\"",

      "The FDA's announcement comes months after drugmaker Novo Nordisk told the agency that all dosages of its semaglutide product had become fully available nationwide. The company said in a statement that it confirms the supply of the medications, which are prescription-only, \"now meets or exceeds both current and projected U.S. demand.\"",
      "\"This update comes after ongoing dialogue with the FDA, and substantial efforts by Novo Nordisk to increase manufacturing capacity, including $6.5 billion dollars of investments in the U.S. this year alone,\" the drugmaker said.",
      "The FDA said that it will allow compounding pharmacies to continue to make copies of semaglutide for now, which they are usually allowed to do only while the drug is in shortage.",
      "That leeway will continue until April 22 for many pharmacies and May 22 for outsourcing facilities to \"avoid unnecessary disruption\" to patients, the agency said.",
      "This is similar to what the FDA has granted compounding pharmacies making copies of Eli Lilly's diabetes and weight loss drug tirzepatide, amid an ongoing lawsuit brought by outsourcing facilities disputing the FDA's decision to declare the shortage of that weight loss drug over.",
      "Some compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities have made millions making copies of semaglutide and tirzepatide during their shortages in recent years, amid a flurry of companies cashing in on demand for the drugs.",
      "The FDA is also facing calls to do more to crack down on counterfeits of the drugs, including from state attorneys general who urged the agency this week to stop illegal imports from overseas.",
      "\"Demand for the medications Mounjaro, Zepbound, Ozempic, and Wegovy (GLP-1 drugs) has skyrocketed, but supply shortages and high costs have created opportunities for wrongdoers to cash in and endanger consumers,\" they wrote.",

    "story": [
      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration were fired this month as part of the government-wide cuts to recently hired federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force.",
      "The cuts amounted to around 100 probationary workers, multiple current and former federal health officials told CBS News, and affected multiple teams around the department, ranging from recently hired directors of SAMHSA's regional offices to staff working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises, which the agency oversees.",
      "At the agency's communications team, whose work is aimed at raising awareness about the 988 hotline, a SAMHSA employee said a quarter of their team had been lost over the last month.",

      "Palosky declined a request for an interview, referring comment to SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Officials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.",
      "Much of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.",
      "That includes funding for the call centers that make up the 988 hotline, run largely by state and local governments around the country, as well as the nonprofit that administers it.",
      "Federal health officials said they also feared the cuts at the agency would herald a return of the plummeting morale under the first Trump administration, which followed a steep reduction in the agency's size.",
      "The workforce at SAMHSA dropped to a low of 376 employees in 2020, according to records tallied by the Partnership for Public Service, down from a high of 553 in 2014.",
      "Over the same time, survey scores of employee satisfaction at SAMHSA dropped to a record low of 27 out of 100, far below the average for federal agencies.",
      "Employee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.",
      "Most federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.",
      "Agencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.",
      "Some agencies initially slated for steep cuts later secured exemptions for many health agency workers, including the Indian Health Service.",
      "It is not clear how many total workers were ultimately cut from HHS.",
      "At SAMHSA, officials remaining at the agency said the firings were frustrating, undoing hard-won hires in some cases for needed positions.",
      "One health official warned of a repeat from the \"doom loop\" that plagued the agency during the first Trump administration, where most of the highest performing workers fled SAMHSA for jobs in the private sector, feeding a drop in morale.",
      "Some staff remained because they were committed to public service, the official said. But many others remained because they were stuck in their jobs at SAMHSA, either because of personal circumstances or because they were unable to get hired elsewhere.",

    "story": [
      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "DEI, aimed at promoting fairness in the workplace and opening career paths for people of color, women and other protected classes,\u00a0gained momentum\u00a0after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",

    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations.

      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",

An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend.

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long been Tesla's public face, convincing consumers to pay premium prices for electric vehicles that promised to help combat climate change. But as Musk has navigated toward conservative politics and emerged as a close adviser to President Trump, some Tesla owners say they are reconsidering their loyalty to the brand.",
      "Wall Street analysts worry the Tesla brand is showing some cracks, with sales falling 1% in 2024 from the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years, even as global EV sales rose 7.3%. They also say Musk's political activities risk alienating consumers, while protests have erupted at a number of\u00a0Tesla dealerships across the U.S. over his proximity to the Trump administration.",
      "\"It would seem that potential consumers for Tesla EVs might be turning away from the company because they don't appreciate Elon Musk's close relationship to President Trump and the administration's tariff policies,\" Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the carmaker's stock has dropped 17% due to the \"visible perceived downside impact\" of Musk's involvement with the White House, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Feb. 19 research note.",
      "The inextricable link between Musk, the world's richest person, and Tesla's brand illustrates both the opportunities and risks of tying a company's fortunes to the personality of a single executive. Musk has led Tesla from its days as a scrappy startup to the world's biggest producer of EVs, growing its valuation to more than $1.2 trillion, making it one of the world's most valuable businesses.",
      "But Musk's recent\u00a0inflammatory public statements\u00a0and his role leading Mr. Trump's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, appear to be turning off some Americans. Consumers' political leanings can play into their decision to buy an electric vehicle, with Democrats three times more likely to buy an EV than Republicans, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of Musk's political activities on the automaker.",
      "Customer dissatisfaction",
      "Among the one-time Tesla fans who have had second thoughts is Minah Oh, 40, of Massachusetts, who told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's political activities led her to sell her Tesla Model X, which she had owned since 2015, in October.",
      "\"I got it because it was great for the environment, and at the time he was more on the liberal side of politics,\" Oh told CBS MoneyWatch about Musk. But, she added, she felt that Musk by last fall had become \"volatile and turned radically right.\"",
      "Oh also said she was concerned that driving a Tesla could signal to others that she's aligned with Musk's political opinions.",
      "\"I wouldn't want people to think I was a Trumper or that I am associated with Elon, because he is so tied to the brand,\" Oh said. \"I am so happy I sold it, because if I was driving it today, in the current climate I would be so embarrassed.\"",
      "Jake Nickell is another former Tesla owner who has distanced himself from the car company because of Musk's evolving reputation. An early EV fan, the Chicago-based entrepreneur bought the first of three Tesla vehicles he eventually purchased, a Roadster sportscar, in 2006.",
      "\"It was super fun to see an electric car company come up and be viable,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. He sold the car for a profit when it was no longer practical for his growing family, replacing it with a Tesla Model S and later a Model X.",
      "But Nickell said he sold the Model X in 2021 because he was unhappy with the vehicle and because of Musk's changing public persona. He replaced it with a car from rival EV maker Rivian.",
      "\"We were not happy with how [Musk] was acting on many levels. It was a slow slide. He started getting into the 'bro' startup culture of cryptocurrency at time, and there were signs that he was sliding into right-wing politics. We didn't want anything to do with that anymore,\" Nickell said of why he sold his family's Model X.",
      "Asked if he'd ever buy a Tesla again, Nickell responded, \"Absolutely not.\" He's now helping his son buy a car and is considering a Toyota Prius or an EV from Volkswagen.",
      "Musician Sheryl Crow is another former Tesla owner who recently distanced herself from the brand, writing in an Instagram\u00a0post\u00a0that she sold her vehicle because of Musk's recent political activities.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" she wrote, adding that she was donating the proceeds of the sale to NPR because the Trump administration wants to cut its federal funding.",
      "Wall Street analysts have voiced concern about the impact of Musk's reputation on the company's sales. That includes in Europe, where Tesla sales in Germany, a key market, fell roughly 60% last month, according to Reuters.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" Ives, who remains bullish on the company's prospects, said in his Feb. 19 report. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November.\"",
      "Tesla's \"net favorability rating,\" which measures consumers' perception of the brand based on survey responses, is at all-time lows, according to Stephen Gengaro, an analyst for investment advisory firm Stifel, who believes that Musk could be hurting the brand's score. Researchers asked consumers if they had a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" impression of Tesla, ranging from \"very favorable\" to \"very unfavorable,\" to determine the rating. Respondents could also reply that they'd never heard of the brand, or that they had no opinion.",
      "Tesla's favorability rating sank to 3%, a six percentage point decline, for the week ended Jan. 28, compared with 9% in January 2024, according to data from Stifel Think Tank Group, the firm's research and analysis arm. In January 2018, the company's favorability rating stood at 33%.",
      "\"[M]any on the Street view Musk spending '100% of his time' with DOGE as creating a negative perception around his Tesla focus,\" Gengaro wrote in a research note.",
      "Partisan divide",
      "More than half of Americans held a negative view of Musk, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2. Views were starkly divided based on political party, with about 7 in 10 Republicans saying they had a favorable view of him, while more than 8 in 10 Democrats said they viewed him unfavorably.",
      "Those changing perceptions may be rubbing off on car buyers, with a February Morning Consult poll finding that about 32% of U.S. buyers \"would not consider\" buying a Tesla, a five percentage point increase compared with a year earlier, according to a recent CNN report.",
      "In states that voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections, the share of repeat Tesla buyers dropped seven percentage points over the past year, falling from 72% at the end of 2023 to 65% by the fourth quarter of 2024, according to additional data provided to CNN by S&P Global Mobility. Repeat buyers in states that voted Republican barely inched higher, rising from 47.6% to 48.2% over the same period.",
      "In California, the country's largest market for electric vehicles, total driver registrations for Tesla's cars fell 11.6% percent in 2024, according to data from Experian automotive. Registrations for all other brands increased 1.4%, California New Car Dealers Association NCDA wrote in a January\u00a0report.",
      "Could Musk's ties to Trump actually help Tesla?",
      "At the same time, some on Wall Street say there are potential upsides to Musk's alliance with Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, the Trump administration may seek to weaken or eliminate federal rules governing Tesla's self-driving vehicle technology, a major initiative for Tesla.",
      "Musk has long had ambitions to launch full self-driving vehicles powered by AI. The company plans to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June, Musk\u00a0confirmed. Yet such efforts have been slowed by federal investigations into vehicle crashes involving Tesla's\u00a0\"Full Self-Driving\" system and by existing safety regulations.",
      "\"Trump's election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that's been stifling Tesla,\" Ives told the Associated Press.",
      "If the Trump administration eases regulations for self-driving cars, it would be \"a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the dip in consumer perceptions of Tesla's brand could simply be a short-term headwind, Gengaro said. And long-term, the company's development of robotaxis and self-driving vehicles could provide much more of Tesla's growth than vehicle sales to consumers, he added.",
      "Tesla's sales struggles also could be based on other issues besides Musk, including mounting competition for EVs from other automakers. And Tesla's sales decline in Germany could be due to a preference among consumers there for electric cars made by homegrown automakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.",

      "Tips for saving on soaring costs",
      "Experts say the costs of raising chickens can quickly add up. A backyard hen in her prime can lay up to five eggs per week, but consumers need to consider the initial cost of the coop, chicks and feed, which could cost thousands of dollars. Meanwhile if you bought a dozen eggs per week at the grocery store, it would be about $300 per year.",
      "\"I always say that they're not just PEZ dispensers,\" Mormino said. \"So how many eggs they lay a week is going to depend on how healthy they are, how young they are, what the seasonal influences are.\"",

      "\"Bird flu is distributed primarily by migratory waterfowl so they're droppings and other secretions are infected by the virus,\" Mormino explained. \"All you have to do is walk through duck poop at a pond in the local park and now you're carrying bird flu on your shoes, wherever you're going.\"",

      "Tax experts say these concerns are valid and that it's more important than ever to file early this year, as Americans could encounter tax refund delays, particularly as they get closer to the filing deadline. The Internal Revenue Service began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15, unless a taxpayer asks for an extension.",
      "Mr. Trump is\u00a0expected to fire more than 6,000\u00a0IRS employees by the end of this week, as he doubles down on efforts to cut the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Tax accountant Terrance Hutchins, of Logos Financial Group, said taxpayers should expect longer hold times over the phone and slower customer service in general. He still expends refunds on relatively straightforward returns that are filed early and electronically, though, to appear in a timely manner.",
      "But many taxpayers could experience processing delays as a result of the anticipated cuts.",
      "\"Your refund can be very fast indeed if you receive it by direct deposit, but those promises were made a few weeks ago before the agency knew of the cuts, so it's very hard to say what the impact will be,\" Vanessa Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Will the IRS cuts affect how long it takes to get my refund?",
      "Tax accountants say the advice they always give taxpayers \u2014 which is to file their returns early \u2014 is even more important this year, in light of the anticipated workforce reduction. If the IRS' headcount is reduced, any errors on one's tax return will take longer to remedy.",
      "If taxpayers file close to the deadline or make mistakes in their returns, Hutchins expects a reduced workforce at the agency would lead to one's refund being delayed.",
      "Williams of the Tax Policy Center, said filers in need of assistance should expect slower refunds as a result of long wait times and worse customer service.\u00a0 \"You spend a lot of time on hold, and there are real consequences,\" she said, recalling the 2010s when the IRS was understaffed.",
      "Democratic Senators warned in a letter to the Trump administration Tuesday that potential staff cuts could lead to delayed tax refunds for Americans in 2025.",
      "\"Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement effort,\" the senators wrote. It's essential that the agency responsible for processing refunds be fully staffed to support Americans through tax season and \"answer their questions, process their returns, send them refunds and keep IRS systems online and functional.\"",
      "\"I always advise people to do their taxes as early as they can, partly because hackers can get their social security numbers and file false tax returns,\" Katie Brewer, a Texas-based financial adviser told CBS MoneyWatch. Brewer also expects cuts to lead to longer wait times to have tax-related questions answered by phone, a particularly burdensome for older filers, who aren't as tech savvy and might not be inclined to turn to the IRS' website for advice, she added.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "The IRS says that most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days, if you file your taxes electronically. It can take longer to get a refund on paper returns.",
      "Taxpayers filing electronically can view the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund? tool.",
      "Returns that require corrections or extra review could result in a delayed refund, the IRS notes. That's why Brewer says it's extra important to ensure that there are no errors on your return.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't double check things until after they hit send. But I really encourage to make sure not to mix up any numbers or accidentally add a zero because those are the kinds of things that hinder refunds or make it hard to deal with the IRS to correct them,\" Brewer said.",
      "Who counts on timely refunds?",
      "Millions of Americans count on receiving their refunds in a timely manner, so that they can repay debt, put money into savings, or make a big purchase.",
      "\"Particularly for working families who receive a child tax credit, or the earned income tax credit, these are often essential supports for Americans,\" Williams said. \"Low-income people use their tax refunds to pay off their winter heating bills, or to put money aside to cover spring clothes for their kids.\"",
      "She added that working-class Americans rely on their tax credits for financial stability. \"That's the purpose. To give people stability when they are working and have kids,\" she said. \"It's not a spare $20 someone might be excited to receive as gift or surprise. It's real money that underwrites the economic security of a very large number of Americans.\"",
      "The IRS last year piloted a new, free electronic service called Direct File, that provides public tax preparation services. It's currently available to 30 million Americans in 25 states, and pulls one's personal tax filing information directly from the IRS. Using such a service is one way to increase one's chances of receiving a refund in a timely manner, according to Williams.",
      "Why haven't I received my tax refund yet?",
      "The IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool will tell electronic filers what the status of their 2025 tax refund is 24 hours after they file a return, according to the agency's website. Those filing by mail can view the status of their refund four weeks after they mail in their return.",
      "To use the tool, taxpayers need to enter their Social Security number, or ITIN, their filing status and exact dollar amount of their refund rounded to the nearest whole number.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks tumbled on Friday after weaker-than-expected economic reports suggested that President Trump's policies could be impacting U.S. business activity, while consumer sentiment dropped to a 15-month low.",
      "Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% on Friday, marking their worst one-day declines since December 18, according to financial data firm FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.2%.",
      "A preliminary report from S&P Global found U.S. business activity is nearing stall-speed, with growth decelerating to a 17-month low. Activity for U.S. services businesses unexpectedly shrank, and many businesses in the survey reported slumping optimism because of worries about policies from the Trump administration, including the potential for new tariffs and domestic spending cuts.",
      "\"Companies report widespread concerns about the impact of federal government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"Sales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.\"",
      "Inflation worries also weighed on the stock market, with a University of Michigan survey finding that consumers are preparing for higher inflation due to potential tariffs. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, such as retailers such as Walmart, the costs are often passed onto consumers, raising prices.",
      "Consumers say they are broadly expecting prices to be 4.3% higher 12 months from now, which is a big jump from last month's forecast of 3.3% inflation, the University of Michigan survey found. That fits with preliminary data the survey suggested earlier, though a divide is evident underneath the surface.",
      "Expectations for inflation are rising for political independents and Democrats, while falling slightly for Republicans.",
      "A third economic report, meanwhile, said sales of previously occupied homes were weaker last month than economists expected. Relatively high mortgage rates have been hurting the housing market.",
      "Walmart, Akamai",
      "Other corporate reports have added to the sense of unease on Wall Street, including Walmart's most recent earnings report. The retailing giant on Thursday provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart shares slipped 2.5% on Friday, following a 6.5% decline on the prior day.",
      "\"With policy uncertainty and weaker retail sales guidance yesterday from consumer spending bellwether Walmart, we may have the catalyst we need for a healthy correction,\" noted Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email.",
      "Akamai Technologies had the sharpest drop in the S&P 500, even though the cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger profit than analysts expected. It lost a fifth of its value and fell 20.6% as investors focused instead on its forecasts for revenue and other financial measures this upcoming year, which fell short of analysts' expectations.",
      "Even within the big companies of the S&P 500 index, roughly 4 out of every 5 stocks fell. Everything from Big Tech stocks that have been bid up amid the artificial-intelligence frenzy to airlines to metals companies fell. Nvidia sank 2.5%. United Airlines lost 5.5%, and Newmont Mining fell 4.4%.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. stock market is still up for the young year so far and is not far from its all-time high set earlier this week. Virtually no one on Wall Street is forecasting a recession anytime soon. But Friday's reports together raise concerns about what's been a remarkably resilient economy, and the ensuing losses on Wall Street were widespread.",
      "Before Friday's sharp drop, the S&P 500 had been heading for a week of almost zero movement. Helping to lift stocks had been a steady parade of better-than-expected profit reports. That worked against worries about stubbornly high inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates.",

    "summary": "A grassroots effort is asking American consumers to refrain from making purchases at major retailers for one day in February.",
    "story": [
      "Over the past few weeks, information has been spreading on social media about a nationwide economic protest called the \"Feb 28 Economic Blackout.\"",
      "The call to action \u2014 or rather inaction \u2014 is asking that American consumers refrain from making any purchases at major retailers on Friday, February 28. The protest comes as people continue to endure\u00a0rising prices on everything from food and gas to housing and utilities, epitomized by the soaring cost of eggs which in January\u00a0averaged $4.95 a dozen.",
      "Behind the boycott is a group called The People's Union USA, a self-described grassroots organization founded by John Schwarz, a 57-year-old dad originally from Queens, New York, who has been promoting the consumer blackout for weeks on social media. The People's Union says it has no political affiliation, but focuses on \"fairness, economic justice and real systemic change.\"",
      "Some postings for the event created by online supporters have suggested a targeted boycott of retailers like\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta, Target and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0that have ended their DEI programs to comply with an\u00a0executive order\u00a0signed by President Trump in January. However, official messaging from The People's Union suggests a boycott of all major retailers, with the goal of enacting broader economic change.",
      "\"For our entire lives, they have told us we have no choice ... that we have to accept these insane prices, the corporate greed, the billionaire tax breaks, all while we struggle to just to get by,\" Schwarz said in a video posted to his Instagram account. \"February 28, the 24-hour economic blackout: no Amazon, no Walmart, no fast food, no gas, not a single unnecessary dollar spent ... for one day, we are going to finally turn the tables.\"",
      "The boycott has received support from celebrities including John Leguizamo, Stephen King and Bette Midler, each of whom has posted information on the Economic Blackout on their social media accounts.",
      "Schwarz did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Why February 28?",
      "Schwarz explains on Instagram that he originally picked the Feb. 28 date to provide \"time to get amped up, to push this out there and really spread the word.\"",
      "What is the 24-hour economic blackout?",
      "According to an email circulating for the 24-hour Economic Blackout, The People's Union is urging consumers to halt all purchases, both online and in stores, from starting at 12 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 28 through 11:59 p.m. that same day.",
      "The idea is to halt spending at big corporations, Schwarz said.",
      "\"If you have automatic payments linked up to your bank account of course, we're not talking about disrupting your life,\" he said in a video. \"But do not go out and shop at any big, major store \u2014 if you have to, go to the local pizza place, the small local boutique.\"",
      "Will the Feb. 28 blackout make an impact?",
      "Consumer spending is the bedrock of the U.S. economy, contributing almost 70% of GDP, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But some critics say that halting spending for a single day isn't likely to make much impact on major retailers.",
      "\"A lot of people dismiss the idea, arguing that a one-day spending freeze won't move the needle for major corporations or the broader financial system. And I agree \u2014 it'll likely have a minimal direct impact,\" Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek.",
      "But, he added, the economic blackout could become bigger, snowballing into more events across the U.S. The People's Union is planning additional blackouts aimed at specific retailers, such as an event from March 7-14 to halt spending at Amazon.",
      "Schwarz expresses optimism in his videos that the economic blackout could make an impact. \"If a million people on the 28th do not spend a dime, you might not think out of 360 million people in this country that's a lot, but a million people all on one day not spending their money, that is a hit,\" he said.",

The facility is heavily guarded and has broken its strict policy of not allowing visitors only three times.",

Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he would happily arrange an inspection for any senator who is interested in seeing the vaults.",

    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA is already limited in policing claims of health benefits by makers of supplements and herbal remedies \u2014 a $70 billion industry. Get ready for even less regulation.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, before being named the senior U.S. health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration would liberate Americans from the FDA's \"aggressive suppression\" of vitamins, dietary supplements, and other substances \u2014 ending the federal agency's \"war on public health,\" as he put it.",
      "In fact, the FDA can't even require that supplements be effective before they are sold. When Congress, at the agency's urging, last considered legislation to require makers of vitamins, herbal remedies, and other pills and potions to show proof of their safety and worth before marketing the products, it got more negative mail, phone calls, and telegrams than at any time since the Vietnam War, by some accounts. The backlash resulted in a 1994 law that enabled the dietary supplement industry to put its products on the market without testing and to tout unproven benefits, as long as the touting doesn't include claims to treat or cure a disease. Annual industry revenues have grown from $4 billion to $70 billion since.",
      "With Kennedy now in the driver's seat, the industry will likely expect more: It aims to make bolder health claims for its products and even get the government, private insurers, and flexible spending accounts to pay for supplements, essentially putting them on an equal footing with FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.",
      "On Feb. 13, the day Kennedy was sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Services, President Donald Trump issued a \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda targeting alleged corruption in health regulatory agencies and instructing them to \"ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\"",
      "Kennedy has said exercise, dietary supplements, and nutrition, rather than pharmaceutical products, are key to good health. Supplement makers want consumers to be able to use programs like health savings accounts, Medicare, and even benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to pay for such items as vitamins, fish oil, protein powders, and probiotics.",
      "\"Essentially they're seeking a government subsidy,\" said Pieter Cohen, a Harvard University physician who studies supplements.",
      "As the Senate Finance Committee questioned Kennedy during his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing, supporters in the Alliance for Natural Health lunched on quinoa salad in a U.S. Capitol Visitor Center and crowed that the moment had finally arrived for their health freedom movement, which has combined libertarian capitalism and mistrust of the medical establishment to champion unregulated compounds since the 19th century.",
      "\"The greatest opportunity of our lifetimes is before us,\" said Jonathan Emord, the group's general counsel, who has brought many successful lawsuits against the FDA's restrictions on unproven health claims. \"RFK has dedicated his whole life to opposing the undue influence\" of the pharmaceutical industry and \"assuring that our interests triumph,\" Emord said.",
      "In speeches and in a pamphlet called \"The MAHA Mandate,\" Emord and alliance founder Robert Verkerk said Kennedy would free companies to make greater claims for their products' alleged benefits. Emord said his group was preparing to sue the FDA to prevent it from restricting non-pharmaceutical production of substances like biopeptides \u2014 complex molecules related to drugs like Ozempic.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not respond to a request for comment on the agency's plans vis-\u00e0-vis dietary supplements.",
      "While the basic law governing the FDA establishes that a substance alleged to have treatment or curative effects is by definition a \"drug,\" and therefore comes under the agency's requirements for high standards of scientific evidence, the new administration could reallocate money away from enforcement, said Mitch Zeller, former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "As a Senate aide early in his career, Zeller investigated a tainted L-tryptophan supplement that killed at least 30 people and sickened thousands in the U.S. in 1989. The scandal led the FDA to seek heavier regulation of supplements, but a powerful backlash resulted in the relatively weak supplements law of 1994.",
      "Even that law's enforcement could be undercut with a stroke of the pen that would keep FDA inspectors out of the field, Zeller said.",
      "Sweeping changes couldn't come too soon for Nathan Jones, founder and CEO of Xlear, a company that makes products containing xylitol, an artificial sweetener. The Federal Trade Commission sued Xlear in 2021 for making what it called false claims that its nasal spray could prevent and treat COVID.",
      "Jones points to a handful of studies evaluating whether xylitol prevents cavities and infections, saying the FDA would require overly expensive studies to get xylitol approved as a drug. Meanwhile, he said, dentists have been bought out by \"Big Toothpaste.\"",
      "One can hardly find any products \"without fluoride for oral health,\" he said. \"Crest and Colgate don't want it to happen,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's desire to rid water supplies of fluoride because of its alleged impact on children's IQ is welcome news, he said, and not only because it could highlight the value of his products. Jones stresses, as do many health freedom advocates, that clean air and water and unadulterated food do more to prevent and cure disease than vaccines and drugs. For example, he and other advocates claim, wrongly, that the United States eliminated the crippling disease polio through better sanitation, not vaccination.",
      "The Alliance for Natural Health hopes that in lieu of strict FDA standards, Kennedy will enable companies to make expanded marketing claims based on evidence from non-FDA sources, Verkerk said, such as the National Institutes of Health's nutritional information site, which describes the pros and cons of different supplements.",
      "Kennedy has also called for relaxing the strictures on psychedelic drugs, which interest some veterans as potential remedies for such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder. VETS, a San Diego-based organization, has paid for 1,000 veterans to get treatment with the powerful hallucinogen ibogaine at clinics in Mexico and other countries, said the group's co-founder, Amber Capone.",
      "She got involved after her husband, a retired Navy SEAL, pulled out of a suicidal spiral after spending a week at an ibogaine clinic near Tijuana, Mexico, in 2017. She wants NIH, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund research on the illegal substance \u2014 which can cause cardiac complications and is listed as a Schedule I drug, on par with heroin and LSD \u2014 so it can be made legally available when appropriate.",
      "Coincidentally, the push for less onerous standards on supplements and psychedelics would come while Kennedy is demanding \"gold-standard science\" to review preservatives and other food additives that he has said could play a role in the country's high rate of chronic diseases.",
      "\"Put aside the fact that there's precious little evidence to support\" that idea, said Stuart Pape, a former FDA food center attorney. \"There's been no indication they want the same rigor for supplements and nutraceuticals.\"",
      "Although most of these products don't have major safety concerns, \"we have no idea which products work, so in the best case people are throwing away a ton of money,\" Zeller said. \"The worst-case scenario is they are relying on unproven products to treat underlying conditions, and time is going by when they could have been using more effective FDA-authorized products for diseases.\"",
      "Supplement makers aren't entirely unified. Groups such as the Consumer Healthcare Products Association and the Council for Responsible Nutrition have advocated for the FDA to crack down on products that are unsafe or falsely represented. The Alliance for Natural Health and the Natural Products Association, meanwhile, largely want the government to get out of the way.",
      "\"The time has come to embrace a radical shift \u2014 from reactive disease management to proactive health cultivation, from top-down public health diktats to personalized, individual-centric care,\" Emord and Verkerk state in their \"MAHA Mandate.\"",

The 2024 rule made mishandling wheelchairs a violation of the federal Air Carrier Access Act.",
      "American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and United declined to comment, referring requests to Airlines for America, which issued a statement calling the new requirements unnecessary and an overreach.",
      "\"Progress has been made in four key areas aimed at improving the travel experience for passengers with mobility aids \u2014 reducing instances of wheelchair mishandling, advancing employee training and education programs, forming passenger accessibility advisory groups and supporting research for onboard accessibility solutions,\" it stated.",
      "The transportation department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In crafting\u00a0the rule, Pete Buttigieg, the then secretary of transportation, worked with disability advocates including Samantha Jade Duran, whose wheelchair was damaged by an airline in 2017 when stored with luggage in the cargo hold.",

      "Finalized in December, the rule requires that airlines offer annual training for workers who interact with disabled passengers, and that those with disabilities get prompt assistance during their travels. If a wheelchair is checked but is delayed, missing or damaged, the rule requires that passengers be told options including the right to file a claim or receive a loaner device.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\" Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",

    "summary": "The bill's adoption appeared in doubt leading up to the final vote.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House adopted a budget proposal on Tuesday that paves the way for implementing President Trump's legislative agenda, handing a major victory to House Speaker Mike Johnson who had been trying to sway a small number of holdouts in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Republicans narrowly adopted the resolution in a 217-215 vote with no Democratic support and only one GOP defection \u2014 Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. With one Democrat absent, Johnson could afford to lose just one GOP vote. Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio, Victoria Spartz of Indiana and Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who had said they would not vote for the resolution, ultimately caved.",
      "\"We got it done\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the resolution's adoption. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We are going to deliver the American first agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step in that process.\"",
      "House GOP leadership stalled bringing up the resolution for more than an hour then appeared to pull the vote, before bringing the bill back up minutes later. The House Democratic Whip's Office said Republicans had assured Democrats there would be no further votes before it was brought back up.",
      "Johnson worked the phones with Mr. Trump to persuade holdouts to vote for the package that would enact Mr. Trump's massive defense, border security, energy and tax agenda. At one point before the vote, the House leader huddled in the back of the chamber with Spartz, Burchett and Massie, before leaving the floor with Spartz, who had had a phone to her ear.",
      "The president was a \"big help,\" Johnson said. He added that he didn't make any commitments to holdouts to get them to flip to yes, saying \"we just got everybody to yes.\"",
      "Johnson has been racing to move forward with the resolution, a crucial step in the budget reconciliation process, after House Republican infighting spurred the Senate to forge ahead with a competing plan earlier this month. Johnson won a key victory last week when Mr. Trump endorsed his chamber's budget outline.",
      "The House GOP budget plan instructs committees to craft legislation that would cut $4.5 trillion in taxes and at least $1.5 trillion in spending, while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. If House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be scaled back, according to an amendment to the resolution that was added to appease conservatives.",
      "House Democrats widely oppose the measure, and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, wrote a letter to his caucus on Monday telling them \"it's imperative that we are present with maximum attendance.\"",
      "Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, who gave birth a month ago in her home state, flew to Washington with her newborn son to vote against the resolution. Rep. Kevin Mullin of California, who has been battling a blood clot and infection after recent knee surgery, also made the vote.",
      "\"We had Kevin Mullin literally leave a hospital bed in California, travel here with an IV on the airplane, because he knows how important this vote is,\" said Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the minority whip.",
      "\"Brittany Pettersen is on maternity leave, but she understood on behalf of her constituents and the American people how important it was to be there,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, was the sole absence. The Arizona Democrat has been battling cancer.",
      "Democrats have warned of potential cuts to Medicaid, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits that could be pursued in the budget reconciliation process. The resolution tasks relevant committees with finding billions of dollars in cuts, some of which could target Medicaid, which has prompted concern among some Republicans, especially in battleground districts.",
      "\"This is the very beginning of the process, and they struggled until the very end, Democrats were unified, and we will remain unified throughout this process, because this reckless Republican budget will bring nothing but destruction to the American people,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York was among the Republicans worried about Medicaid cuts, but she met with Johnson on Monday and said he assured her that Medicaid recipients would not be removed from the rolls \"unless they are not fulfilling the work requirements, and they're not citizens.\"",
      "House Republican leadership pushed back on the Medicaid concerns on Tuesday, calling it a Democratic talking point. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota said the budget resolution \"merely unlocks the opportunity for committees to begin drafting legislation,\" calling it a \"blueprint to save America.\" And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that the vote is simply one to begin the reconciliation process.",
      "Still, Johnson wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues, and the budget resolution instructs the committee overseeing Medicaid to find $800 billion in cuts. Johnson said cuts to the program would target \"fraud.\"",
      "\"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" Johnson said, when asked whether there could be cuts to the program down the line. \"What we're talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "The House vote came after the Senate adopted its budget late last week, while the House was away on recess. Since Mr. Trump's endorsement of the House resolution, Senate Republicans have billed their own budget plan as a backup. The Senate plan would divide the reconciliation process into two bills, with the first aimed at quickly delivering resources for border security and defense, while a later bill would tackle the tax priorities. Senate Republicans also want to make the tax cuts permanent, which the House version does not do.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "For the second time in two weeks, DOGE's \"receipts\" don't match its cost-cutting claims.",
    "story": [
      "For the second time in two weeks, DOGE's \"receipts\" don't match its claims.",
      "On Monday, the Department of Government Efficiency released another round of so-called \"receipts\" \u2014 or canceled contracts to show its cost cutting \u2014 and posted them on its \"wall of receipts.\" As was the case with the first round, this set, too, contained inaccuracies.",
      "Despite doubling the number of listed contracts, the updated itemized savings now total $9.6 billion, a sharp drop from the original $16.6 billion in savings DOGE itemized last week. At the same time, DOGE is now claiming total savings of $65 billion \u2014 far higher than the amount itemized, and an increase from its earlier claim of $55 billion, much of which has previously been called into question.",
      "$65 billion is approximately 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget of $6.75 trillion.",
      "DOGE's website claims this higher figure includes savings from contract and lease terminations, renegotiations, grant cancellations, layoffs and other miscellaneous reductions, but DOGE has not supplied documentation for the vast majority of the savings it claims.",
      "In addition, $144.6 million is attributed to real estate savings, but DOGE has provided no supporting details beyond the dollar figure, agency and city, making independent verification difficult.",
      "DOGE has not explained why it reduced the itemized total, but this is likely due to errors in the original reporting \u2014 many of which were first identified by news organizations including CBS News.",
      "Initially, DOGE listed 1,127 receipts. That number has now grown to 2,299, though 34% of them report zero savings. The newly added receipts also contain apparent errors and instances of double, triple and even quadruple counting.",
      "Many of the contracts included in the \"wall of receipts\" were unlikely to reach the amount of savings that DOGE is claiming. According to Michael LeJeune, a private consultant with an expertise in government contracts, many of these are specific types of agreements with \"unfunded requirements and they rarely get used\" to the full amount. He also says it appears that some of these unfunded or partly-funded contracts are being counted multiple times.",
      "For example, there is a quadruple listing for a contract for DEI training and assessment services for the Department of Agriculture. The overall contract was $25 million, and four companies that provided these services drew funding from that single contract. DOGE, however, mistakenly listed each company as having a separate $25 million contract \u2014 wrongly claiming a total of $100 million in savings.",
      "Other listings also raise questions, including:",
      "Three separate items list savings of $15 million each, but each item references the same contract, a blanket purchase agreement, under different contractors. A blanket purchase agreement is a standard government agreement that is often used for simple repetitive purchases. In this case, the Environmental Protection Agency contract was for \"human resources consulting services.\" The Trump administration terminated the agreement on Jan. 25, referring to the contract as \"Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Enterprise Services Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).\" It is unclear how much of the contract's funding had already been spent.",

      "The country's economy has collapsed, and Hamad said he cannot provide for his family.",
      "\"We rely on God and aid,\" he told us.",
      "Right now, it's being left largely up to God.",
      "The soup kitchen provides one small meal per day for Hamad and his wife and four children. His reliance on charity is a source of deep pain for him.",

      "Many of the soup kitchens dotted across Sudan's urban areas have been funded by the U.S. Nearly 80% of them shut down quickly following President Trump's suspension of U.S. foreign aid.",
      "The soup kitchens also served the few hospitals still standing in Omdurman, including Al Noa, which is the largest hospital in Omdurman that has continued functioning during the war. It's about 12 miles from the front lines in the capital Khartoum.",
      "The facility has no funds to provide meals itself. When we visited the hospital, a soup kitchen run by the Emergency Response Room charity was busy serving patients some rice and lentils. It was the only food they would eat that day.",
      "The hospital is overwhelmed and under-resourced. It's been hit by rockets several times during the nearly two-year war. Makeshift tents have been set up outside to cope with the overflow. CBS News saw patients being treated on the floor because of a lack of beds.",
      "In the midst of it all, medical staff under the leadership of Dr. Jamal Mohammad have been struggling to save the lives of those left wounded and starving by the war.",
      "Despite the financial support from the U.S. and other donors, they were already running out of everything from painkillers and bandages to life-saving equipment before Mr. Trump put the brakes on all U.S. foreign aid.",

      "\"What we're seeing now is, I fear, going to mean a lack of respect for the United States, an undermining of U.S. interests, and certainly real negative impacts on the ground for African partners,\" she said.",
      "Lapenn argued that there had been a misrepresentation of USAID's work by officials in Washington.",
      "\"I think the debate now sort of frames USAID as if it was charity, and as if it was charity that we can't afford. And I don't think that's true on either point,\" she said. \"We know it's maybe 1% of the federal budget, so we can afford it. But at the same time, it wasn't charity. It was much more a strategic investment in U.S. relationships globally.\"",
      "Without partnerships with the U.S. some countries may have little choice but to turn elsewhere to try to fill the financial void. Some may have to resort to trading or selling off their natural resources to meet those needs.",

      "Cindy McCain, who heads the U.N.'s World Food Program, said over the weekend that the agency was working to provide support to some 25 million people facing hunger in Sudan, but warning that \"humanitarian services are at the brink.\"",

He was playing with friends by a river when it happened. The little boy was tearful, terrified he would lose his leg and, with it, his dream of being a soccer player.",
      "But he was in good hands. Mohammad was a leading orthopedic surgeon before the war started. He lost everything when the conflict began - his home, his lucrative private practice in Khartoum, his car and his life savings. His family fled to safety in Egypt, but he stayed behind and, for nearly two years, has been running the hospital without any pay.\u00a0 He performs three to four operations on most days.",
      "As young Akram was prepped for surgery later in the day, Mohammad told us he never imagined he would be operating on the war wounded. His previous job was focused on healing broken bones and changing people's lives for the better, not grappling to keep them alive.",
      "But despite the limited resources, he still brings hope. He operated for over four hours on the little boy, repairing the broken bones and removing a large piece of shrapnel from his leg. The operation was a success, and Akram will once again be able to play soccer.",

    "summary": "U.S. Secret Service Director Sean Curran discusses his unusual path to the agency's top job, telling CBS News, \"I'm the unknown.\"",
    "story": [
      "The photo was instantly legendary: former President Trump with his fist in the air, blood seeping from his right ear and an American flag flying overhead.",
      "Sean Curran was a mostly anonymous U.S. Secret Service agent that July day in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a bullet clipped Mr. Trump's ear, coming within inches of his skull. In the photo, Curran is the agent on the right, sunglassed and unsmiling, after he and his team sprang to the former president's side to protect him.",
      "\"Part of me probably still hasn't processed it. I haven't \u2014 from that day to now \u2014 I haven't stopped,\" Curran told CBS News in his first news interview. \"I felt like I couldn't let him out of my sight. Not to the point where I'd be overworked, but to a point where I felt like I needed to be with him to ensure that things were done the way I needed them to be done. I didn't want to leave his side. I think he probably didn't want me to leave his side, either.\"",
      "His relationship with the president was forged over seven years of near daily contact, including two assassination attempts and court hearings that numbered \"too many to count.\" \"I mean we \u2014 it's life-changing,\" Curran said. Just after his second inauguration, Mr. Trump named him director of the Secret Service.",
      "Curran declined to reveal what Mr. Trump said on the way to and from the courthouse or during his arraignments \u2014 or on any occasion \u2014 other than to say Trump remained calm \"every single day, and that's on and off camera.\"",
      "The Secret Service made some preliminary plans for how to accommodate Mr. Trump if he were convicted in his four criminal trials and ultimately sentenced to prison time.",
      "\"We had serious conversations about it, and I at one point told him, he and I might be \u2014 getting a lot closer,\" Curran said, which drew a chuckle from a couple staffers in his office with him on the 8th floor of Secret Service headquarters.",
      "But Curran was serious. \"Look, if it came to it, I'd be sitting right next to him,\" he said. \"That's how much I care for him. That's how much I felt that he deserved the level of protection that any of our protectees should get. There's nothing I would have not done for him.\"",
      "Two federal cases against Trump were dropped during the post-election transition. A conviction in New York resulted in no jail time. Decisions about Mr. Trump's security would have been made by then-Acting Secret Service Director Ron Rowe.",
      "\"I think we would have treated [prison] probably like a site, and we would have had to probably own a certain portion of that facility,\" Curran said. \"It's still a law, you know, whether someone is in prison or not. The law still dictates that we have to protect them.\"",
      "Curran, who grew up in New Jersey, joined the Secret Service in 2001. He was assigned to then-Sen. Barack Obama as part of the Secret Service's dignitary protection division, then to Obama's presidential protection detail. Curran was recognized as special agent of the year in 2007. After a stint working for the assistant director of investigations, he was promoted to run the Secret Service coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign, and later, the protective intelligence squad. During Mr. Trump's first term, Curran became deputy supervisor on Trump's detail, then, in 2021, one of the youngest special agents ever to be named agent in charge.",
      "When his first term ended, Trump was persona non grata politically, and the Secret Service senior leadership team was focused on protecting then-President Biden. According to other agents familiar with the situation, headquarters essentially told Curran to build a post-presidential protective detail on his own.",
      "As the controversial former president geared up for his third White House campaign, Curran and his deputy, Matt Piant, tried to warn headquarters that they couldn't treat Mr. Trump like a regular former president. They believed a typical protective footprint, like the bands of security provided to former presidents Obama or Clinton, wouldn't be enough to accommodate Mr. Trump's schedule as he dashed between campaign rallies and court hearings.",
      "Curran wouldn't talk about the failures at Butler, or what happened in the minutes after the shooting. But he suggested that too many leaders have lost touch with officers and agents out in the field.",
      "\"Good ideas, big ideas, have been hampered by people with probably less experience,\" Curran said, adding that leaders in a higher position don't always understand the reality of teams in the field. \"I understand what people on the ground need.\"",
      "One recent change within the agency's ranks has been to embed a team of six lawyers within Secret Service field operations \u2014 not for oversight of the officers, but for support in dealing with protesters or other circumstances.",
      "At a time when DOGE is cutting agencies it considers bloated, Curran is seeking a larger congressional appropriation. He said it is unclear whether Elon Musk will try to cut staff from the Secret Service. So far, there's no indication of that.",
      "Curran disagrees with a goal set by former director Kimberly Cheatle to make the Secret Service a 30% female workforce by 2030 \u2013 part of a nationwide campaign to diversify the ranks of law enforcement. \"When you highlight a specific group or person, you are not going to get the best qualified candidates,\" he said, echoing Trump's move away from diversity, equity and inclusion or \"DEI\" initiatives. \"My only goal is to put the right people on the field and get the best qualified applicants for this job, no matter what the position is and no matter what they look like.\"",
      "Richard Giuditta, a New Jersey lawyer brought in by Curran as a legal adviser, said one of Curran's first actions, within hours of being appointed director, was to go to the uniformed division's midnight-shift roll call at the White House. \"Quietly, by himself,\" Giuditta said.",
      "In a break with agency precedent, Giuditta is the first political appointee to serve as senior adviser to the Secret Service.",
      "Not everyone inside the agency is certain Curran is the right guy for the job \u2014 field agents aren't typically chosen to lead the Secret Service and its more than 8,000-member workforce.",
      "\"I think overall, people see who I am,\" Curran said. \"They see that I'm out there. They see that I just had a vest on a month ago, and I'm now up here. If you look around historically, that is not what you've seen up here. I've taken a different path. People know that. People are probably scared of that, because I'm the unknown.\"",
      "Curran, who has been at Mr. Trump's side on the golf course, on and off planes, in and out of meetings, recognizes that his relationship with Trump may be fodder for critics.",
      "\"He has always shown respect to not only me, but the division that protected him,\" Curran said. \"We have a bond, probably for life.\"",
      "Any president chafes at restrictions on their freedom of movement, although Curran declined to name any specific incidents. \"If I could broadly speak on this, he and I have had a lot of those tough conversations,\" he said. \"He was always very respectful of my opinion and what we needed to do, and he never once pushed back.\"",
      "The moment in Butler, Pennsylvania \u2014 and the photos \u2014 made Curran a public figure overnight. His face is now plastered on book covers, billboards, t-shirts, tattoos.",
      "Curran would prefer to not be recognized. \"I'm a private guy,\" he said. \"This position by nature \u2014 our role is to kind of be in the shadows. We are not to be part of the picture. Pun intended, I guess.\"",
      "Last week, Curran got a phone call from a former Secret Service agent who, perhaps more than anyone, understood that unwanted spotlight. Clint Hill, 93, was best known for leaping onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot. Hill died on Friday, just one day after reaching out to Curran.",
      "\"I guess he feels like we had a connection,\" Curran said. \"So he wanted to talk to me. That was that.\"",

She brought her sixth-grade son to walk the halls of Congress with her, calling it a \"civics lesson.\"",

      "In the past week, the board received at least 1,845 new cases from employees nationwide. That compares to approximately 100 cases each week in December and January. The surge in challenges from federal employees threatens to slow or choke the board's ability to respond to complaints, according to multiple sources familiar with board operations.",

      "\"The MSPB simply won't be able to review the appeals in any kind of timely fashion,\" Pamela Keith, a Washington-based attorney who specializes in federal workforce issues, told CBS News. \"Before Trump, appeals could take more than a year. Now, we are looking at two or more years of cases.\"",
      "An MSPB spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that \"MSPB has experience adjudicating increased workloads, such as the influx of more than 32,000 furlough appeals in 2013.\"",
      "The board saw a surge in cases in 2013, due to the furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers after a budget standoff and disruptions in federal agency services.",

The nonprofit said that \"MSPB serves as a critical guardrail for democracy and accountability by protecting federal employees from unjust employment actions such as wrongful termination, suspensions, or demotions, ensuring fairness in the federal workforce. MSPB also works to protect whistleblowers who expose government fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers, told CBS News, \"Make no mistake \u2014 this backlog is not a bug, it's a feature of the Trump administration's ongoing effort to dismantle the civil service. The MSPB is one of the few places federal employees can turn to for appealing a wrongful termination, including terminations made for political purposes. For many federal employees, it's the only place.

    "story": [
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Tuesday that the White House press office will choose which outlets get to cover the president in close quarters, replacing the decision-making authority that has long rested with the 100-year-old White House Correspondents Association.",
      "This development followed the White House announcement last week that it was removing the Associated Press wire service from pool coverage and close access to the president. Soon after, the AP sued Leavitt and two other top White House officials in response.",

Leavitt also said other new outlets would also be added to the print pool rotation.",
      "\"We want more outlets and new outlets to have a chance to take part in the press pool to cover this administration's unprecedented achievements up close, front and center,\" Leavitt said during Tuesday's White House press briefing. \"As you all know, for decades, a group of D.C.-based journalists, the White House Correspondents Association, has long dictated which journalists get to ask questions of the president of the United States in these most intimate spaces. Not anymore.\"",
      "\"I am proud to announce that we are going to give the power back to the people who read your papers, who watch your television shows and who listen to your radio stations. Moving forward, the White House press pool will be determined by the White House press team,\" Leavitt said.",

The daily press pool, which is a rotation, covers the president's movements in the Oval Office and elsewhere on the grounds. It travels with him whenever he leaves the White House, whether that's across town to a federal agency or across the globe, at the expense of the news outlets. News organizations pay for seats aboard Air Force One and for other coverage-related costs. It's unclear when the new rotation will be implemented.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 16:03:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Marlean Ames is seeking to revive her lawsuit alleging her employer engaged in reverse discrimination when she was denied a promotion and then demoted.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in an Ohio woman's bid to revive a lawsuit alleging \"reverse discrimination\" after she said she was denied a promotion and demoted because she is straight.",
      "The case centers on what a plaintiff alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act must prove. Marlean Ames, the woman who brought the case, argues that a \"background circumstances\" requirement adopted by some lower courts unfairly imposes a higher burden on her as a heterosexual woman. The standard requires plaintiffs who are members of a majority group to put forth more evidence to show that their employer discriminated against them.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is reviewing the case as President Trump has taken sweeping actions to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and policies throughout the federal government and fired workers overseeing the initiatives.",
      "In the private sector, large companies like McDonald's, Ford and Walmart have walked back their DEI initiatives in recent months in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending affirmative action in college admissions. That landmark ruling prompted more lawsuits from conservative groups targeting diversity initiatives at corporations.",
      "Conservative legal groups like the America First Legal Foundation are backing Ames in the case and have warned that the background circumstances rule forces courts to decide who is a member of a majority group. America First Legal Foundation was founded by Stephen Miller, who now serves as White House deputy chief of staff.",
      "\"The central problem is how to decide who is the 'majority' and who is the 'minority,'\" the group, which has sued companies over their diversity policies, wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court. \"Surprisingly, courts have given this issue almost no attention, generally assuming that 'white men' (and, as below, heterosexuals) are the majority, and everyone else the minority.\"",
      "But others such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said that Ames is asking the court to \"interpret Title VII in a way that ignores the realities of this country's persisting legacy of discrimination in evaluating disparate treatment claims.\"",
      "\"Today, just as when Congress enacted Title VII, Black people and members of other marginalized groups are far more likely to endure employment discrimination than their majority-group counterparts,\" the group wrote.",
      "Allegations of reverse discrimination",
      "Ames started working at the Ohio Department of Youth Services, the state's juvenile corrections system, in 2004 as an executive secretary and became a program administrator in 2014. During her time in that role, she received positive performance reviews, according to court filings.",
      "Ames applied for a promotion to bureau chief of quality assurance and improvement in 2019, but didn't get the job. Her supervisor, Ginine Trim, who is gay, said Ames and two others who applied failed to lay out their vision for the role, according to court filings from Ames' legal team.",
      "The position remained unfilled for months and eventually was offered to a gay woman who had been with the department for less time than Ames, her lawyers said in court papers. The woman didn't interview or apply for the job, and was less qualified than Ames, according to the attorneys.",
      "After Ames was denied the promotion, she was removed from her position as program administrator and told she could either return to her job as executive secretary or be fired. Accepting the demotion, though, would mean a significant pay cut \u2014 from $47.22 an hour to $28.40, according to court filings.",
      "Still, Ames chose to go back to her role as executive secretary and was replaced as program administrator by a gay man, her lawyers said.",
      "Ames sued the Department of Youth Services and alleged violations of Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, religion, national origin and sex, which includes sexual orientation. Ames argued the department discriminated against her on the basis of sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Ohio Department of Youth Services, finding that the department offered \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons\" for passing Ames over for the promotion. The court also concluded that she failed to satisfy the \"background circumstances\" requirement.",
      "Imposed by some courts, the standard requires a plaintiff who is a member of a majority group to show \"background circumstances\" that \"support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority,\" or engages in reverse discrimination.",
      "Plaintiffs can make that showing by presenting evidence that a member of the relevant minority group \u2014 gay people, in Ames' case \u2014 made the employment decision at issue, or by presenting statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern of discrimination by the employer against members of a majority group.",
      "Ames asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to review the district court's decision. The appeals court also found that she failed to satisfy the \"background circumstances\" requirement and threw out her case.",
      "The three-judge panel first said that the decisions about Ames' positions were made by the department's director and assistant director, who are heterosexual. The 6th Circuit also found that Ames' only evidence of a pattern of discrimination was her own experience.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in October to take up Ames' case. In filings with the Supreme Court, her lawyers argued that the \"background circumstances\" test infringes on the text of Title VII, Supreme Court precedent and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's own practices.",
      "They said the standard effectively adds words to the text of Title VII and imposes a new requirement on certain plaintiffs alleging employment discrimination \u2014 those in a majority group. Ames' lawyers also argued that the background circumstances requirement forces courts to draw lines that intentionally treat some plaintiffs less favorably because of protected characteristics.",
      "\"That sort of line drawing does not eradicate discrimination. It perpetuates it,\" they wrote.",
      "Additionally, the lawyers noted that Ames would still have to demonstrate before a jury that she was intentionally discriminated against, but was \"robbed\" of the chance to do so because of the \"background circumstances\" requirement.",
      "But lawyers for the Ohio Department of Youth Services reiterated in a filing that the officials who made decisions about Ames' employment are straight and provided a nondiscriminatory reason for replacing her as program administrator: concerns about her vision for the department.",
      "The \"background circumstances\" requirement, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost wrote, is just another way of determining whether the circumstances surrounding an employment decision suggest that decision was because of a protected characteristic.",
      "The issue, Yost said, is how Ames decided to litigate her case, which he called \"fatal\" to her discrimination claim.",
      "\"At the end of the day, Ames has not identified a single piece of evidence that suggests that sexual orientation played any role in the hiring decision at issue in her promotion claim,\" the state argued.",
      "Ohio officials said the background circumstances standard protects against \"meritless\" Title VII claims, which can \"impose ruinous costs, especially on smaller businesses, that ultimately reduce employment, incent automation, and inflate prices for consumers \u2014 or consume Ohioans' tax dollars.\"",
      "\"Maintaining a robust threshold step, by comparison, ensures that many specious or vexatious Title VII lawsuits die on the desk of busy plaintiffs' lawyers,\" Yost argued.",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed in December, the Biden administration argued the 6th Circuit was wrong to apply a heightened requirement that it said would foreclose some claims that would satisfy Title VII's standard for liability.\u00a0 The previous administration urged the Supreme Court to toss out the lower court's decision and send the case back for more proceedings.",
      "The Trump administration has not indicated that the government's position in the case has changed. A lawyer from the Justice Department will be participating in the argument alongside lawyers for Ames and the Ohio Department of Youth Services.",

    "summary": "Cuts to the U.S. cybersecurity agency and FBI affected the federal workers tasked with stopping foreign interference in elections.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday continued to block the Office of Management and Budget from freezing federal assistance, delivering another blow to the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to shrink federal spending.",
      "Judge Loren AliKhan from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\u00a0ruled in favor of a group of nonprofit organizations in finding that they are likely to succeed in their challenge to the pause on all federal grants, loans and other federal assistance programs. The judge found that the nonprofits proved that the \"funding freeze would be economically catastrophic \u2014 and in some circumstances, fatal \u2014 to their members\" and agreed to grant their request for a preliminary injunction while the case plays out.",
      "AliKhan had previously issued a temporary restraining order that prevented the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance while she considered the nonprofits' request for injunctive relief. The judge held a hearing on their motion last week.",
      "The nonprofit groups had argued that the Trump administration exceeded its authority by ordering the nationwide funding freeze and said it was threatening the federal aid based on their exercise of their First Amendment rights of speech and association. AliKhan agreed in her decision that the government \"may be crossing a constitutional line.\"",
      "\"The scope of power OMB seeks to claim is 'breathtaking,' and its ramifications are massive,\" wrote the judge, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden. \"Because there is no clear statutory hook for this broad assertion of power, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim.\"",
      "AliKhan said that the nonprofits showed a \"mountain of evidence\" that \"even the threat of a funding freeze was enough to send countless organizations into complete disarray.\"",
      "\"While turning off funding streams appears to have been alarmingly easy, turning them back on has proven much more difficult,\" she wrote.",
      "OMB issued its memo directing federal agencies to temporarily pause all activities related to federal financial assistance on Jan. 27. The directive swiftly prompted two lawsuits \u2014 one by the group of nonprofits, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C.; and the second from a group of Democratic-led states, brought in Rhode Island.",
      "But two days after the OMB issued its memo, it was rescinded. Shortly after the memo was walked back, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on social media that the new directive was not a rescission of the federal funding freeze, but solely an unwinding of OMB's Jan. 27 memo.",
      "While the government argued that the White House memo to pause grants and other assistance was rescinded and should not be considered broadly, \"agencies still implemented the original memorandum as written,\" AliKhan wrote in her decision, which resulted in funds for programs like the \"Head Start\" program and funds for small businesses being frozen.",
      "\"Defendants still cannot provide a reasonable explanation for why they needed to freeze all federal financial assistance in less than a day to 'safeguard valuable taxpayer resources,'\" AliKhan added.",
      "The White House budget office's pause on federal assistance is part of President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government. The president also took executive action to order a 90-pause on foreign assistance funding, also the subject of legal challenges, and has fired thousands of federal workers who were considered probationary. Another 75,000 government employees accepted an offer from the new administration to resign their positions but continue receiving full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The Trump administration has hit roadblocks in the courts, as dozens of lawsuits have been filed that challenge Mr. Trump's policies and initiatives aimed at shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "In the Rhode Island case involving the funding freeze, brought by a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia, a federal judge found that the Trump administration had not complied with an earlier order requiring agencies to restore any paused or withheld federal funds. The states had argued that they continued to be denied access to assistance.",
      "The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge John McConnell, demanded the Trump administration reinstate any frozen funds and said the pause on federal assistance is likely unconstitutional.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to comply with a temporary order preventing it from pausing foreign assistance funding issued earlier this month, and gave the State Department until Wednesday night to pay all bills for work completed before Feb. 13.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali granted a motion to enforce his temporary restraining order from Feb. 13. It required the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, to restore foreign-assistance funds for contracts and other awards while proceedings continue in a case brought by a group of businesses, nonprofits and organizations that do foreign aid work.",
      "The contractors had argued that they have been cut off from federal dollars or forced to stop their work because of Mr. Trump's executive action \u2014 and a subsequent directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 that froze foreign development aid for 90 days.",
      "Under Ali's ruling, the State Department and USAID must pay any invoices and drawdown requests owed before Feb. 13 by midnight Wednesday. Ali also ordered the government to turn over any internal directives from the State Department or USAID leadership telling employees to comply with the court's restraining order.",
      "At an emergency hearing Tuesday, a Justice Department lawyer was unable to provide specifics on what steps the Trump administration was taking to restore funding for foreign aid programs.",
      "\"Twelve days into the TRO, you can't give me any facts about funds being unfrozen under the TRO?\" Ali asked government attorneys, referencing the temporary restraining order.",
      "\"The government has done nothing to make these payments happen,\" an attorney for the plaintiffs later argued.",
      "The lawyer for the nonprofits and businesses said there have been \"zero directives\" from the agency with respect to the unfreezing of foreign assistance funds. He added that the government still has to make payments that are owed, even on contracts that have been canceled or suspended in the past few days.",
      "Pointing to the terms of Ali's order, which temporarily lifted the pause on foreign assistance funds, the companies' lawyer said the Trump administration has \"done absolutely nothing to give meaning to that provision.\"",
      "The nonprofit groups and companies asked Ali on Monday to order the \"immediate payment of all funds owed and due to plaintiffs and other USAID and State Department implementing partners.\" The contractors said that despite Ali's temporary restraining order, they were still owed \"millions of dollars on due and overdue invoices and reimbursement requests\" that had been paused, but then ordered to be restored.",
      "A declaration from Zan Northrip, an executive at the international development company DAI Global, said that since Feb. 13, it has not received any payments on $115 million in outstanding bills to USAID. More than $70 million of that is over 30 days late.",
      "The invoices are for work done before a cable Rubio sent on Jan. 24 that announced a 90-day pause on new spending for foreign assistance programs funded through the State Department and USAID, according to DAI Global. The company said it is providing \"up-front financing to the U.S. government of more than $150 million.\"",
      "Northrip wrote that while some stop-work orders have been lifted, none of the 28 project terminations that USAID previously put into effect has been rescinded. DAI Global has furloughed 124 U.S.-based employees as a result, according to the declaration.",
      "USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service, with a large portion of the funding awarded to U.S. organizations that grant funds to local partners worldwide.",
      "While Ali's order provides temporary relief to foreign aid programs and companies, the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID has continued.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a new trial for Richard Glossip\u200b, an Oklahoma death row inmate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a new trial for Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma death row inmate who was joined in his bid to have his conviction thrown out by the state's Republican attorney general.",
      "The high court ruled\u00a05-3 in favor of Glossip and reversed a decision of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals that upheld his conviction and death sentence. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion for the court and was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the court's consideration of the case.",
      "After first finding that the high court has jurisdiction to review the Oklahoma court's decision, Sotomayor wrote that the prosecution's failure to correct testimony of their key witness during the trial violated Glossip's right to due process, entitling him to a new trial.",
      "\"Turning to the merits, we conclude that the prosecution violated its constitutional obligation to correct false testimony,\" she wrote.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the majority's finding as to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, but said she would not order the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set aside Glossip's conviction. Instead, she said would have sent the case back for more proceedings.",
      "In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the Supreme Court lacks the power to override the decisions of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, which declined to grant Glossip clemency in 2023.",
      "\"The court's decision distorts our jurisdiction, imagines a constitutional violation where none occurred, and abandons basic principles governing the disposition of state-court appeals,\" Thomas wrote in a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito.",
      "Gentner Drummond, Oklahoma's attorney general, said his office will review the decision and determine the appropriate course of action.",
      "\"Our justice system is greatly diminished when an individual is convicted without a fair trial, but today we can celebrate that a great injustice has been swept away,\" Drummond said in a statement. \"I am pleased the high court has validated my grave concerns with how this prosecution was handled, and I am thankful we now have a fresh opportunity to see that justice is done.\"",
      "He continued: \"I am grateful the justices understood the gravity of the situation. I have long maintained that I do not believe Mr. Glossip is innocent, but it is now an undeniable fact that he did not receive a fair trial.\"",
      "The Glossip case",
      "Glossip was convicted in the 1997 murder of the owner of the Oklahoma City motel where he worked and was sentenced to death more than two decades ago. Since then, he has seen nine execution dates come and go, and eaten his \"last meal\" three times.",
      "Glossip had also been before the Supreme Court once before, in 2015, when he unsuccessfully challenged Oklahoma's method of execution on Eighth Amendment grounds.",
      "In the latest challenge, his bid to toss out his conviction and grant him a new trial was backed by Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Drummond, because of errors committed during his earlier trial.",
      "A central issue in the court fight involved the testimony of Glossip's co-defendant, Justin Sneed, who claimed Glossip paid him $10,000 to kill Barry Van Treese, the motel owner.",
      "Sneed admitted to robbing and bludgeoning Van Treese and is serving a sentence of life in prison. Glossip, meanwhile, has said he was not involved in the murder and repeatedly maintained his innocence over his roughly 25 years on death row.",
      "Glossip's first conviction was overturned because of ineffective assistance of counsel. During his second trial, Sneed told prosecutors that he had never seen a psychiatrist, but was given lithium after he was arrested. But in 2022, the state found prosecutors' handwritten notes in a banker's box, which Drummond said called into question Sneed's credibility as a witness.",
      "Lawyers for Glossip and Drummond argued the notes showed that Sneed told prosecutors he was given lithium after seeing a jailhouse psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. But neither his diagnosis nor his treatment by the psychiatrist were disclosed to Glossip's defense team, which Drummond said indicated prosecutors elicited false testimony on the matter.",
      "Following the revelations, Oklahoma's attorney general disclosed the box's materials to Glossip and had an independent counsel review the case. That examination, conducted by former district attorney Rex Duncan, ended in April 2023 and concluded that Glossip was deprived of a fair trial.",
      "The state asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to toss out Glossip's conviction and sentence, arguing that the errors committed during the trial rendered both flaws. But the court denied relief and ordered the state to move forward with executing Glossip.

      "Glossip and Drummond then urged the Supreme Court to step in. The court in May 2023 agreed to pause his execution and months later agreed to hear his case. Gorsuch did not participate in the proceedings, likely because of earlier involvement when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Oklahoma.",
      "Arguments in the case took place in early October at the start of the Supreme Court's new term.

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",
      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",
      "Lithium deposits, meanwhile, are scattered across Ukraine's central, east and southeast regions \u2014 the latter of which are currently held largely by Russia. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries found in everything from electric vehicles to laptops and smartphones.",
      "Ukraine also holds about 20% of the world's global reserves of graphite. Commonly used in pencils, the soft substance is also used in industrial lubricants for motors and other machinery.",
      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed the U.S. has given Ukraine $350 billion in assistance since the war started three years ago, and made it clear he wants to get that back.",
      "Ukraine Oversight, a U.S. interagency watchdog group, says the U.S. has provided no more than $183 billion, however, and roughly a third of that was spent domestically in the U.S. to manufacture ammunition and other weapons and equipment to be used by Ukraine.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Kennedy said in\u00a0a post\u00a0on X in November that \"Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.\"",
      "Dental experts largely disagree.",
      "Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0in\u00a0November there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years, showing that fluoride is both safe and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids' intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\"I don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\" Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \"This isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\"",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\"I think the anti-fluoride people, they're latching onto Kennedy's opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\" Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impact may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades and said the lack of fluoride showed.",
      "\"I'd have a patient come in without cavities or anything else like that, and I'd say, 'You didn't grow up here. Where did you grow up?' ... because everybody here has lots of cavities!\" he said.",

      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet.

      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have fluctuated since then, according to NASA and the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say the risk of it making contact with Earth is remote \u2014 with NASA giving it as high as a 3.1% chance before reducing its estimate to 0.28%, and the European agency putting it at 0.16%, down from around 2.8% \u2014 when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "summary": "Cuts to the U.S. cybersecurity agency and FBI affected the federal workers tasked with stopping foreign interference in elections.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",

      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",

      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",
      "Like many Americans with medical needs not covered by insurance, the Batemans turned to crowdsourcing.",
      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",

      "Across the country in Maryland, 9-year-old Tyraun \"Taj\" Johnson was also trying to raise money for a Hero Arm. He was born with a partial left hand. His family worked hand specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine to look at surgery and different prosthesis options to give him some usage of his left hand. They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",
      "\"You're telling me that a kid able to function with daily tasks \u2013 something as small as feeding themselves, getting dressed...You're telling me that that's not medically necessary?\" his mother, Kaitlin Skinner, asked.",
      "\"I would give Taj my left hand if I could,\" Kaitlin added.",
      "The family started lemonade stands to raise the money for the bionic arm. In four months, they had only made $1,500.",
      "Then they got a life-changing call from Remi's mom. The Bateman's offered to use the donations they received for Remi's arm for Taj's Hero Arm.",
      "Open Bionics helped connect the families. Samantha Payne, co-founder of Open Bionics, told CBS News clinicians spend a lot of time assisting families in appealing insurance denials.\u00a0 \"The technology is 20 years old and has been tested,\" added Payne.",
      "A dream come true",
      "Kaitlin was brought to tears by the Batemans' generous offer and thanked them for making Taj's dream come true.",
      "\"Taj got teary eyed when he saw a video of Remi holding a fork with the Hero Arm,\" Kaitlin said. One of the things Taj is most looking forward to is playing sports.",
      "Kaitlin recently drove to New York City with Taj to meet Daniel Green, upper limb prosthetist at Open Bionics, who will make the mold that will become Taj's Hero Arm. While in New York, Taj had a surprise visitor: Remi and her mom. They arrived at our invitation.",
      "A new friendship forged through the kindness of strangers. Remi and Taj plan to meet again during the summer.",
      "\"If we have a playdate with our [Hero] robot arms, we could be like Ironman,\" Remi said.",
      "Donations for Remi continued to pour in. So she's continued to pay it forward, using the fund to help two more 11 year olds fund their Hero Arms after insurance denied their claims.",

      "The Secret Service made some preliminary plans for how to accommodate Mr. Trump if he were convicted in his four criminal trials and ultimately sentenced to prison time.",
      "\"We had serious conversations about it, and I at one point told him, he and I might be \u2014 getting a lot closer,\" Curran said, which drew a chuckle from a couple staffers in his office with him on the 8th floor of Secret Service headquarters.",
      "But Curran was serious. \"Look, if it came to it, I'd be sitting right next to him,\" he said. \"That's how much I care for him. That's how much I felt that he deserved the level of protection that any of our protectees should get. There's nothing I would have not done for him.\"",
      "Two federal cases against Trump were dropped during the post-election transition. A conviction in New York resulted in no jail time. Decisions about Mr. Trump's security would have been made by then-Acting Secret Service Director Ron Rowe.",
      "\"I think we would have treated [prison] probably like a site, and we would have had to probably own a certain portion of that facility,\" Curran said. \"It's still a law, you know, whether someone is in prison or not. The law still dictates that we have to protect them.\"",
      "Curran, who grew up in New Jersey, joined the Secret Service in 2001. He was assigned to then-Sen. Barack Obama as part of the Secret Service's dignitary protection division, then to Obama's presidential protection detail. Curran was recognized as special agent of the year in 2007. After a stint working for the assistant director of investigations, he was promoted to run the Secret Service coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign, and later, the protective intelligence squad. During Mr. Trump's first term, Curran became deputy supervisor on Trump's detail, then, in 2021, one of the youngest special agents ever to be named agent in charge.",
      "When his first term ended, Trump was persona non grata politically, and the Secret Service senior leadership team was focused on protecting then-President Biden. According to other agents familiar with the situation, headquarters essentially told Curran to build a post-presidential protective detail on his own.",
      "As the controversial former president geared up for his third White House campaign, Curran and his deputy, Matt Piant, tried to warn headquarters that they couldn't treat Mr. Trump like a regular former president. They believed a typical protective footprint, like the bands of security provided to former presidents Obama or Clinton, wouldn't be enough to accommodate Mr. Trump's schedule as he dashed between campaign rallies and court hearings.",
      "Curran wouldn't talk about the failures at Butler, or what happened in the minutes after the shooting. But he suggested that too many leaders have lost touch with officers and agents out in the field.",
      "\"Good ideas, big ideas, have been hampered by people with probably less experience,\" Curran said, adding that leaders in a higher position don't always understand the reality of teams in the field. \"I understand what people on the ground need.\"",
      "One recent change within the agency's ranks has been to embed a team of six lawyers within Secret Service field operations \u2014 not for oversight of the officers, but for support in dealing with protesters or other circumstances.",
      "At a time when DOGE is cutting agencies it considers bloated, Curran is seeking a larger congressional appropriation. He said it is unclear whether Elon Musk will try to cut staff from the Secret Service. So far, there's no indication of that.",
      "Curran disagrees with a goal set by former director Kimberly Cheatle to make the Secret Service a 30% female workforce by 2030 \u2013 part of a nationwide campaign to diversify the ranks of law enforcement. \"When you highlight a specific group or person, you are not going to get the best qualified candidates,\" he said, echoing Trump's move away from diversity, equity and inclusion or \"DEI\" initiatives. \"My only goal is to put the right people on the field and get the best qualified applicants for this job, no matter what the position is and no matter what they look like.\"",
      "Richard Giuditta, a New Jersey lawyer brought in by Curran as a legal adviser, said one of Curran's first actions, within hours of being appointed director, was to go to the uniformed division's midnight-shift roll call at the White House. \"Quietly, by himself,\" Giuditta said.",
      "In a break with agency precedent, Giuditta is the first political appointee to serve as senior adviser to the Secret Service.",
      "Not everyone inside the agency is certain Curran is the right guy for the job \u2014 field agents aren't typically chosen to lead the Secret Service and its more than 8,000-member workforce.",
      "\"I think overall, people see who I am,\" Curran said. \"They see that I'm out there. They see that I just had a vest on a month ago, and I'm now up here. If you look around historically, that is not what you've seen up here. I've taken a different path. People know that. People are probably scared of that, because I'm the unknown.\"",
      "Curran, who has been at Mr. Trump's side on the golf course, on and off planes, in and out of meetings, recognizes that his relationship with Trump may be fodder for critics.",
      "\"He has always shown respect to not only me, but the division that protected him,\" Curran said. \"We have a bond, probably for life.\"",
      "Any president chafes at restrictions on their freedom of movement, although Curran declined to name any specific incidents. \"If I could broadly speak on this, he and I have had a lot of those tough conversations,\" he said. \"He was always very respectful of my opinion and what we needed to do, and he never once pushed back.\"",
      "The moment in Butler, Pennsylvania \u2014 and the photos \u2014 made Curran a public figure overnight. His face is now plastered on book covers, billboards, t-shirts, tattoos.",
      "Curran would prefer to not be recognized. \"I'm a private guy,\" he said. \"This position by nature \u2014 our role is to kind of be in the shadows. We are not to be part of the picture. Pun intended, I guess.\"",
      "Last week, Curran got a phone call from a former Secret Service agent who, perhaps more than anyone, understood that unwanted spotlight. Clint Hill, 93, was best known for leaping onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot. Hill died on Friday, just one day after reaching out to Curran.",
      "\"I guess he feels like we had a connection,\" Curran said. \"So he wanted to talk to me. That was that.\"",

      "In the past week, the board received at least 1,845 new cases from employees nationwide. That compares to approximately 100 cases each week in December and January. The surge in challenges from federal employees threatens to slow or choke the board's ability to respond to complaints, according to multiple sources familiar with board operations.",
      "MSPB is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has six regional offices nationwide. It reported having approximately 190 full-time employees in 2024.",
      "The agency juggles a series of regular duties, including legal research, studies of the civil service, and \u2014 of particular note amid widespread federal layoffs\u00a0\u2014 it hears cases brought by federal workers who argue they were subject to unfair firings or improper and politicized conduct inside their federal agencies.",
      "\"The MSPB simply won't be able to review the appeals in any kind of timely fashion,\" Pamela Keith, a Washington-based attorney who specializes in federal workforce issues, told CBS News. \"Before Trump, appeals could take more than a year. Now, we are looking at two or more years of cases.\"",
      "An MSPB spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that \"MSPB has experience adjudicating increased workloads, such as the influx of more than 32,000 furlough appeals in 2013.\"",
      "The board saw a surge in cases in 2013, due to the furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers after a budget standoff and disruptions in federal agency services.",
      "In a report reviewed by CBS News, the board said that in 2013, the surge of cases hampered the board's operations, including by \"straining MSPB's processes and IT infrastructure.\"",
      "The report also said that \"MSPB's paralegals and legal assistants in the regional and field offices worked overtime to manage this massive workload and MSPB hired temporary employees to assist in docketing cases.

The daily press pool, which is a rotation, covers the president's movements in the Oval Office and elsewhere on the grounds. It travels with him whenever he leaves the White House, whether that's across town to a federal agency or across the globe, at the expense of the news outlets. News organizations pay for seats aboard Air Force One and for other coverage-related costs. It's unclear when the new rotation will be implemented.",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents Association, said in a statement that the White House's decision \"tears at the independence of a free press in the United States.\"",
      "\"It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president,\" Daniels said. \"In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.\"",
      "Daniels said the White House didn't give the WHCA board advance notice of its decision.",
      "\"For generations, the working journalists elected to lead the White House Correspondents' Association board have consistently expanded the WHCA's membership and its pool rotations to facilitate the inclusion of new and emerging outlets,\" Daniels added.",
      "The announcement comes four days after the AP sued Leavitt, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich over the White House's decision to restrict its access to the president. The White House restricted the AP's access after the news outlet's stylebook declined to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as \"The Gulf of America,\" a new name announced by President Trump by executive order. The WHCA filed an amicus brief in support of the AP.",
      "On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor N. McFadden, who was appointed by President Trump, said the AP's circumstances were \"not the type of dire situation\" that requires emergency intervention, but he did order an expedited hearing to consider an injunction against the Trump administration. The case is still being litigated.",
      "\"Asking the president of the United States questions in limited spaces such as the Oval Office and Air Force One is a privilege that unfortunately has only been granted to a few,\" Leavitt said Tuesday. \"It is not a legal right for all.\"",
      "The WHCA, a nonprofit organization that represents more than 400 journalists covering the White House, has long decided which outlets are a part of the pool rotation covering presidents, and who sits in which chairs in the White House briefing room.",

    "story": [
      "A Georgia sheriff's deputy won't face criminal charges for fatally shooting a Black man during a 2023 traffic stop that spiraled into a violent struggle, the district attorney who examined body camera video and other evidence in the killing said Tuesday.",
      "Leonard Cure, 53, was killed just three years after Florida authorities had freed him from prison after serving 16 years for a crime he did not commit.",
      "Staff Sgt. Buck Aldridge, a White deputy in Camden County, Georgia, pulled Cure over for speeding on Interstate 95 near the Florida line on Oct. 16, 2023. Aldridge ordered Cure to get out of his pickup truck and shocked him with a stun gun when Cure refused to put his hands behind his back. Body and dash camera video showed Cure was fighting back and had a hand at Aldridge's throat when he was shot point-blank.",
      "\"Use of deadly force at that point was objectively reasonable given that he was being overpowered at that time,\" District Attorney Keith Higgins told The Associated Press in a phone interview Tuesday.",
      "Attorneys Ben Crump and Harry Daniels, who are representing Cure's family, have insisted Aldridge used excessive force.",
      "\"This decision is a devastating failure of justice, sending the message that law enforcement officers can take a life without consequence,\" they said in a statement. \"Leonard Cure was a man who had already fought so hard to reclaim his life after a wrongful conviction, only to have it stolen from him again. His family will not stop fighting for accountability, and neither will we.\"",
      "Cure had been exonerated in 2020 by the Broward State Attorney's Office in Fort Lauderdale for a 2003 armed robbery of a drug store. He was the first person to be exonerated by the office's conviction review unit.",
      "The unit found that Cure had strong alibis and that the case against him lacked physical evidence or solid witnesses, CBS Miami reported.",
      "\"We are devastated by the death of Leonard Cure,\" Broward State Attorney Harold F. Pryor said at the time of his death. \"The Leonard we knew was a smart, funny and kind person.\"",
      "Seth Miller, the executive director of the Innocence Project of Florida, which worked on Cure's wrongful conviction case, told CBS Miami after Cure's death that he had recently bought his first home in Georgia.",
      "\"That's where he was going,\" Miller said.",
      "Miller said individuals like Cure who have been wrongfully convicted often live in fear.",
      "\"That at any moment, the liberty that you work so hard to achieve after a wrongful incarceration can be taken away from you,\" he told CBS Miami.",
      "Deputy Dalton Vernakes, a spokesman for Camden County Sheriff James Kevin Chaney, confirmed Aldridge remains employed by the sheriff. Aldridge had been placed on administrative leave while Cure's shooting was investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Vernakes said he did not immediately know whether Aldridge had returned to normal duties.",
      "An attorney for Aldridge, Adrienne Browning, did not immediately return an email message seeking comment Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Cure's family have said the Camden County sheriff should never have hired Aldridge, who was fired by the neighboring Kingsland Police Department in 2017 after being disciplined a third time for using excessive force. Personnel records show the sheriff hired him nine months later.",
      "A year ago, Cure's family filed a federal lawsuit against Aldridge and then-Sheriff Jim Proctor in U.S. District Court, seeking $16 million. It accuses Aldridge of using excessive force and Proctor of ignoring the deputy's history of violence. Both have denied wrongdoing in court filings. The case is still pending in U.S. District Court.",

      "An American pilot killed in World War II has been accounted for 80 years after his bomber \u2014 dubbed \"Heaven Can Wait\" \u2014 crashed off the coast of New Guinea, U.S. officials revealed Monday.",
      "U.S. Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Herbert G. Tennyson, 24, of Wichita, Kansas, was officially accounted for on Sept. 25, 2024, and Tennyson's family recently received their full briefing on his identification, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) said in a news release.",
      "On March 11, 1944, Tennyson was the pilot onboard a B-24D Liberator bomber called \"Heaven Can Wait\" during a bombing mission in Hansa Bay, located along the northern coast of New Guinea. Officials said crew members from other aircraft in the formation reported seeing flames shooting out from the bomb bay and tail of Tennyson's plane.\u00a0 Military officials believe anti-aircraft fire had hit the plane, causing one of the bombs it was carrying to explode.",
      "Airmen from other planes in the formation reported seeing \"Heaven Can Wait\" pitching up violently before banking left and plummeting into the Pacific Ocean. Several aircraft circled the crash site to search for signs of life.",
      "\"After the bombing run the formation circled to the right and endeavored with binoculars to see signs of survivors,\" Sgt. Arnold S. Smith, a waist gunner aboard another plane in the formation,\u00a0reported\u00a0at the time. \"I could see no evidence that bodies remained at the surface.\"",
      "After the war, a special unit of the U.S. military conducted extensive searches of crash sites in New Guinea. In 1950, officials concluded the remains of Tennyson and the 10 other \"Heaven Can Wait\" crew members killed in the crash were non-recoverable.",
      "In October 2017, an organization called Project Recover located the wreckage of a B-24 aircraft in Hansa Bay while making sonar scans during a survey, and it was eventually confirmed to be the final resting place of \"Heaven Can Wait.\" Two years later, a DPAA underwater investigation team conducted multiple surveys of the wreckage, clearing the site of any undetonated explosives.",
      "Finally, in 2023, an underwater recovery team excavated the crash site. The recovered evidence, which included life support equipment and identification tags, was sent to a DPAA laboratory for analysis.",
      "Scientists were finally able to identify Tennyson's remains, using dental and anthropological analysis and mitochondrial DNA analysis, as well as material and circumstantial evidence.",
      "Tennyson will be buried in Wichita, Kansas, on a date yet to be determined.",
      "Tennyson is at least the fourth crewmember of \"Heaven Can Wait\" to be positively identified by the U.S. military. Just last month, DPAA announced that Army Air Forces Staff Sgt. Eugene J. Darrigan, 26, of Wappinger's Falls, New York, was accounted for. Darrigan was the radio operator on board the bomber.",

    "summary": "Marlean Ames is seeking to revive her lawsuit alleging her employer engaged in reverse discrimination when she was denied a promotion and then demoted.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in an Ohio woman's bid to revive a lawsuit alleging \"reverse discrimination\" after she said she was denied a promotion and demoted because she is straight.",
      "The case centers on what a plaintiff alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act must prove. Marlean Ames, the woman who brought the case, argues that a \"background circumstances\" requirement adopted by some lower courts unfairly imposes a higher burden on her as a heterosexual woman. The standard requires plaintiffs who are members of a majority group to put forth more evidence to show that their employer discriminated against them.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is reviewing the case as President Trump has taken sweeping actions to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and policies throughout the federal government and fired workers overseeing the initiatives.",
      "In the private sector, large companies like McDonald's, Ford and Walmart have walked back their DEI initiatives in recent months in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending affirmative action in college admissions. That landmark ruling prompted more lawsuits from conservative groups targeting diversity initiatives at corporations.",
      "Conservative legal groups like the America First Legal Foundation are backing Ames in the case and have warned that the background circumstances rule forces courts to decide who is a member of a majority group. America First Legal Foundation was founded by Stephen Miller, who now serves as White House deputy chief of staff.",
      "\"The central problem is how to decide who is the 'majority' and who is the 'minority,'\" the group, which has sued companies over their diversity policies, wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court. \"Surprisingly, courts have given this issue almost no attention, generally assuming that 'white men' (and, as below, heterosexuals) are the majority, and everyone else the minority.\"",
      "But others such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said that Ames is asking the court to \"interpret Title VII in a way that ignores the realities of this country's persisting legacy of discrimination in evaluating disparate treatment claims.\"",
      "\"Today, just as when Congress enacted Title VII, Black people and members of other marginalized groups are far more likely to endure employment discrimination than their majority-group counterparts,\" the group wrote.",
      "Allegations of reverse discrimination",
      "Ames started working at the Ohio Department of Youth Services, the state's juvenile corrections system, in 2004 as an executive secretary and became a program administrator in 2014. During her time in that role, she received positive performance reviews, according to court filings.",
      "Ames applied for a promotion to bureau chief of quality assurance and improvement in 2019, but didn't get the job. Her supervisor, Ginine Trim, who is gay, said Ames and two others who applied failed to lay out their vision for the role, according to court filings from Ames' legal team.",
      "The position remained unfilled for months and eventually was offered to a gay woman who had been with the department for less time than Ames, her lawyers said in court papers. The woman didn't interview or apply for the job, and was less qualified than Ames, according to the attorneys.",
      "After Ames was denied the promotion, she was removed from her position as program administrator and told she could either return to her job as executive secretary or be fired. Accepting the demotion, though, would mean a significant pay cut \u2014 from $47.22 an hour to $28.40, according to court filings.",
      "Still, Ames chose to go back to her role as executive secretary and was replaced as program administrator by a gay man, her lawyers said.",
      "Ames sued the Department of Youth Services and alleged violations of Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, religion, national origin and sex, which includes sexual orientation. Ames argued the department discriminated against her on the basis of sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Ohio Department of Youth Services, finding that the department offered \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons\" for passing Ames over for the promotion. The court also concluded that she failed to satisfy the \"background circumstances\" requirement.",
      "Imposed by some courts, the standard requires a plaintiff who is a member of a majority group to show \"background circumstances\" that \"support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority,\" or engages in reverse discrimination.",
      "Plaintiffs can make that showing by presenting evidence that a member of the relevant minority group \u2014 gay people, in Ames' case \u2014 made the employment decision at issue, or by presenting statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern of discrimination by the employer against members of a majority group.",
      "Ames asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to review the district court's decision. The appeals court also found that she failed to satisfy the \"background circumstances\" requirement and threw out her case.",
      "The three-judge panel first said that the decisions about Ames' positions were made by the department's director and assistant director, who are heterosexual. The 6th Circuit also found that Ames' only evidence of a pattern of discrimination was her own experience.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in October to take up Ames' case. In filings with the Supreme Court, her lawyers argued that the \"background circumstances\" test infringes on the text of Title VII, Supreme Court precedent and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's own practices.",
      "They said the standard effectively adds words to the text of Title VII and imposes a new requirement on certain plaintiffs alleging employment discrimination \u2014 those in a majority group. Ames' lawyers also argued that the background circumstances requirement forces courts to draw lines that intentionally treat some plaintiffs less favorably because of protected characteristics.",
      "\"That sort of line drawing does not eradicate discrimination. It perpetuates it,\" they wrote.",
      "Additionally, the lawyers noted that Ames would still have to demonstrate before a jury that she was intentionally discriminated against, but was \"robbed\" of the chance to do so because of the \"background circumstances\" requirement.",
      "But lawyers for the Ohio Department of Youth Services reiterated in a filing that the officials who made decisions about Ames' employment are straight and provided a nondiscriminatory reason for replacing her as program administrator: concerns about her vision for the department.",
      "The \"background circumstances\" requirement, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost wrote, is just another way of determining whether the circumstances surrounding an employment decision suggest that decision was because of a protected characteristic.",
      "The issue, Yost said, is how Ames decided to litigate her case, which he called \"fatal\" to her discrimination claim.",
      "\"At the end of the day, Ames has not identified a single piece of evidence that suggests that sexual orientation played any role in the hiring decision at issue in her promotion claim,\" the state argued.",
      "Ohio officials said the background circumstances standard protects against \"meritless\" Title VII claims, which can \"impose ruinous costs, especially on smaller businesses, that ultimately reduce employment, incent automation, and inflate prices for consumers \u2014 or consume Ohioans' tax dollars.\"",
      "\"Maintaining a robust threshold step, by comparison, ensures that many specious or vexatious Title VII lawsuits die on the desk of busy plaintiffs' lawyers,\" Yost argued.",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed in December, the Biden administration argued the 6th Circuit was wrong to apply a heightened requirement that it said would foreclose some claims that would satisfy Title VII's standard for liability.\u00a0 The previous administration urged the Supreme Court to toss out the lower court's decision and send the case back for more proceedings.",
      "The Trump administration has not indicated that the government's position in the case has changed. A lawyer from the Justice Department will be participating in the argument alongside lawyers for Ames and the Ohio Department of Youth Services.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday continued to block the Office of Management and Budget from freezing federal assistance, delivering another blow to the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to shrink federal spending.",
      "Judge Loren AliKhan from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\u00a0ruled in favor of a group of nonprofit organizations in finding that they are likely to succeed in their challenge to the pause on all federal grants, loans and other federal assistance programs. The judge found that the nonprofits proved that the \"funding freeze would be economically catastrophic \u2014 and in some circumstances, fatal \u2014 to their members\" and agreed to grant their request for a preliminary injunction while the case plays out.",
      "AliKhan had previously issued a temporary restraining order that prevented the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance while she considered the nonprofits' request for injunctive relief. The judge held a hearing on their motion last week.",
      "The nonprofit groups had argued that the Trump administration exceeded its authority by ordering the nationwide funding freeze and said it was threatening the federal aid based on their exercise of their First Amendment rights of speech and association. AliKhan agreed in her decision that the government \"may be crossing a constitutional line.\"",
      "\"The scope of power OMB seeks to claim is 'breathtaking,' and its ramifications are massive,\" wrote the judge, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden. \"Because there is no clear statutory hook for this broad assertion of power, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim.\"",
      "AliKhan said that the nonprofits showed a \"mountain of evidence\" that \"even the threat of a funding freeze was enough to send countless organizations into complete disarray.\"",
      "\"While turning off funding streams appears to have been alarmingly easy, turning them back on has proven much more difficult,\" she wrote.",
      "OMB issued its memo directing federal agencies to temporarily pause all activities related to federal financial assistance on Jan. 27. The directive swiftly prompted two lawsuits \u2014 one by the group of nonprofits, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C.; and the second from a group of Democratic-led states, brought in Rhode Island.",
      "But two days after the OMB issued its memo, it was rescinded. Shortly after the memo was walked back, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on social media that the new directive was not a rescission of the federal funding freeze, but solely an unwinding of OMB's Jan. 27 memo.",
      "While the government argued that the White House memo to pause grants and other assistance was rescinded and should not be considered broadly, \"agencies still implemented the original memorandum as written,\" AliKhan wrote in her decision, which resulted in funds for programs like the \"Head Start\" program and funds for small businesses being frozen.",
      "\"Defendants still cannot provide a reasonable explanation for why they needed to freeze all federal financial assistance in less than a day to 'safeguard valuable taxpayer resources,'\" AliKhan added.",
      "The White House budget office's pause on federal assistance is part of President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government. The president also took executive action to order a 90-pause on foreign assistance funding, also the subject of legal challenges, and has fired thousands of federal workers who were considered probationary. Another 75,000 government employees accepted an offer from the new administration to resign their positions but continue receiving full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The Trump administration has hit roadblocks in the courts, as dozens of lawsuits have been filed that challenge Mr. Trump's policies and initiatives aimed at shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "In the Rhode Island case involving the funding freeze, brought by a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia, a federal judge found that the Trump administration had not complied with an earlier order requiring agencies to restore any paused or withheld federal funds. The states had argued that they continued to be denied access to assistance.",
      "The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge John McConnell, demanded the Trump administration reinstate any frozen funds and said the pause on federal assistance is likely unconstitutional.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice.

      "A Missouri woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal charge accusing her of concocting a brazen plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property before a judge halted the mysterious foreclosure sale.",
      "During a hearing in front of a Memphis federal judge, Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She previously pleaded not guilty to the two-count indictment, which also includes a count of aggravated identity theft that will now be dropped.",
      "When asked by the judge if Findley was admitting guilt and accepting responsibility, she said \"Yes.\" Findley will be sentenced on June 19. She would have faced up to 20 years if convicted, but she is expected to receive less than that under the plea deal.",
      "\"We are grateful for the hard work of the federal investigators and prosecutors who secured this conviction,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. \"Graceland matters so much to so many people around the world \u2013 just go to Memphis during Elvis Week and listen to all the different accents and languages of fans who make the pilgrimage. All of Tennessee is glad that Graceland remains safely in the possession of Elvis's heir and that it will remain a celebrated Memphis landmark for generations to come.\"",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan\u00a0before her death in January 2023, prosecutors alleged when she was\u00a0charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents, and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "In May, a public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owes $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.",
      "Keough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending \u2014 the bogus lender authorities say Findley created \u2014 said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough's lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.",
      "Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate's lawsuit. The judge said the notary's affidavit brings into question \"the authenticity of the signature.\"",
      "The judge halted the foreclosure sale of the beloved Memphis tourist attraction, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing that a company's attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.",
      "Elvis bought Graceland in 1957 and died there in 1977, and about five years later, the mansion was opened to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the 17,552-square-foot mansion each year, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Visitors can then stop at the large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street.",
      "Elvis and other members of the Presley family, including Lisa Marie Presley and her son, Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide in 2020, are buried on the mansion's grounds.",
      "Keough, who starred in the television series hit \"Daisy Jones and The Six,\" said in a 2024 interview\u00a0with CBS News that she plans to continue running the beloved property and keep the mansion in the family.

      "\"The government has done nothing to make these payments happen,\" an attorney for the plaintiffs later argued.",
      "The lawyer for the nonprofits and businesses said there have been \"zero directives\" from the agency with respect to the unfreezing of foreign assistance funds. He added that the government still has to make payments that are owed, even on contracts that have been canceled or suspended in the past few days.",
      "Pointing to the terms of Ali's order, which temporarily lifted the pause on foreign assistance funds, the companies' lawyer said the Trump administration has \"done absolutely nothing to give meaning to that provision.\"",
      "The nonprofit groups and companies asked Ali on Monday to order the \"immediate payment of all funds owed and due to plaintiffs and other USAID and State Department implementing partners.\" The contractors said that despite Ali's temporary restraining order, they were still owed \"millions of dollars on due and overdue invoices and reimbursement requests\" that had been paused, but then ordered to be restored.",
      "A declaration from Zan Northrip, an executive at the international development company DAI Global, said that since Feb. 13, it has not received any payments on $115 million in outstanding bills to USAID. More than $70 million of that is over 30 days late.",
      "The invoices are for work done before a cable Rubio sent on Jan. 24 that announced a 90-day pause on new spending for foreign assistance programs funded through the State Department and USAID, according to DAI Global. The company said it is providing \"up-front financing to the U.S. government of more than $150 million.\"",
      "Northrip wrote that while some stop-work orders have been lifted, none of the 28 project terminations that USAID previously put into effect has been rescinded. DAI Global has furloughed 124 U.S.-based employees as a result, according to the declaration.",
      "USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service, with a large portion of the funding awarded to U.S. organizations that grant funds to local partners worldwide.",

      "The brand said it's responding to customer trends and preferences in making the changes.",
      "\"As part of our plan to get back to Starbucks, we're simplifying our menu to focus on fewer, more popular items, executed with excellence,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"This will make way for innovation, help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company. \"",
      "When will the Starbucks drink menu change?",
      "The Starbucks menu changes will go into effect on March 4.",
      "The company offers recommendations for fans of the soon-to-be eliminated drinks to try instead. For example, a spokesperson encouraged Iced Matcha Lemonade fans to try the Green Tea Lemonade, which will remain on the menu.",

      "As far as the menu changes go, while a small share of customers might miss the beverages that are being eliminated, Starbucks probably \"did the math and figured the cost of keeping them on the menu was greater than the benefits,\" Cohan said.",

      "Seven planets are aligning in the night sky this week, creating a brief chance to see a \"planetary parade.\"",
      "Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus could all be visible with clear skies, but not all can be seen by the naked eye, according to Space.com and other sites that track celestial events.",
      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Which day is best will depend on the location. Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York will have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March. Worldwide, the best day to see the alignment will be Feb. 28.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

      "Well-heeled professionals have been lining up for food handouts. There has been a complete erosion of the middle class.",
      "CBS News met Mohammed Hamad in one of the lines. He's an electrical engineer and once had a lucrative business. But like so many others in Sudan, he's found that the raging civil war has meant there's no work, and no income.",
      "The country's economy has collapsed, and Hamad said he cannot provide for his family.",
      "\"We rely on God and aid,\" he told us.",
      "Right now, it's being left largely up to God.",
      "The soup kitchen provides one small meal per day for Hamad and his wife and four children. His reliance on charity is a source of deep pain for him.",

      "The soup kitchens also served the few hospitals still standing in Omdurman, including Al Noa, which is the largest hospital in Omdurman that has continued functioning during the war. It's about 12 miles from the front lines in the capital Khartoum.",
      "The facility has no funds to provide meals itself. When we visited the hospital, a soup kitchen run by the Emergency Response Room charity was busy serving patients some rice and lentils. It was the only food they would eat that day.",
      "The hospital is overwhelmed and under-resourced. It's been hit by rockets several times during the nearly two-year war. Makeshift tents have been set up outside to cope with the overflow. CBS News saw patients being treated on the floor because of a lack of beds.",
      "In the midst of it all, medical staff under the leadership of Dr. Jamal Mohammad have been struggling to save the lives of those left wounded and starving by the war.",
      "Despite the financial support from the U.S. and other donors, they were already running out of everything from painkillers and bandages to life-saving equipment before Mr. Trump put the brakes on all U.S. foreign aid.",
      "\"I don't know what's behind that decision of President Trump, but I think it's going to increase and deepen the suffering of our people,\" he told us. \"We are the forgotten war.\"",

      "\"What we're seeing now is, I fear, going to mean a lack of respect for the United States, an undermining of U.S. interests, and certainly real negative impacts on the ground for African partners,\" she said.",
      "Lapenn argued that there had been a misrepresentation of USAID's work by officials in Washington.",
      "\"I think the debate now sort of frames USAID as if it was charity, and as if it was charity that we can't afford. And I don't think that's true on either point,\" she said. \"We know it's maybe 1% of the federal budget, so we can afford it. But at the same time, it wasn't charity. It was much more a strategic investment in U.S. relationships globally.\"",
      "Without partnerships with the U.S. some countries may have little choice but to turn elsewhere to try to fill the financial void. Some may have to resort to trading or selling off their natural resources to meet those needs.",

      "The United Nations issued a fresh appeal for emergency funding last week, seeking $6 billion to ease hunger in Sudan \u2014   40% more than the global body said was needed last year \u2014   and calling it the worst hunger catastrophe it has ever attempted to address.",
      "Cindy McCain, who heads the U.N.'s World Food Program, said over the weekend that the agency was working to provide support to some 25 million people facing hunger in Sudan, but warning that \"humanitarian services are at the brink.\"",

      "It's unclear who or what might help fill the gap left by the suspension of USAID's work, but certainly at the hospital CBS News visited, the Sudanese staff were determined to carry on as best they can.",
      "As we followed Mohammad, the head doctor at the Al Noa hospital, he stopped in one of the overcrowded wards to console 10-year-old Akram Atlan, whose leg had been shattered by shrapnel. He was playing with friends by a river when it happened. The little boy was tearful, terrified he would lose his leg and, with it, his dream of being a soccer player.",
      "But he was in good hands. Mohammad was a leading orthopedic surgeon before the war started. He lost everything when the conflict began - his home, his lucrative private practice in Khartoum, his car and his life savings. His family fled to safety in Egypt, but he stayed behind and, for nearly two years, has been running the hospital without any pay.\u00a0 He performs three to four operations on most days.",
      "As young Akram was prepped for surgery later in the day, Mohammad told us he never imagined he would be operating on the war wounded. His previous job was focused on healing broken bones and changing people's lives for the better, not grappling to keep them alive.",
      "But despite the limited resources, he still brings hope. He operated for over four hours on the little boy, repairing the broken bones and removing a large piece of shrapnel from his leg. The operation was a success, and Akram will once again be able to play soccer.",

However, the draft does not include a contentious Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv.",

      "The Vatican's update said the 88-year-old pope underwent a follow-up CAT scan Tuesday evening to check the lung infection. But it provided no details of what the scan showed, suggesting the results weren't back yet. Doctors said he hadn't had any further respiratory crises, and that his prognosis remained guarded.",
      "\"In the morning, after receiving the Eucharist, he resumed work activities,\" the Vatican statement said.",
      "Vatican sources had said the pope's condition remained the same Tuesday morning as it had been the previous evening, and that he had been able to get out of bed and eat breakfast on his own.",
      "The Vatican had said that the pope was well enough to meet with the Vatican secretary of state to approve new decrees for possible saints. That suggested he is getting essential work done and looking ahead despite being hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "The Vatican's Tuesday noon bulletin contained a series of significant decisions, most importantly that Francis had met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, the Vatican \"substitute\" or chief of staff. It was the first known time the pope had met with Parolin, who is essentially the Vatican prime minister, since his Feb. 14 hospitalization.",
      "During the audience, Francis approved decrees for two new saints and five people for beatification \u2014 the first step toward possible sainthood. Francis also decided to \"convene a consistory about the future canonizations.\"",
      "Francis regularly approves decrees from the Vatican's saint-making office when he is at the Vatican, albeit during audiences with the head of the office, not Parolin. A consistory, which is a formal meeting of cardinals, to set the dates for the canonizations is a necessary ceremonial step in that saint-making process, but the announcement of it was also forward-looking, given his illness.",
      "No date was set for the meeting. But it was also at a banal consistory to set dates for canonizations on Feb. 11, 2013, that Pope Benedict XVI announced, in Latin, that he would resign because he couldn't keep up with the rigors of the papacy. Francis has said he, too, would consider resigning after Benedict \"opened the door\" and became the first pope in 600 years to retire.",
      "In addition to the audience with Parolin, the Vatican released Francis' message for Lent, the period leading up to Easter, in yet another forward-looking sign. In a subsequent bulletin, Francis named a handful of new bishops for Brazil, a new archbishop for Vancouver and modified the law for the Vatican City State to create a new hierarchy.",
      "Many if not all of these decisions were likely in the works for some time. But the Vatican has said that Francis has been doing some work in the hospital, including signing documents.",
      "On Tuesday morning, the Vatican's typically brief morning update said: \"The pope slept well, all night.\"",
      "Doctors said Monday evening  he remained in critical condition with double pneumonia but reported a \"slight improvement\" in some laboratory results. In the most upbeat bulletin in days, they said he had resumed work from his hospital room, calling a parish in Gaza City that he's kept in touch with since the war there began.",
      "After night fell, thousands of faithful gathered in a rain-soaked, chilly St. Peter's Square for the first of a nightly recitation of the Rosary. The prayer evoked the 2005 vigils when St. John Paul II was dying in the Apostolic Palace, but those on hand said they were praying for Francis' recovery.",
      "Standing on the same stage where Francis usually presides, the Vatican secretary of state said that ever since Francis had been hospitalized, a chorus of prayers for his recovery had swelled up from around the world.",
      "\"Starting this evening, we want to unite ourselves publicly to this prayer here, in his house,\" Parolin said, praying that Francis \"in this moment of illness and trial\" would recover quickly.",
      "The Argentine pope had part of one lung removed as a young man, and doctors have said his condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease.",

The\u00a0slight kidney insufficiency detected Sunday wasn't causing alarm at the moment, doctors said, while saying his prognosis remained guarded.",
      "Still, the mood was mostly grim in the monumental square, with many of the roughly 4,000 assembled understanding they may be in Rome for Francis' final days. Crowds sat under umbrellas on folding chairs or stood by the vast colonnades as they reflected fondly on the pontiff's legacy.",
      "\"To see him suffer hurts,\" said Robert Pietro, a Romanian seminarian who stood at the prayer holding a small, fragrant candle in tribute. \"But we also pray in thanksgiving for what he has done for the Church.\"",
      "Roberto Allison, a priest from the Mexican state of Guadalajara, said members of his community had come together to show appreciation for \"all that we have learned from him.\"",
      "Stopping to deliver personal blessings to some at the end of the ceremony, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco said the crowd's diversity \u2014 many world languages could be heard spoken \u2014 was \"a big sign of comfort\" for the Catholic Church.",
      "A couple of Catholic tourists from Chicago, who arrived holding umbrellas well before the service started, said they prayed for the pope at daily Mass earlier at St. Peter's Basilica, and decided to come back. Like many, they found it \"hard to process\" they may be in Rome for Francis' final days.",
      "\"No one knows the day and time, but it's a historic moment nonetheless,\" said Edward Burjek.",
      "It felt the same for Hatzumi Villanueva of Peru. She was particularly fond of former pope St. John Paul II but said Francis, as the first Latin American pope, \"draws a bit closer.\"",
      "\"We came to pray for the pope, that he may recover soon, for the great mission he's sharing with his message of peace,\" said Villanueva, who praised his empathy for migrants.",
      "Francis' papacy has also emphasized the defense of the environment and partial openness to LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Outside the Vatican, Romans, pilgrims and even non-Catholics said they were offering special prayers for the hospitalized pope.",
      "\"We are all sorry,\" said Raniero Mancinelli, who has tailored ceremonial clothing for Francis and the two previous popes in his shop just outside the Vatican's walls.",
      "Elisabetta Zumbo carried a 5-foot-long cross down a cordoned-off section of the street leading to St. Peter's as she prepared to lead a group of 34 pilgrims from the northern Italian city of Piacenza. With the rain pouring down, she pledged her group would pray intensely for the pope.",
      "\"There is a lot of emotion and a lot of sadness,\" Zumbo said.",

      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Which day is best will depend on the location. Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York will have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March. Worldwide, the best day to see the alignment will be Feb. 28.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",

Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",

      "Israel's military operation in the occupied West Bank has now forced more than 40,000 Palestinians to flee their homes in the refugee camp towns of Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams, according to Israeli officials and the United Nations. It is the biggest displacement of civilians in the occupied West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.",
      "Over the weekend, Israel sent tanks into the northern West Bank town of Jenin for the first time in more than two decades.",
      "The Hamas-allied Islamic Jihad group, which like Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S., said Monday that the deployment of tanks after the forced displacements in the sprawling Palestinian refugee camps could be a step toward Israeli annexation of the entire West Bank.",

      "\"We go back in to get things, whatever we can. We take the risk because we have to,\" 52-year-old Jenin resident Ahmad al-Qahrawi told AFP. \"We had nothing when we left, no clothes, nothing. We go back to get clothes because it's cold.\"",
      "Israel launched a major military operation in the north of the West Bank just a few days after a fragile\u00a0ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement took hold to end 15 months of war in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, the much smaller Palestinian territory in the southwest corner of Israel. The Israel Defense Forces has said troops looking for terrorist suspects have cleared the three refugee camps, and it confirmed that tanks were deployed to Jenin.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Sunday that troops would remain for many months in the evacuated refugee camps to \"prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism.\"",

      "The damage has hampered displaced residents' \"access to basic needs such as clean water, food, medical care and shelter,\" and the winter cold \"has made it more difficult to survive,\" the Red Cross added in a statement.",

      "Israeli hardliners have long pushed for the outright annexation of the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israeli forces since 1967, but such proposals have been met with strong opposition from Palestinians and much of the international community.",
      "Violence has soared in the West Bank since Hamas triggered the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. About 1,200 people were killed in that attack and 251 others kidnapped. Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza has displaced the vast majority of that territory's population, left most of its homes and other infrastructure in ruins, and killed well over 48,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",

      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",
      "Lithium deposits, meanwhile, are scattered across Ukraine's central, east and southeast regions \u2014 the latter of which are currently held largely by Russia. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries found in everything from electric vehicles to laptops and smartphones.",
      "Ukraine also holds about 20% of the world's global reserves of graphite. Commonly used in pencils, the soft substance is also used in industrial lubricants for motors and other machinery.",
      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed the U.S. has given Ukraine $350 billion in assistance since the war started three years ago, and made it clear he wants to get that back.",
      "Ukraine Oversight, a U.S. interagency watchdog group, says the U.S. has provided no more than $183 billion, however, and roughly a third of that was spent domestically in the U.S. to manufacture ammunition and other weapons and equipment to be used by Ukraine.",

      "Police in Australia say a fisherman who fell overboard during a fishing competition on Sunday was dragged by a shark that was entangled in fishing gear.",
      "The search for Paul Barning, a figure in the New South Wales Game Fishing Association, continued Monday after authorities were alerted around 1 p.m. Sunday that the 58-year-old had fallen from his boat, Dark Horse, about 34 miles off the coast of Newcastle near Port Stephens, authorities said.",
      "Marine Area Command Commander Superintendent Joe McNulty told local news outlets on Monday that investigators believe the shark was \"quite large\" compared to Barning's 6.8-meter long vessel.",
      "\"During that process of bringing the shark alongside, he's become tangled in the fishing line, and the shark has taken off, and that fishing line was pulled taut and maybe contributed to him going over the side of the vessel. There's no evidence to say that shark has attacked the person in the water,\" McNulty said at a news conference. He added that Barning wasn't wearing a life jacket.",
      "Barning, the secretary and past president of the Port Hacking game fishing club, was a \"highly experienced game fisherman.\" He was participating in the NSWGFA Interclub State Championships at the time of the incident, the game fishing organization said in a statement posted to social media.",
      "\"This devastating accident highlights the risks involved in doing what we all love, game fishing,\" NSWGFA president Steve Lamond said in the statement. \"Please look out for each other and stay safe.\"",
      "Game fishing is a sport in which competitors catch, tag and release game fish including marlins, tunas and sharks. Points depend on the species of the game fish and their size.",
      "Among the shark species eligible for points are Blue, Smooth Hammerhead, Mako, Porbeagle, Thresher, Tiger, Great White and Whaler sharks, according to the NSWGFA rulebook. The shark that Barning caught was believed to be a Mako, police said, which can reach up to 13 feet long, according to the NOAA Fisheries.",
      "Competitors are also awarded prizes for catching the heaviest shark and catching the most sharks.",

    "summary": "The United States failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow's aggression.",
    "story": [
      "In a win for Ukraine as it marks\u00a0three years since Russia's full-scale invasion, the United States on Monday failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow's aggression. And the assembly approved a dueling European-backed Ukrainian resolution demanding Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine.",
      "It marks a setback for the Trump administration in the 193-member world body, whose resolutions are not legally binding but are seen as a barometer of world opinion. But it also shows some diminished support for Ukraine, whose resolution passed 93-18, with 65 abstentions. That's lower than previous votes, which saw over 140 nations condemn Russia's aggression.",
      "The United States had tried to pressure the Ukrainians to withdraw their resolution in favor of its proposal, according to a U.S. official and a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. They refused, and then the assembly added language to the U.S. proposal making clear that Russia invaded its smaller neighbor in violation of the U.N. Charter.",
      "The vote on the amended U.S. resolution was 93-8 with 73 abstentions, with Ukraine voting \"yes,\" the U.S. abstaining and Russia voting \"no.\"",
      "Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa said her country is exercising its \"inherent right to self-defense\" following Russia's invasion, which violates the U.N. Charter's requirement that countries respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations.",
      "\"As we mark three years of this devastation \u2014 Russia's full invasion against Ukraine \u2014 we call on all nations to stand firm and to take \u2026 the side of the Charter, the side of humanity and the side of just and lasting peace, peace through strength,\" she said.",
      "U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea, meanwhile, said multiple previous U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops \"have failed to stop the war,\" which \"has now dragged on for far too long and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine and Russia and beyond.\"",
      "\"What we need is a resolution marking the commitment from all U.N. member states to bring a durable end to the war,\" Shea said.",
      "The dueling proposals reflect the tensions that have emerged between the U.S. and Ukraine after President Trump suddenly opened negotiations with Russia in a bid to quickly resolve the conflict. It also underscores the strain in the transatlantic alliance with Europe over the Trump administration's extraordinary turnaround on engagement with Moscow. European leaders were dismayed that they and Ukraine were left out of preliminary talks last week.",
      "In escalating rhetoric, Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" falsely accused Kyiv of starting the war and warned that he \"better move fast\" to negotiate an end to the conflict or risk not having a nation to lead. Zelenskyy responded by saying Mr. Trump was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space.\"",
      "Since then, the Trump administration not only declined to endorse Ukraine's U.N. resolution, but at the last minute proposed its own competing resolution and pressed its allies to support that version instead. It comes as Mr. Trump hosted French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Washington.",
      "The U.S. also wanted a vote on its proposal in the more powerful U.N. Security Council. China, which holds the council presidency this month, has scheduled it for Monday afternoon.",
      "The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body on Ukraine because the 15-member Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has been paralyzed by Russia's veto power.",
      "There are no vetoes in the assembly, and the Ukraine resolution, which is co-sponsored by all 27 members of the European Union, is almost certain to be adopted. Its votes are closely watched as a barometer of world opinion, but the resolutions passed there are not legally binding, unlike those adopted by the Security Council.",
      "Since Russia forces stormed across the border on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Assembly has approved half a dozen resolutions that have condemned Moscow's invasion and demanded the immediate pullout of Russian troops.",
      "The votes on the rival resolutions \u2014 which have sparked intense lobbying and arm-twisting, one European diplomat said \u2014 will be closely watched to see if that support has waned and to assess the backing for Mr. Trump's effort to negotiate an end to the fighting.",
      "The very brief U.S. draft resolution acknowledges \"the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict\" and \"implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.\" It never mentions Moscow's invasion.",
      "Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters last week that the U.S. resolution was \"a good move.\"",
      "The Ukraine's resolution, meanwhile, refers to \"the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation\" and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions \"adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.\"",
      "It singles out the assembly's demand that Russia \"immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\"",
      "It stresses that any involvement of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia's forces \"raises serious concerns regarding further escalation of this conflict.\"",
      "The resolution reaffirms the assembly's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and also \"that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:09:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Friedrich Merz has vowed to prioritize European unity and the continent's security as it grapples with the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Friedrich Merz, who is on course to become post-World War II Germany's 10th chancellor after the country's election, has vowed to prioritize European unity and the continent's security as it grapples with the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "Pulling a divided Europe together won't be easy when many leaders are too preoccupied by domestic issues to devote much energy to answer the continent's most pressing problems. But expectations will be high for Merz to help fill a leadership vacuum and craft a united response to recent U.S. policy shifts that have strained the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "\"All the signals we are getting from the USA indicate that interest in Europe is clearly waning and that the willingness to get involved in Europe is decreasing,\" Merz told reporters at a press conference on Monday.",
      "\"Nevertheless, I hope that we can convince the Americans that it is in our mutual interest that we continue to have good trans-Atlantic relations.\"",
      "Merz's task will be complicated by the need to form a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He has repeatedly pledged to not work with the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party despite their second-place finish, the AfD's best result in a national election since the far-right party was founded just 12 years ago.",
      "The 69-year-old conservative leader heads the center-right Union bloc, which won Germany's national election with 28.5% of the votes.",
      "\"I am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us,\" he told supporters after his victory Sunday night. \"The world out there isn't waiting for us, and it isn't waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations.\"",
      "The top job has been late in coming for Merz, a lawyer by profession, who saw his ascent derailed by former Chancellor Angela Merkel in the early 2000s and even turned his back on active politics for several years. Despite his political experience, he is heading to the chancellery without previously having served in the federal government.",
      "Merkel has described Merz as a brilliant speaker and complimented his desire for leadership, though she acknowledged this was a problem in their relationship.",
      "\"We are almost the same age ... We grew up completely differently, which was more of an opportunity than an obstacle,\" she wrote in her memoir \"Freedom.\"",
      "\"But there was one problem, right from the start: We both wanted to be the boss,\" she said.",
      "Merkel moved to consolidate her grip on Germany's center-right after the Union narrowly lost a national election in 2002. She pushed Merz aside as leader of its parliamentary group, taking the job herself in addition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union party she already held. She went on to lead Germany from 2005 to 2021.",
      "Merz turned his back on active politics for several years after leaving the parliament in 2009.",
      "He practiced law and headed the supervisory board of investment manager BlackRock's German branch. During that break, he often travelled for business to the United States and China, though he never lived outside Germany.",
      "\"Friedrich Merz is perhaps the most international chancellor Germany has had since the war \u2014 if he becomes chancellor,\" said Volker Resing, who wrote the recently published biography \"Friedrich Merz: His Path to Power.\"",
      "Merz \"relies on personal initiative, on the freedom of the individual, on creativity and motivation. And only secondarily on the state,\" Resing said.",
      "Merz launched his political comeback after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018 and announced that she wouldn't seek a fifth term of chancellor. However, he was narrowly defeated by centrist candidates more in Merkel's mold in party leadership votes in 2018 and early 2021.",
      "Merz persisted and was elected party leader in the third attempt, after the center-right's defeat by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany's 2021 election. Merz cemented his power by also becoming the leader of the Union's parliamentary group.",
      "According to Resing, Merz's \"way of doing politics\" is not to avoid confrontation at all costs. Instead, he maintains a perspective that \"a certain amount of provocation can set off a real debate and perhaps a real development in motion.\"",
      "During the election campaign, Merz has vowed to make Germany's ailing economy strong again and curb irregular migration.",
      "With President Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Merz, who has long supported a strong trans-Atlantic relationship, said after his victory that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the United States and Russia.",
      "\"I have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\" he told supporters. \"We are under such massive pressure ... my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\"",
      "Merz will be under pressure to help solve some of Europe's most urgent problems, according to Wolfgang Merkel, a political analyst from the WBZ Berlin Social Science Center, but \"we shouldn't expect to hear one voice out of Brussels.\"",
      "\"The interests are so different within the European Union, including the political majorities, that we shouldn't expect a resounding common EU policy,\" he said and added that it will likely \"be the usual game of muddling through.\"",
      "Merz put toughening Germany's immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign after a migrant killed two people in a knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg last month.",
      "He brought a nonbinding motion before the parliament, calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. The motion was narrowly approved thanks to votes from the far-right AfD party.",
      "That prompted his opponents to accuse Merz of breaking a taboo in allegedly working with the AfD, and a public rebuke from Merkel. Critics pointed to the episode as an illustration of what they say is Merz's tendency to impulsiveness.",
      "Since then, hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest against both Merz's motion and also the rise of the far right, like the AfD, which has been placed under surveillance for suspected extremism by German intelligence.",
      "During the campaign, the AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, pledged to carry out the mass deportation of immigrants, outraging many Germans.",
      "\"We know what happened in Germany in the '30s, and it feels a bit like this is happening again, and this makes me really afraid of the future,\" one protester in Berlin said.",
      "Merz has insisted he did nothing wrong and never worked with AfD, and also repeatedly vowed to never work with the party if he becomes chancellor.",
      "Merz represents his rural region in Germany's parliament \u2014 an area where people are \"rather down-to-earth, perhaps a little reserved,\" Resing said. \"That's what shaped him: rural life.\"",
      "As a politician, Merz has always championed conservative values and stressed the importance of family.",
      "He met his wife Charlotte, who is now a judge, while he was studying law. The couple have three adult children.",
      "Merz joined the CDU in 1972 and was elected to the European Parliament in 1989. He first joined the German parliament in 1994.",
      "A pilot openly passionate about his hobby, Merz sometimes flies his own small plane from his home in the Sauerland region in western Germany to Berlin early on Monday mornings.",
      "He has stuck to flying, despite the long hours imposed by his job as opposition leader and occasional criticism that he is indulging in a rich man's hobby.",
      "\"When you talk to him about flying, his eyes light up,\" Resing said. \"He says that when you're above the clouds, that's freedom.\"",

      "\"Traditional Zambian societies and individuals believe in a strong relationship between the human world and the supernatural,\" Moyo said.",

They were found in possession of a bottled chameleon and other items including a mysterious white powder, a red cloth and an unidentified animal's tail. The men also face charges of cruelty to animals.",
      "Police said one man confessed they had been hired for a curse to kill Hichilema. He testified in court they were promised more than $1 million.",
      "The case has captured attention because many Zambians take witchcraft seriously, said Enoch Ngoma, a journalist for more than 30 years who has covered many such trials.",
      "Zambia's judiciary had said it would allow this trial to be broadcast live on television, which would have been just the second time that's happened for a trial. But it reversed the decision, citing \"stakeholders.\" Zambia's influential Council of Churches had said it was opposed to a live broadcast.",
      "When the trial opened last week, the courtroom was packed.",
      "Many traditional beliefs have survived in Zambia alongside its official Christian religion. A study by the Zambia Law Development Commission, which has a mandate to reform laws, found that 79% of Zambians believed in the existence of witchcraft as of 2018.",
      "The study was conducted because the Witchcraft Act has been questioned.",
      "It was passed in 1914 when Zambia was part of the British \"sphere of influence.\" The act defines practicing witchcraft as pretending to exercise any kind of supernatural power, witchcraft, sorcery or enchantment calculated to cause fear, annoyance or injury.",
      "Witchcraft cases have been difficult to prosecute in Zambia, with evidence tricky to collect. The cases are normally heard in traditional courts, and this is a rare one to reach the magistrates court in Lusaka. The penalty for practicing witchcraft is a fine or up to two years in jail, with the possibility of hard labor.",

      "Meanwhile, protecting against witchcraft can be good business.",
      "Rodwell Vongo, who goes by the name Dr. Vongo, is a traditional healer and president of the Zambian Traditional Healers Association. He said he would be referred to as a witch doctor under the law but calls that term derogatory.",

      "The majority of his customers are women who seek charms and spells for happy marriages, he said, but many others come looking for protection against witchcraft.",

      "Below are my current answers, based on my interpretation of the available information (which is, of course, subject to change).",
      "POPE FRANCIS\u2019 MEDICAL CONDITION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BILATERAL PNEUMONIA",
      "The pope has a long history of medical problems, including respiratory infections. Back in 1957, he had a piece of one lung removed.",
      "(Despite this, Pope Francis is not a smoker, and in fact ordered a ban on the sale of cigarettes in the Vatican\u2019s duty-free shop beginning in 2018.)",
      "Pope Francis holds the Holy Book of Prayers as he celebrates the Epiphany mass on January 6, 2020, at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.\u00a0 (Vincenzo Pinto/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The Catholic leader was last hospitalized for pneumonia in 2023. He previously underwent abdominal surgery, when part of his colon was removed.",
      "Most recently, the pope was hospitalized for a respiratory infection on Feb. 14, 2025, at Gemelli Hospital, one of the best hospitals in Italy.",
      "What is the pope's medical condition?",
      "The pope's condition has been described as bilateral pneumonia, which generally appears as consolidation on a chest x-ray or CT scan.",
      "Pneumonia is an infection in the air sacs of the lung. Bilateral pneumonia is more problematic and difficult to recover from than unilateral pneumonia or pneumonia in one lobe, especially in an elderly patient with scarring from previous surgeries and bouts of pneumonia.",
      "The pope is presumably being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is reportedly non-septic.",
      "LUNG CANCER RISING AMONG NON-SMOKERS \u2014 HERE'S WHY",
      "Though pneumonia is the most common cause of bacterial sepsis in the elderly, the statistic that one out of three cases leads to sepsis is misleading, because it refers to the period before the antibiotic era.",
      "Given that the pope has likely been given antibiotics for several days and appears to be stable, the chances of him developing sepsis are greatly reduced.",
      "What is sepsis?",
      "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition of hemodynamic compromise (where the body is not getting enough blood flow to function properly), which causes a drop in blood pressure.",
      "The condition generally causes a high fever, and heart and kidney output may decrease.",
      "\"Although the pope's prognosis is currently unknown, it doesn\u2019t sound like he is truly in critical condition.\"",
      "Often, a septic patient needs special drugs (pressors) to maintain blood pressure, and toxins and acid (lactate) can build up in the blood.",
      "Blood cultures can turn positive with a pathogen, which in this case would presumably be a bacteria.",
      "Why is the pope on oxygen?",
      "The pope is receiving what is known as high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula (a device that provides extra oxygen through a tube and into the nose), which can vary in oxygen percentage.",
      "This is a treatment for respiratory decompensation (breathing difficulties), but is not as aggressive as CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or mechanical ventilation.",
      "\"The fact that the pope is not currently on a ventilator is a good sign that he is not decompensating or septic and that his chances of recovery are possible or even probable,\" writes Dr. Marc Siegel. (Fox News)",
      "The fact that the pope is not currently on a ventilator is a good sign that he is not decompensating or septic and that his chances of recovery are possible or even probable.",
      "It is not yet clear why he needed blood transfusions (although they do improve oxygen-carrying ability) or why his platelet count was reportedly low.",
      "Reports of complications",
      "Over the weekend, on Saturday, the pope reportedly experienced an asthmatic episode, which was presumably treated with oxygen and with bronchodilators to open his airways (which constrict during an airway attack).",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "An existing asthmatic condition can be exacerbated by pneumonia. In the pope\u2019s case, it appears to have responded well to treatment.",
      "The media has also been ablaze with references to \"kidney failure,\" leading people to put that together with double pneumonia and instantly believe the pope is through.",
      "Pope Francis meets President Donald Trump in the Private Library of the Apostolic Palace at Vatican City on May 24, 2017. (Vatican/Pool/Galazka/Archivio Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori via Getty Images)",
      "While Pope Francis is certainly far from out of the woods, per Vatican reports, it is important to clarify that mild renal insufficiency simply means blood flow to the kidney is mildly reduced, perhaps from low volume or dehydration, and it might well be improving from the blood transfusions he is receiving.",
      "As long as his urine output keeps up and his kidney function doesn\u2019t worsen, this should not be a major obstacle.",
      "What is the pope's prognosis?",
      "Although the pope's prognosis is currently unknown, it doesn\u2019t sound like he is truly in critical condition, a term doctors tend to reserve for much more unstable patients.",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Morse also suggested that Wolf chronotypes sleep in cool, dark and quiet bedrooms, using blackout curtains or a sleep mask to block out early-morning light.",

      "Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., reacts to DOGE's revelation that millions of Americans aged 110-360 are still in the Social Security database and the department's imminent access to the IRS data retrieval system.",
      "I was one of the first to spit into a test tube, giving up my DNA forever to learn more about my health and heredity.\u00a0You know, the ones that promise to connect you with distant relatives you didn\u2019t even know existed or reveal genetic risks for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease. These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

      "If you do buy one of these DNA testing kits, you might expect that the results are pretty reliable. However, I was surprised to learn that this may not always be the case. According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health. Even when it comes to ethnicity and ancestry, results usually rely on statistical comparisons to reference populations, which\u00a0don\u2019t necessarily yield accurate results, especially if you\u2019re from a less-studied ethnic group.",

According to an investigative journalist who tried to have her genetic footprint wiped, it was \"brutally difficult.\" Recent events, like 23andMe going bankrupt, highlight just how precarious the situation can be.",
      "Consumers are left worried about what will happen to their genetic data if a testing company is sold or acquired, especially when they have no easy way to retrieve or destroy that data. These companies often don\u2019t disclose where and how your samples are stored, either.",
      "According to Incogni, a data broker removal service, almost none of the DNA testing services it investigated provided any information more substantial than that of a \"secure facility.\" This lack of transparency about where their data is stored and how it can be destroyed creates a major roadblock for anyone trying to regain control over their genetic information.",

      "If you\u2019re still considering using a DNA service, if your genetic information has already been exposed or if you just want to take preventative steps, here are some things to do.",
      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your DNA holds some of the most personal and sensitive information about you, and once it\u2019s out there, you lose control over how it\u2019s used. From potential privacy violations to emotional surprises and the challenges of deleting your genetic data, DNA testing kits come with risks that many don\u2019t recognize upfront. If you\u2019re considering diving into your genetic blueprint, ask yourself: Are you comfortable with this data potentially ending up in the hands of marketers, law enforcement or even a company you didn\u2019t agree to share it with?",

These are the doubts that scammers and hackers play upon to ply their trades. We're all vulnerable to tactics like these, especially if caught off guard. Older adults are particularly vulnerable.\u00a0Studies suggest that older people \u2014 who collectively lose over $28 billion to scams each year \u2014 are more likely to cling to initial impressions of trustworthiness, even when later behavior puts that trustworthiness into question. Scammers typically start their interactions with well-rehearsed, smoothly executed preambles, creating good first impressions. Older people are also more likely to put stock in good manners, finding it more difficult than younger adults to directly or indirectly question a caller's intentions, let alone cut them off mid-sentence and hang up on them.",

      "Why call center staff won't ask for personal information",
      "So, how can you know if the caller is really who they say they are? That's the question many people get stuck on. The twist? It's a red herring. The fact is, it doesn't matter if the call is legit or not. If it's a scammer, they won't be hurt or offended: rejection and hang-ups come with the territory. If it's a real call, the caller also won't be hurt or offended \u2014 here's why. Call center staff and other people who make cold calls as part of their job are aware of the privacy and security concerns that such calls bring up. They know how dangerous it can be to divulge personal information over the phone, which is why they won't ask for it. They should also be familiar with one of the best practices there is for dealing with suspicious cold calls.",
      "10 ways to safeguard against phone scams and unwanted calls",
      "1. Use the \"Hang up, look up, and call back\" method for verification: When in doubt, hang up the phone, look up the organization the caller claimed to be calling from (using its official website, for example), and call it back using the number you find there. If the call you received was above board, they'll be able to redirect you back to the initial caller.",
      "2. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: Let unknown calls go to voicemail, as legitimate callers will usually leave a message if it's important.",
      "3. Register your phone number on the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: This can help reduce telemarketing calls from legitimate businesses, but it won't stop scammers, illegal robocalls or exempt organizations (like charities and political groups) from calling you. Scammers often ignore the registry and use tactics like\u00a0number spoofing to bypass it. Want to know more about why your phone still won\u2019t stop ringing and what you can do about it? Check out our article on the\u00a0\u2018Do Not Call\u2019 list loophole.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use a spam blocking app for texts and calls:\u00a0These apps can identify and block known spam numbers, significantly reducing the number of unwanted calls you receive.",
      "5. Never give out personal information in response to unexpected calls: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive information over the phone if they've initiated the call.",
      "6. Be cautious of pressure tactics or requests for immediate action: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly or verifying their claims.",
      "7. Set a password for your voicemail account: This prevents scammers from accessing your voicemail and potentially gathering personal information.",
      "8. Be wary of caller ID\u00a0spoofing \u2014 local numbers may not be local callers: Scammers can manipulate caller ID to display any number they choose, so don't trust it blindly.",
      "9. Don't respond to questions, especially those that can be answered with \"Yes\": Scammers may record your \"Yes\" response and use it to authorize fraudulent charges or changes to your accounts.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0To get fewer of these calls in the first place, you can enlist the help of a professional data removal service. These services can take your personal information out of circulation, including the contact details spammers and scammers use to call you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's Key Takeaways",
      "If you receive a call that gives you any doubts at all, even if you can't quite put your finger on why, then you should end the call and either go on with your day or look up the company and call it back on its official number. You can reduce the number of calls like this by signing up for a data removal service. This will leave fewer spam and scam callers with your contact details and other personal information \u2014 something they use to craft convincing backstories and put potential victims at ease.",

      "In 2008, American Airlines became the first major U.S. carrier to charge for checked bags, introducing a $15 fee as part of a cost-cutting measure. Since then, other airlines have adopted similar fees, with prices steadily increasing over the years. Now, a new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",

      "The changing landscape of airline weight policies",
      "In 2013, Samoa Air introduced a \"fat tax\" where passengers paid based on their weight, but it didn't catch on widely.",
      "In February 2024, Finnair expanded its weight data collection initiative. The airline is now asking passengers to voluntarily weigh themselves along with their carry-on luggage at Helsinki Airport. This data collection will take place over three months, covering both short Schengen-area flights and longer-haul routes.",
      "Finnair's approach is designed to be anonymous, with only age, gender and travel class recorded alongside the weight data. The collected information will be used to update the airline's aircraft balance and loading calculations for the period from 2025 to 2030.",
      "These developments indicate a growing interest in the airline industry in exploring weight-based strategies for both operational efficiency and potential future pricing models.",

      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Weight-based airline pricing divides opinion",
      "A recent\u00a0study asked 1,012 U.S. adults for their opinion on charging based on weight. It looked at three pricing options: a regular fare with a set luggage limit, a \"weight threshold\" where passengers over 160 pounds would pay extra and a \"body weight\" model where ticket prices would depend on each person\u2019s weight.",
      "The results showed that lighter passengers were more in favor of weight-based fees, while heavier passengers preferred the current system. However, almost half of the heavier respondents were still open to the idea.",
      "Younger travelers, frequent flyers and wealthier passengers were more likely to support weight-based charges.",
      "The study also revealed concerns about fairness, with nearly 60% worried about possible discrimination. Despite these worries, researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.",

      "FOOD TRACKING JUST GOT LAZY WITH THIS WEARABLE",
      "Ethical and environmental implications of weight-based airline pricing",
      "The potential implementation of weight-based airline pricing extends beyond simple economics, touching on complex environmental and social justice considerations. Climate researchers suggest that such a model could significantly reduce carbon emissions by creating a more direct correlation between passenger weight and fuel consumption. Environmental experts calculate that every additional pound on an aircraft increases fuel burn, with some estimates suggesting that a reduction of 1% in total aircraft weight could lead to approximately 0.75% fuel savings.",
      "This data provides a compelling scientific argument for weight-sensitive pricing strategies. However, the approach raises critical ethical questions about body diversity, accessibility and potential discrimination. Disability advocates argue that such pricing could disproportionately impact individuals with medical conditions or physical differences beyond their control.",
      "Emerging technologies like advanced lightweight materials and more fuel-efficient aircraft designs might ultimately provide alternative solutions to reducing aviation's carbon footprint, potentially rendering weight-based pricing unnecessary in the long term. As the debate continues, the airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience.",

      "Although there's interest in weight-based charges, societal norms and the potential for discrimination make it challenging to address. As airlines continue exploring new ways to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact, it\u2019s clear that any move toward weight-based pricing will need to carefully consider fairness and public perception.",

      "Hipshipper, a shipping platform used by sellers on eBay, Shopify and Amazon, accidentally exposed millions of shipping labels with personal customer information. Researchers at Cybernews found the exposed data in December 2024, but it wasn't fixed until January, meaning it was open for at least a month. Hipshipper helps people ship packages to over 150 countries, offering tracking, free insurance and easy returns. The exposed shipping labels are important because they detail what's inside the packages and where they\u2019re supposed to go.",
      "However, an unprotected AWS bucket held over 14.3 million records, mainly shipping labels and customs forms. Researchers from Cybernews said,\u00a0\"Cybercriminals can use leaked data to carry out scams and phishing attacks. For example, criminals might pretend to be trusted businesses and send fake messages using specific order details to trick people into sharing personal or financial information.\"",

Unfortunately, retail companies are a prime target for hackers, and relying on large, well-known firms doesn\u2019t always protect your information.

These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Watch out for snail mail:\u00a0While many security threats happen online, physical mail can also be a target. With home addresses exposed in data leaks, criminals may send fraudulent letters or fake invoices to trick you into providing further personal information or making payments. If you receive suspicious mail, avoid responding and report it to the company it claims to be from.",
      "3) Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won't be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports regularly: You can request free credit reports from major credit bureaus to check for any suspicious activity or unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "6) Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "7)\u00a0Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams by removing your personal information from the web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s high time every industry took cybersecurity seriously. If your business operates online, you are just as responsible for protecting customer data as a tech company, possibly even more so, since tech companies typically have stronger safeguards in place. The fact that Hipshipper left a storage bucket containing 14 million records unprotected speaks volumes about how little they prioritize cybersecurity. And it's not just Hipshipper. Many companies dealing with tech products aren\u2019t even careful enough to password-protect their critical documents. This lack of basic security highlights a worrying trend across industries.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday muscled a multitrillion-dollar budget blueprint through the House by the narrowest of margins \u2014 a crucial step for Republicans as they embark on advancing President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.",
      "The vote was 217-215, with Republicans casting all of the votes in favor of the budget resolution. Just one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The vote came after a dramatic day of arm-twisting in the House, with Johnson hosting multiple meetings in his office to win over GOP holdouts and Trump personally calling many of those same individuals.",
      "\"We got it done,\" Johnson said after the vote. \"This is the first important step in opening up the reconciliation process. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We are going to deliver the America First agenda.\"",
      "The budget measure calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. It includes more than $100 billion in new spending on immigration enforcement and the military.",
      "It also requires the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find $880 billion in cuts to federal programs, and Republicans say some of that will come from reducing spending on Medicaid. And it raises the debt limit by $4 trillion.",
      "Three conservative rebels who had been publicly opposed to the budget framework \u2014 Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, and Warren Davidson of Ohio \u2014 ultimately flipped and voted in favor of it.",
      "\"There's no quid pro quo but the president assured me that he would work toward cuts and he's never lied to me,\" Burchett, who had expressed concern over the level of spending cuts the resolution would allow for, said after the vote. \"He's always been honest about it.\"",
      "Earlier Tuesday evening, in a chaotic moment, House Republican leaders appeared to briefly cancel the budget vote and send members home for the night, only to abruptly call up the vote and bring lawmakers back to the floor minutes later.",
      "After the vote, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., described how Trump had played an instrumental role in flipping some of the last-minute holdouts.",
      "\u201cTrump helped us with a number of members. Look, Trump has been an incredible ally in this whole process. Talking to anybody that we asked that really needed to clarify things,\u201d Scalise told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about who Trump talked to and what they talked about. I wasn\u2019t privy to those conversations.\u201d",
      "Scalise also explained what happened during a bizarre episode that left even veteran observers of the House scratching their heads.",
      "GOP leaders had spent nearly an hour on the floor trying to wrangle votes, and at one point brought holdouts into the private cloakroom for further conversations. With those rebels refusing to budge, the leaders decided to skip the budget resolution in a series of three votes that were scheduled Tuesday evening, then told lawmakers there were no more votes for the night. But as they streamed out of the Capitol, lawmakers began receiving email notifications, texts and calls that the vote was back on.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t ready yet so we went on to the third bill,\" Scalise said, \"and then still had to make sure we were there before we made the decision to call everybody back and then bring up the budget.\u201d",
      "The successful vote puts the ball back in the Senate\u2019s court. Because Trump has endorsed the House budget plan, the Senate will be under pressure to take up and pass that blueprint, even though the upper chamber adopted its own version last week.",
      "Under reconciliation, the process Republicans are using to attempt to enact Trump's policy priorities on a party-line basis, both chambers need to pass the same budget resolution before committees can officially draft the legislative package.",
      "The fate of the House's resolution was uncertain for much of the day. In addition to the small band of conservatives who cited concerns over spending levels, more moderate Republicans expressed worry over potential cuts to Medicaid. But after a full day of meetings with Johnson and after Trump himself began calling holdouts, some of them began to soften their opposition.",
      "\u201cHe was a big help, as always,\u201d a smiling Johnson said of Trump as he left the House floor.",
      "Democrats unified in opposition to the GOP budget plan, slamming it as a tax cut for the wealthy that will hurt working-class families by cutting Medicaid. They have coalesced around that political message intended to drive a wedge between Trump and swing voters, as well as his own voters who rely on federal benefits.",
      "\u201cThe House Republican budget resolution will set in motion the largest Medicaid cut in American history,\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters after the vote.",
      "Early Tuesday afternoon, the House advanced the budget resolution on a procedural vote of 217-211, which set up the final vote Tuesday evening. Four Democrats and one Republican did not vote, giving Johnson some extra breathing room.",
      "But three of the Democrats who had missed that vote and others \u2014 Reps. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, Kevin Mullin of California and Frederica Wilson of Florida \u2014 unexpectedly showed up for the final budget vote, adding an extra wrinkle for Johnson and the Republicans.",
      "Pettersen gave birth to her second child last month, while Mullin recently had knee surgery. Wilson said she had been attending to \"family matters.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, Republican Leadership denied my ability to vote remotely after giving birth to my son, Sam, but that\u2019s not stopping us from showing up to vote NO on this disastrous budget proposal,\" Pettersen posted on X, along with a photo of her with her baby.",
      "\"After 3 surgeries, a blood clot, an infection, & being hospitalized for over a week \u2014 the moment I was discharged from the hospital, I immediately rushed to the airport so I could fly to D.C. and vote NO on Republicans\u2019 disastrous budget plan,\" Mullin added on X.",
      "The House's vote Tuesday to adopt a budget blueprint is merely one step of a complicated process Republican lawmakers are undertaking to advance Trump's agenda. Both the House and Senate  must adopt the same resolution before committees can craft a massive party-line bill. The Senate voted for a different budget resolution that dealt with the border, defense and energy, while leaving taxes for a separate measure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a first step in the process,\u201d the House's tax-writing Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., told NBC News. \u201cWe did something that people didn\u2019t think we could do. We passed a budget resolution.\u201c"

The agency contracts with groups who follow up on the child\u2019s welfare, most frequently with a 30-day check-in by telephone.",
      "The sources familiar with the planning of the operation said that ICE will focus on children whose sponsors did not answer the phone on the 30-day check-in, as well as those who do not have court dates.",
      "Republicans, including President Donald Trump, repeatedly criticized the Biden administration for what they said were \u201cmissing children\u201d who crossed the border without parents and were released without notices to appear in court. To relieve overcrowding in HHS refugee resettlement facilities, the Biden and first Trump administrations sometimes released children before they were given court dates.",
      "According to an August 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general, more than 291,000 children who crossed the border since fiscal year 2019, which included the first Trump administration, were not given notices to appear in court.",
      "An NBC News review of HHS data revealed\u00a0that areas of the country with large populations of migrant children who were sent to live with sponsors vetted by the Office of Refugee Resettlement include Maricopa County, Arizona; Los Angeles County, California; Miami-Dade County, Florida; and Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.",
      "Mellissa Harper, a former ICE official, now heads the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Trump administration.\u00a0The office previously assured sponsors that they could come forward to claim children and that they could answer check-in calls without the fear that their information would be shared with ICE.",
      "Under the current administration, there is no such wall barring that information sharing, the officials said.",
      "An attorney who represents unaccompanied children in immigration court told NBC News on the condition of anonymity that the immigration system could be further overwhelmed with more children on the docket. They noted that Trump has already cut legal aid services to unaccompanied children, so adding more cases could mean more children without representation in immigration court.",
      "\u201cThe legal services [for migrant children] is not just to be nice to kids, it\u2019s to make sure the system works. They need to resource the system if they move more into NTA,\u201d the attorney warned, referring to a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d in court."

      "Trump suggested an openness Monday to an agreement with Russia.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do some economic development deals. They have a lot of things that we want,\u201d Trump told reporters, referring to Russia. \u201cYou know, they have massive rare earth. It\u2019s ... very large. ...",
      "\u201cIf we could do that, I think it would be a very good thing for world peace and lasting peace,\u201d Trump added. \u201cJust as we\u2019re doing with Ukraine, if we could do some economic development in terms of Russia and getting things that we want, something like that would be possible.\u201d",

      "Responding to U.S. negotiations with Ukraine over a possible agreement to share revenues from the country\u2019s mineral resources, Putin said that such a deal would not be cause for concern and that Russia had \u201csignificantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine.\u201d He also said his government and the United States could collaborate on aluminum extraction and supply.",

      "The meeting in Saudi Arabia was attended by Secretary of State Marco Rubio; national security adviser Mike Waltz; the Trump administration\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff; Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov; and close Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov.",
      "Russia proposed a new economic partnership to the U.S. officials that would involve territory that Moscow seized in its 2022 invasion of Ukraine and that would coincide with the end of the war, the U.S. officials and the person briefed on the proposal said.",
      "It would effectively ensure that Russia would retain swaths of Ukrainian territory that it occupies and hopes to keep as part of a negotiated peace deal. It also is designed to appeal to Trump\u2019s pursuit of a financial cut for the United States in a negotiated end to the war. Trump has pushed for Ukraine to agree to give the United States $500 billion worth of its rare earth minerals, proposing that the two countries split ownership of the minerals evenly, NBC News has reported.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:36:32 GMT",
    "summary": "As a measles outbreak sweeps through Texas, anti-vaccine groups are pushing a familiar and false theory: The virus is being caused by the vaccine itself.",
    "story": [
      "As a measles outbreak sweeps through Texas, officially sickening 124 people, mostly unvaccinated children, and hospitalizing 18, anti-vaccine groups are pushing a familiar and false theory: The highly contagious virus is being caused by the vaccine itself.",
      "\u201cThe narrative is that it\u2019s a failure to vaccinate when we know it is a failing vaccine,\u201d said Sayer Ji, a self-described natural health and wellness thought leader who is not a doctor. He outlined his theory Monday during an interview on the internet morning show from Children\u2019s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit formerly led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who resigned after being chosen by President Donald Trump to run the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Ji\u2019s discussion with Children\u2019s Health Defense\u2019s director of programming, Polly Tommey, comes as Texas health authorities work to contain an outbreak of one of the world\u2019s most contagious diseases, in part through a campaign to vaccinate residents. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot is remarkably safe and effective, experts said, and the mild reaction that some people experience after receiving it is unlikely to be confused with measles.",
      "But that has not stopped Ji, Tommey and a growing chorus of state \u201chealth freedom\u201d groups and conspiracy theory websites from pushing the false claims. They\u2019ve also argued the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be testing to determine the difference between these theorized vaccine-caused cases and naturally occurring wild-type measles. And they\u2019ve suggested the tests weren\u2019t being done as part of a wider conspiracy or \u201cpsychological operation\u201d against Kennedy.",
      "\u201cIt is no coincidence in my mind that Bobby gets confirmed to be secretary of HHS, and immediately we have a measles outbreak,\u201d said Tommey, who is the mother of an adult child whom she says was injured by the MMR vaccine. \u201cParent to parent, do not go anywhere near that vaccine.\u201d",
      "In fact, the Texas Department of State Health Services is genotype testing measles samples for surveillance purposes. All samples tested in the outbreak have come back as genotype D8, a known strain of the wild measles viruses \u2014 not the vaccine, said Lara Anton, senior press officer at the department.",
      "Testing \u201chelps us determine if cases are related\u201d to each other, Anton said. \u201cIt also helps us know whether a positive measles test for someone who was recently immunized is due to an actual infection or to a reaction to the vaccine.\u201d",
      "The fears about the measles vaccine are ungrounded, said Dr. Matthew Washam, director of epidemiology at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who co-authored a paper about vaccine shedding\u00a0\u2014 when a vaccine releases parts of a virus, stimulating an immune response, and sometimes causes symptoms of a disease, but not the disease itself. Ji\u00a0inaccurately cited the paper on his blog as evidence for his unsupported theory.",
      "\u201cNo, the MMR vaccine does not cause measles infection,\u201d said Washam.",
      "While an MMR vaccine can sometimes induce mild and temporary reactions such as a low-grade fever and rash, actual measles infections are more severe and can be deadly \u2014 they often come with high fevers, a full-body rash, ear infections, dehydration and pneumonia \u2014 and are linked to direct exposure, not the vaccine. It\u2019s unlikely for the two to be confused, Washam said.",
      "\u201cThis is a completely different phenomena,\u201d Washam said. \u201cIt\u2019s the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine. It\u2019s not wild-type measles infection. Most importantly, it\u2019s not transmissible to others, and it\u2019s not a cause of an outbreak.\u201d",
      "There has never been a documented case of the MMR vaccine causing a measles infection that spread to others, Washam said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely great vaccine.\u201d",
      "He called the safety and efficacy of the measles vaccine \u201ctruly remarkable\u201d and stressed its importance, especially for young children.",
      "Though the symptoms for measles can sound mild, complications can be dangerous and even deadly. Out of every 1,000 cases, around 200 children require hospitalization, 50 develop pneumonia, one experiences brain swelling that can lead to deafness or disability, and between one and three die.",
      "The theories espoused about Texas echo Kennedy\u2019s false statements about the measles outbreak in Samoa in 2019. That fall, as young children were hospitalized and dying from measles infections, Kennedy wrote to the Pacific Island nation\u2019s prime minister, warning about the possible danger of the vaccine campaign. \u201cNobody died in Samoa from measles,\u201d he told an interviewer last August. \u201cThey were dying from a bad vaccine.\u201d",
      "Kennedy has not commented on the Texas outbreak since being confirmed as HHS secretary this month, but some of his early moves \u2014 including the shelving of planned ads for the flu vaccine and the postponement of a meeting of a vaccine advisory panel \u2014 have concerned public health experts.",
      "He has previously downplayed the danger of measles, a common tactic of the anti-vaccine movement and a line of argument that Ji and Tommey repeated this week on the Children\u2019s Health Defense show. They falsely theorized that the supposed vaccine measles strain was potentially more dangerous than so-called natural measles, which Ji said without evidence came with benefits to the immune system and reduced the risk of certain cancers.",
      "For years, activists like Kennedy have suggested that the tens of thousands of children who were hospitalized and the hundreds who died each year from measles before vaccines were available are inconsequential when compared to the countless individuals who they claim \u2014 without evidence \u2014 have been harmed by the MMR vaccine. But when outbreaks occur, the narrative often shifts from minimizing measles to reviving the persistent anti-vaccine myth: that the MMR vaccine can shed and cause outbreaks.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s 2019 letter to Samoa\u2019s leader referenced another outbreak, which started in California\u2019s Disneyland in 2015 and spread to seven U.S. states, Mexico and Canada and sickened over 100 people. Kennedy claimed the outbreak was likely caused by vaccines \u2014 contrary to evidence that showed low vaccination rates as the culprit. The false theory seems to stem from a misreading of a California Department of Public Health report that mentioned cases of a vaccine-induced rash, not vaccine-induced measles.",
      "HHS and the CDC did not respond to requests for comment. Tommey did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "In an email, Ji disputed the experts\u2019 opinions, calling them \u201can oversimplification that lacks conclusive scientific verification in the absence of proper genotyping,\u201d and suggested a reporter consult a different report on vaccine shedding published by an anti-vaccine organization.",
      "To Washam, the difference between measles and the MMR vaccine is the risk one is willing to take \u2014 especially for young children \u2014 to get immunity from measles.",
      "\u201cWere you given a very safe and effective MMR vaccine and therefore have immunity against measles?\u201d he said. \u201cOr did you have to survive wild-type infection, which can be a very severe infection, especially in young children?\u201d",
      "For now, the conspiracy theory appears confined to the internet and hasn\u2019t yet taken root in the communities where measles is spreading, according to Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock who has treated several exposed families. Montanez said vaccine hesitancy there is currently driven by limited education, cultural isolation in the Mennonite community and a perceived lack of necessity.",
      "\u201cA lot of our parents are actually really open to asking questions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not misinformation about the vaccine causing outbreaks that\u2019s the issue here. It\u2019s more about, \u2018Why should we vaccinate if we\u2019ve never seen this disease?\u2019\u201d"

      "An unnamed woman purchased one of the puppies from a street vender in north Denver for $1,500, the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a post on X on Tuesday. The woman then returned the dog after realizing it matched the description of one of the stolen pups in news articles, authorities said.",
      "\"She immediately called the store when she recognized her puppy matched the photos in the story,\" the sheriff's office wrote. \"Perfect Pets is grateful for being reunited with the dog and plans to give her a reward.\"",
      "The trio of thieves walked into the store within several minutes of one another on Friday, looked around and inquired about the 11-month-old bulldogs, authorities said in a statement on Monday. One of them then began to fake a seizure to distract employees, while another grabbed the two bulldogs, authorities said.",
      "An employee tackled the suspect who grabbed the two dogs, authorities said, but the he managed to escape with the puppies. The two men got away in a gold Cadillac Escalade with chrome wheels, authorities said. The SUV was driven by a fourth suspect who is believed to be female, authorities added.",
      "The man who authorities said faked a seizure was identified as Timothy Davis, 37.\u00a0Davis was apprehended by law enforcement officers who responded to the scene and was charged with conspiracy to commit a felony, theft and drug possession. Davis was behind bars based on $2,500 bond, with an initial court date scheduled for Thursday, according to jail records.",
      "It is unclear if Davis has legal representation. A spokesperson for the Arapahoe District Attorney's Office did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office told NBC News in a phone call on Tuesday that they have not made any new arrests. The spokesperson added that the second puppy has not been found as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Jens Larsen, who owns the pet store, said in a phone call that the returned puppy is \"doing well.\"",
      "\"Puppies are pretty resilient. He's doing OK. Doesn't look like he had any physical harm, he doesn't have any scars on him or anything like that,\" Larsen said. \"Looks like he's missing his little brother. We're still trying to get him back.\"",
      "Larsen said that two additional puppies were stolen from the store on Feb. 12 by a woman carrying a baby and another woman pushing a stroller. One of the woman told Larsen she was purchasing hamsters for a niece and nephew as a distraction to take a shih tzu valued at more than $2,000, Larsen said.",
      "Three months prior to that, another puppy was stolen from the store, he added."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans are becoming weary and wary of in-person town hall meetings after a number of lawmakers have faced hometown crowds angry about the Trump administration\u2019s push to slash government programs and staffing.",
      "Party leaders suggest that if lawmakers feel the need to hold such events, they do tele-town halls or at least vet attendees to avoid scenes that become viral clips, according to GOP sources.",
      "A GOP aide said House Republican leaders are urging lawmakers to stop engaging in them altogether.",
      "The town halls, and the rash of negative headlines, have been the first bit of public blowback for members who face voters next year. And the new reluctance to hold them indicates there are bubbling concerns about the impact the cuts could have on the GOP's chances of holding its thin majority in the House next year.",
      "The viral nature of video clips spreading from one district to another means a bad confrontation in safe Republican territory could influence voters in battlegrounds.",
      "The GOP-led House is trying to enact even deeper spending and tax cuts through legislation that could add as much as $4.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. But much of the tension focused on billionaire Elon Musk, the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to unilaterally eliminate jobs, contracts and grants. Musk, who is a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d advising Trump, did not require Senate confirmation to take his temporary post.",

Elon Musk\u2019s work still has the administration\u2019s support, period.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, White House and party officials say the majority of the public wants the budget cuts.",
      "\"The president's policies are incredibly popular, and the American people applaud his success in cutting the waste, fraud and abuse of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars,\" said Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser at the RNC. \"Pathetic astroturf campaigns organized by out-of-touch, far-left groups are exactly why Democrats will keep losing.\"",

      "A chief of staff to a House Republican who has won handily compared the dynamics with tough town halls in the 2018 midterms. While Democrats won control of the House that year, GOP lawmakers in Republican-heavy districts may have benefited from a backlash to the criticism.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 2018 all over again,\u201d the aide said. \u201cThe town halls, if anything, helped in districts like ours.\u201d"

    "summary": "A lawsuit claims a SWAT team stormed into the wrong Denver apartment while looking for a suspect, traumatizing children despite knowing the man they were looking for lived in another unit.",
    "story": [
      "DENVER \u2014 Kirsty Shelton was at home preparing lunch and watching television with her daughters and their grandmother when they were startled by loud banging on their apartment door by a SWAT team looking for a man who lived across the hall.",
      "Shelton\u2019s mother told them they had the wrong apartment but, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the Denver officers, she and her daughter were ordered outside at gunpoint.",
      "When the officers then entered the apartment, they encountered two girls, ages 5 and 6, in their bedroom. According to the body camera footage of the June 2023 incident, an officer told them they could play there and that he would get their grandmother, but the girls began to scream.",
      "Police then put the family, including another adult who had just gotten out of the shower, into a locked police car for about an hour and took over their apartment as they continued to search for the suspect, according to the lawsuit. It says police knew the man they were looking for lived in apartment 307, not 306 where the Shelton family lived, and that the numbers were clearly marked. It claims police didn\u2019t admit to making a mistake but instead denied the raid ever happened.",
      "The operation\u2019s commander wrote in an after-action report that, due to the layout of the apartment building, the family was \u201ccontacted, advised of the situation and evacuated for their own safety,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Shelton said the police officers\u2019 actions traumatized her family and required them to get extensive counseling.",
      "\u201cThe police promised an investigation but instead covered up the raid, failing to produce their report to this day, over a year and a half after the incident. They continue to pretend that this terrifying raid never happened,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Denver police declined to comment due to the pending litigation as well as an ongoing internal investigation.",
      "Two of the Shelton family\u2019s lawyers, John Holland and Dan Weiss, said some reports by individual officers failed to mention that they even went into the family\u2019s apartment as they searched for a suspect who was wanted for serious violent crimes. The man was arrested hours later in the apartment directly opposite theirs, the lawsuit says.",
      "Holland and Weiss filed the lawsuit in state court under Colorado\u2019s 2020 police reform law, which does not allow officers to try to block lawsuits under the claim of qualified immunity, as they can in federal court. It alleges that at least 10 officers violated the family\u2019s constitutional right to be free of unlawful searches and seizures, and that the family was subjected to excessive force.",
      "Last year, a 78-year-old woman whose Denver home was wrongly searched by a SWAT team looking for a stolen truck won a $3.76 million verdict. The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, which helped represent her, said police got a search warrant for the home after the owner of the truck \u2014 which had four semiautomatic handguns, a rifle, a revolver, two drones, $4,000 cash and an iPhone inside \u2014 tracked the phone to the home using the Find My app, and passed that information on to police.",
      "It\u2019s rare for SWAT teams to enter the wrong location, said Thor Eells, a former SWAT member and commander for the Colorado Springs Police Department and the executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association. Nationally, instances of tactical teams going into wrong locations has significantly decreased in the last decade mainly because of better training and a move away from hasty drug-related operations, he said.",
      "But when police do make a mistake and suspect they\u2019ve entered the wrong location, they can\u2019t immediately just back away because the location needs to be searched to make sure there are no threats, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce they start the entry, they\u2019re not going to stop until they secure the apartment for the safety of everyone involved,\u201d said Eells, who declined to comment on the Denver case.",
      "Experts in tactical operations say sending a SWAT team to arrest someone in an apartment building is challenging because people move in and out frequently, unit numbers can be unclear and gunshots can pass into another unit.",
      "When time allows, officers can do surveillance, get the target location\u2019s floor plans and send someone to check it out before an operation, said Mark Lomax, former executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired major for the Pennsylvania State Police."

      "Having spent 15 years on \u201cAs The World Turns\u201d earlier in her career, Tunie is no stranger to soap operas. But once \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d began filming, Tunie instantly knew the experience would be unique, especially since she\u2019d grown accustomed to often being the only Black person in a cast.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult being the only one, no matter how well you navigate it. So, to walk into a space where there are multitudes is a relief because when you\u2019re only one, you feel like you have the responsibility. But when there are multitudes, it\u2019s shared and it\u2019s a lighter weight,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d is making history as the first-ever one-hour Black daytime soap opera and the first daytime drama since \u201cPassions,\u201d which premiered in 1999.",
      "But Tunie and her co-stars make one thing abundantly clear while chatting with TODAY.com ahead of the series premiere: This show is for everyone.",
      "\u201cYou have not just the Black family, but you have white people, you have Asian people, you have Hispanic people.\u00a0You have a gay couple.\u00a0Everybody\u2019s represented in this show,\u201d Tunie says.",
      "Daphn\u00e9e Duplaix, who plays Dr. Nicole Dupree Richardson on the drama, echoes her co-star's sentiments while explaining why the show's timing is just right.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, there is no race.\u00a0We are the human race.\u00a0Our stories are the same.\u00a0Our struggles might have been different, but our stories are the same. It\u2019s a universal show,\u201d she says.",
      "About \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d",
      "Like other soap operas, the daytime series is chock-full of juicy intrigue, romance and complicated family relationships.",
      "Set in Fairmont\u00a0Crest, \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d is an exclusive gated community in Maryland where multiple generations of the wealthy Dupree family reside.",
      "Vernon and Anita Dupree (Clifton Davis and Tamara Tunie) are the patriarch and matriarch of the successful family, which includes their two daughters Dani (Karla Mosley) and Nicole (Daphn\u00e9e Duplaix) and four grandchildren. The Duprees are basically Black royalty and their reputation precedes them around town.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of drama at the center of the series premiere, which introduces viewers to the Duprees as they navigate a rather delicate situation: the wedding of Dani\u2019s ex-husband Bill (Timon Kyle Durrett). In true soap opera fashion, the story behind Bill\u2019s upcoming nuptials is quite scandalous.",
      "As it turns out, Bill cheated on Dani with their daughter Naomi\u2019s (Arielle Prepetit) best friend, Hayley (Marquita Goings). The pair hit it off, leading to the dissolution of Bill and Dani\u2019s marriage.",
      "Like any tight-knit crew, the Duprees stick together and support each other through ups and downs, so the family unites to face this latest challenge together.",
      "From 'Generations' to 'Beyond the Gates'",
      "Before \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d a half-hour NBC series called \u201cGenerations\u201d made history as the first soap opera to feature a Black family at the forefront of the show alongside a white family. The show premiered in 1989 and ended in 1991.",
      "Clifton Davis, who plays the Dupree family's patriarch, Vernon, on \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d recalls watching a few episodes of \u201cGenerations\u201d to witness his Broadway co-star Jonelle Allen in action on the small screen.",
      "\u201cThat was a half-hour show.\u00a0This is an hour-long show with the primary family being African American.\u00a0That\u2019s a long way to come from \u2018Generations,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "In the years since \u201cGenerations\u201d ended its two-season run on NBC, African American actors have played critical roles in a plethora of daytime soap operas.",
      "Kristoff St. John, who starred in \u201cGenerations,\u201d went on to build a wildly successful career on \u201cThe Young and the Restless\u201d as the head of the Winters family. He joined a host of Black stars who left their mark on the soap industry, including Debbi Morgan, Shemar Moore, Victoria Rowell, and countless others.",
      "Karla Mosley hadn\u2019t watched \u201cGenerations\u201d until she landed the role of Dani Dupree on \u201cBeyond the Gates.\u201d But when she did, she saw a few familiar faces, including St. John, who she worked with before his death in 2019.",
      "Watching \"Generations\" while preparing for her role in \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d was inspiring for Mosley, who has appeared in several soap operas throughout her career, including \u201cThe Young and the Restless,\u201d \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cGuiding Light.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt emboldens and empowers me in my performance today.\u00a0I feel like I\u2019m standing on their shoulders,\u201d she says.",
      "Davis, 79, honed his acting career during a period where roles for Black performers were few and far between.",
      "\u201cWhen I got in television in the early \u201870s, Melvin Moore and I were the first African American couple to host a variety show on network television, so that was historic.\u00a0Trust me, there were no Black faces behind the scenes. It was just us.\u00a0And if there were Black faces, it was because we invited them to be a part of the show,\u201d he recalls.",
      "Looking back on this experience and comparing it to his time filming \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d thus far, Davis can't help but marvel at how the industry has shifted toward a more inclusive one.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t Black producers. There weren\u2019t Black writers. There weren\u2019t Black cameramen.\u00a0There weren\u2019t Black lighting people. But here we are in another dimension in 2025, where \u2018Beyond the Gates\u2019 has all of the above ...\u00a0I think we\u2019ve come a mighty, mighty, mighty long way, and in my 50 some years of television, this is darn amazing,\" he says.",
      "A new era of daytime TV",
      "When Duplaix auditioned for \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d she was excited for the project. But it wasn't until she landed the role of Nicole that she started to realize what the show would mean to her and its future audience.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m laying in bed and I woke up. I\u2019m staring at the ceiling and it just hit me. I was like, \u2018Whoa, this is huge.\u00a0This is groundbreaking,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201c(I suddenly understood) the weight that we\u2019re going to be carrying for everyone.\u00a0And that\u2019s when I got a little nervous.\u201d",
      "Luckily, Duplaix wouldn't have to go it alone. She soon witnessed the extensive support system she'd have on set from her castmates, show creator Michele Val Jean, and executive producers Julie Carruthers and Sheila Ducksworth.",
      "Val Jean previously worked as a writer for \u201cGenerations\u201d and has had a successful career with multiple soap opera writing credits, including \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cGeneral Hospital.\u201d",
      "In an \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d special titled \u201cBeyond the Gates: Welcome to the Neighborhood,\u201d Ducksworth spoke to the significance of her and Val Jean's partnership on the show.",
      "\u201cWe're the two first Black female executive producers in daytime television for a soap opera,\u201d she said.",
      "The powerhouse producers, who have known each other over 20 years, also gave some insight into how the show came to be. Ducksworth, a longtime soap opera fan, said she\u2019s always wanted to make a soap opera that was \u201creflective of people that I knew.\u201d",
      "\"Sheila said she wanted to make the soap about a family that lived in a gated community, so I just started thinking about characters and how to populate it and who they were and how they connected,\" Val Jean said.",
      "\u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d prioritizes representation in front of the camera, but the series has also made diversity a priority behind the scenes with its crew.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s comforting when you walk into a building and you know people understand you and they understand how to light you and they understand how to do your hair and you don\u2019t have to explain anything,\u201d Duplaix says.",
      "The diversity on set also helps fuel the actors' performances.",
      "\u201cI'm realizing that part of the reason I\u2019m able to play Dani with such freedom and bravery is because I feel so safe in this environment,\u201d Mosley explains.",
      "From writers and wardrobe stylists to makeup artists and hairstylists, each member of the crew is focused on making the show as authentic as possible and making the cast feel comfortable.",
      "\u201c(It\u2019s nice) coming in not having to worry about my hair and\u00a0if someone\u2019s gonna be able to know how to do it or not, not having to worry about my makeup, not having to worry about my clothes ... All of those things are elements that I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been\u00a0concerned about in the past that I don\u2019t have to think about now and that just makes the job so much easier,\u201d Mosley says.",
      "'Beyond the Gates:' History in the making",
      "While \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d is making history as the first series of its kind, Duplaix hopes the show\u2019s premiere is also significant for the soap opera industry in general.",
      "\u201cI keep saying, \u2018We\u2019re the first, but I surely hope we\u2019re not the last.\u2019\u00a0We\u2019re not reinventing the soap wheel; we\u2019re just making it better.\u00a0Hopefully, next year there\u2019s another new show and the year after that\u00a0so we can rebuild daytime television,\u201d she says.",
      "Several of the stars of \u201cBeyond the Gates\u201d have extensive experience in the soap opera realm, but joining a show at its inception is a pretty rare feat.",
      "\u201cThe other soaps have been on for decades, so you\u2019re jumping on a moving train.\u00a0We\u2019re at the beginning before the train leaves the station and the kind of impact that you can have in establishing the world is really special, and I\u2019m loving being a part of that,\u201d Tunie says.",
      "When Mosley first heard about \u201cBeyond the Gates,\u201d she thought the series was a no brainer. \u201cAt a time where there\u2019s a lot of division in our country and in our world, this can be a place where there\u2019s both entertainment and joy,\u201d she says.",
      "While discussing the significance of the show, Tunie reflects on the importance of representation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going away and we\u2019re not hiding our light. We\u2019re shining our light brightly, and this show does that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt shines the light very brightly.\u201d",

      "Duplaix on her character: \u201cI actually wanted to be Dani Dupree because I knew she was feisty, fiery and she wore her feelings on the outside.

We don\u2019t land on it, but we brush by a little bit of that history and so it\u2019s not left out,\u201d he says."

    "summary": "What Glory Edim, the founder of Well Read Black Girl, recommends books centering Black women's stories.",
    "story": [
      "Glory Edim founded Well Read Black Girl in 2015 with a mission of connectivity. Books, she says, were a tool for \u201chealing and empowerment\u201d in her life.",
      "In Well Read Black Girl, she wanted to create a \u201cliterary home\u201d for other Black women where they could see themselves reflected, honored and uplifted.",
      "\u201cWhether you're a reader or a writer, you can see yourself on the pages of a book in a beautiful reflective way,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are so many other places where Black personhood is not valued, but this space is not that. It's something where it's just carefully considered love and cultivated.\u201d",
      "The club has chosen over 100 books by Black women and built a virtual community of over 400,000 readers.  The club's virtual meetings are a place for readers and writers to \"vent, find solace and mobilize\" \u2014 a type of \"community-driven storytelling,\" she says.",
      "In the nearly 10 years since its founding, Well Read Black Girl has also launched a podcast, newsletter, multiple book festivals and books of its own \u2014 Edim wrote about the books that \u201csaved her\u201d in her memoir, \u201cGather Me\u201d and curated the \u201cWell Read Black Girl\u201d essay series.",
      "The brand's next project is a line of books produced in partnership with Liveright, an imprint of W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. The first book in the series is Yrsa Daly-Ward\u2019s fiction debut, \u201cThe Catch.\u201d",
      "\"Gather Me\" by Glory Edim",
      "The project has been five years in the making as Edim transitions from writer and reader to editor. \u201c(Editing) fiction was a learning curve for me \u2013 it was just a different part of my brain. It's been wild but it's been such an incredible experience,\u201d she says.",
      "It's fitting that she's moving into working directly with authors, as Edim has always been mindful of how authors feel when their books are chosen (you can view a full list on their website). Edim says from the beginning, she's been committed to aligning with authors to make sure their story is told they way they want it to be shared.",
      "\u201cBecoming an author is so, so vulnerable and scary. I love that Well Read Black Girl allows a space of comfort \u2014\u00a0but we're also celebrating the rich storytelling tradition of Black culture,\u201d she says.",
      "Below, Edim shares a list she says highlights Black women\u2019s contributions to literature across genres, from memoirs to speculative fiction.",
      "\"Grown Women\" by Sarai Johnson",
      "\u201cSarai Johnson\u2019s debut book is a fresh, fearless take on what it means to be a grown Black woman in today\u2019s world,\u201d Edim says. \u201cIt\u2019s giving wisdom, self-discovery, and sisterhood. I loved her dynamic characters and the way she illustrates how complicated, sophisticated Black women navigate adulthood.\u201d",
      "\"Black in Blues\" by Imani Perry",
      "\u201cScholar Imani Perry is a brilliant storyteller and cultural critic. 'Black in Blues' offers a historical analysis of Black identity through the lens of color. She examines how the color blue beautifully reflects the Black lived experience in America,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"The Catch\" by Yrsa Daley-Ward",
      "\u201cYrsa Daley-Ward is back with another gut-punch of a book, and this time, it's an intoxicating story about love, longing, and self-discovery. If you love messy, complicated, deliciously emotional stories, this one\u2019s calling your name,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"Beloved\" by Toni Morrison",
      "\u201cThe essential classic. Morrison\u2019s masterpiece is haunting, poetic, and unforgettable. I constantly recommend this title to anyone interested in understanding Morrison\u2019s profound literary legacy,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"We Refuse\" by Kellie Carter Jackson",
      "\u201cThis book brings the fire and will spark your inner activist! It reclaims Black resistance as an act of love and power \u2014 perfect for understanding the complexity and nuance of Black activist movements,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"Men We Reaped\" by Jesmyn Ward",
      "\u201cA gut-wrenching, beautiful memoir about grief and survival. Jesmyn Ward tells the stories of five young Black men \u2014 friends, family, and community members \u2014 who died too soon in her hometown in Mississippi, including her own beloved brother. It\u2019s heartbreaking but also beautifully written. Her writing will stay with you long after you turn the last page,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"Unbound\" by Tarana Burke",
      "\u201cWe all know Tarana Burke as the powerhouse behind the #MeToo movement, but 'Unbound' is her story \u2014 raw, real, and deeply moving. She takes us through her own journey of survival and activism, showing how her personal experiences shaped the movement that changed the world. This isn\u2019t just a book about a hashtag; it\u2019s about resilience and the power of speaking your truth,\u201d Edim says.",
      "\"Seven Days in June\" by Tia Williams",
      "\u201cOver the course of seven days, Eva and Shane confront their painful past, revealing the deep love, trauma, and misunderstandings that shaped their complex lives. As they navigate their second chance at love, they must decide whether they can overcome their past wounds and truly be together. Who says Black History Month can\u2019t be sexy and romantic?\u201d",
      "\"Red at the Bone\" by Jacqueline Woodson",
      "\u201cTold through multiple perspectives and shifting timelines, \u2018Red at the Bone\u2019 explores the effects of history, love, and generational choices on one Black family in Brooklyn. Woodson\u2019s prose is like poetry \u2014 simple yet profound,\u201d Edim says."

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 16:36:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Do the White Lotus opening credits art predict the characters' fates? An art historian thinks so and reads into what it all means.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"The White Lotus\" Season Three.",
      "The opening credits of \"The White Lotus\" Season 3 might give away more information than just the cast and crew's names. Fans think the art has clues into the characters\u2019 fates \u2014 and some of the actors this season do, too.",
      "Jason Isaacs, who plays father of three and businessman Timothy Ratliff in the third season of the hit HBO show, brought up the meaning behind the opening credits this season in an interview with some of his castmates aired on TODAY on Feb. 12.",
      "\"Someone said to Patrick (Schwarzenegger) and I the other day that during the credits when each individual name comes up, did you notice that the drawing behind it means something about their character?\" Isaacs asked.",
      "Sarah Catherine Hook, who plays Tim's middle child Piper in the show, said the illustration accompanying her name directly corresponded with her character.",
      "\"Mine was meditating,\" Hook said. \"I was like, 'That's Piper.'\"",
      "Isaacs started laughing and replied, \"We didn't notice any of this at all.\"",
      "While the cast of the \"White Lotus\" are aware of what the illustrations could mean (or could not mean), fans have began posting their own theories on social media.",
      "One TikTok, which has more than 350,000 views, offered five minutes of analysis of the opening credits, from character illustrations to how Season Three's credits could connect to the credits (and plot lines) from Season One.",
      "Kelly Cahn, an art advisor, curator and appraiser, shared more insights about the opening credits in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\"I feel like they're literally showing us the entire thing in advance,\" Cahn said of the opening images.",
      "The 'White Lotus' Season 3 credits, analyzed by an art expert",
      "The paintings shown in the opening credits are inspired by Thai mural paintings, which can be found in temples and royal palaces in Thailand, Cahn said.",
      "She noted that several paintings throughout the credits, including the one featured in the first few seconds, appear to be on top of panel that is behind the ones that are visible, meaning we might not be seeing the full, bigger picture.",
      "\"Like, there's some story that's a cover up or something,\" Cahn said.",
      "The first actor's name to appear is Leslie Bibb. The letters are surrounded by an illustration of several elephants \u2014 creatures known for having a remarkable memory.",
      "Cahn said at first she saw three elephants \u2014 which could correspond to the trio Bibb's character is with on the trip \u2014 but then could potentially see four, possibly hinting at more to come for their group.",
      "The illustration for Carrie Coon, who plays another one of the three women on vacation together, also features an elephant, though it's surrounded by a pack of animals as two winged creatures look on from above.",
      "\"There's almost a sense of you're being watched,\" Cahn says of the painting. \"Are these things that can fly away and report back? Again, it feels like an attack. Lying in wait, watching.\"",
      "Walton Goggins is the next name to appear after imagery of a palace or temple. His illustration shows a man sitting in a tower looking down below, which Cahn said could hint at his surveillance of the owners of the hotel.",
      "As Hook said on TODAY, her name is shown with a woman who appears to be meditating on a hill, and her character Piper is a Buddhist.",
      "Before Isaacs' name is alongside a man hiding in a tree (\"perhaps from the incriminating press,\" Cahn said). Above him in the tree are hanging knives or swords \u2014 which could be a sign of incoming danger for the father of three, Cahn said.",
      "And in Episode 2, Tim's business partner Kenny (voiced by Ke Huy Quan) tells him that the feds have raided his office. Kenny then warns Tim that they have everything on their business dealings in Brunei, which Tim implies could be tied to money laundering.",
      "The image for Blackpink singer Lalisa Manobal, who plays Mook, seems to show a woman holding an umbrella and flirting with a man, Cahn said.",
      "\"In the first episode, she is trying to convince her partner to go after more lucrative bodyguard positions that would enable them to travel,\" Cahn noted of Mook.",
      "Michelle Monaghan, who plays the third woman vacationing in Thailand with her two best friends, has a topless woman on a balcony in the image alongside her name.",
      "Sam Nivola, who plays one of Tim\u2019s sons Lochlan, shared on TODAY that the illustration beside his name is just a boy lying down \u2014 but he did give the show\u2019s creator Mike White some room for interpretation with the opening credits.",
      "\u201cWhat if he\u2019s just like, screwing with us all?\u201d Nivola asked.",
      "Cahn analyzed the painting as a boy in his underwear floating in the water, perhaps showing a direct line to who could end up dead in the water at the end of the series.",
      "But as Nivola himself said on TODAY, it all could be a red herring as well.",
      "Lek Patravadi, who plays the owner of the hotel, is shown with a woman seated in a lotus position holding a bird with a human head in her hand, Cahn said.",
      "Parker Posey's image shows two monkeys sitting together, one of which is blowing smoke, which Cahn said could allude to the Southern mom's dependence on prescription drugs.",
      "After Posey's name, the credits cut to an alligator looking in the distance, and then pans over to a heron or crane looking at its reflection in the water.",
      "Natasha Rothwell's name pops up, which Cahn said could relate to the myth of Narcissus, or even her ability to see Gary as Greg.",
      "\"Or perhaps it deals with the self-reflection she will be undertaking during her 3 months in Thailand,\" Cahn said.",
      "Two men appear to be peeping watching a topless woman (a possible reference to the image from Monaghan's name, Cahn noted) from afar in some trees in the next section \u2014 as Patrick Schwarzenegger's name comes up.",
      "\"Patrick Schwarzenegger is clearly, like, the guy that would be leering through the bushes,\" Cahn said, referring to his character Saxon. \"I feel like he instantly tries to hit on (women), and they're like, 'What?' ... it feels like this kind of peeping Tom energy.\"",
      "Tayme Thapthimthong, who plays the hotel's bodyguard Gaitok, has a man fighting a tiger alongside his name, while a cow or ram watches from above, Cahn said.",
      "A large cat has attacked another animal alongside Aimee Lou Wood's name, while two other animals look on and watch. Cahn questioned if Wood's character Chelsea is the attacked animal \u2014 or if she could be the feline itself.",
      "Wood\u2019s name is the last cast member\u2019s name to be shown before members of the crew. A large group of monkeys are seen traveling together, with one monkey pointing the way, as the casting director Meredith Tucker\u2019s name is shown.",
      "Two monkeys appear to be crawling up a tower as the Thailand casting director Non Jungmeier's name is shown, and four people are at the top of the tower as costume designer Alex Boivard's name comes into the frame. One person is holding a snake towards the monkeys, Cahn noted.",
      "The next few scenes show what could be an attack on a place, before a boat appears to capsize, and some of the crew are eaten by large fish, Cahn said.",
      "The last image is of a man paddling on a log while another fish looks on, as White's name is credited as creating the series.",
      "The credits end with an ornate red temple with a Buddha in the middle, which Cahn said could be an allusion to the hotel owner's husband.",
      "Whether Lochlan ends up floating the water, or if the tree of knives falls on Timothy, still remains to be seen. But the theories as to who dies at the end of Season 3 of \"The White Lotus\" are just getting started.",
      "And if \"The White Lotus\" has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we should analyze everything \u2014 from the\u00a0Testa di Moro statues to the art on the walls."

      "Brown explains that each \u201cParadise\u201d season might explore \u201cthe same community, but from a slightly different aspect.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, we\u2019re looking at what happens to the world inside of Paradise? The people who prepared for it, who knew that it was coming, how do they manage the situation? How do people manage the situation that had no idea what was coming and are forced to live without any sort of infrastructure?\u201d Brown says.",
      "He says that one of the questions that remains heading into future seasons is: What is life like?",
      "\u201cThat is something that, if and when we get picked up for Season 2, we will be exploring,\u201d he says. \u201cI can tell you that much, but I think the main exploration and the main question will be, is his wife really alive? That will be a propelling, sort of, drive to Season 2.\u201d",

      "Palmer attended the star-studded ceremony Feb. 23 dressed to the nines in a vintage Chanel gown. The dress originally appeared on the runway in 1985, according to the actor\u2019s stylist Molly Dickson, who shared more pictures and details of the outfit on her Instagram story.",
      "The \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d star posed on the red carpet in the svelte velvet black gown that featured a stunning gold neckline and elegant black gloves. She styled the look with an auburn bob and bright red lip. Later in the evening, she continued to show off the gown when she presented an award alongside Colman Domingo.",
      "Also in attendance at the 2025 SAG Awards was Jamie Lee Curtis, who previously wore the same classic Chanel dress on Feb. 28, 1986 at the First Annual American Cinematheque Award Salute to Eddie Murphy. But Sunday night, Curtis opted for a sequined and feathered black gown. The Oscar-winner took the stage to present an award, as well.",
      "Hours after the ceremony ended, Curtis posted a screenshot from People magazine on Instagram that showed her and Palmer both sporting the gown, nearly 40 years apart.",
      "\u201cAs much as I would love to say it was mine, it was borrowed from my friend @debopp and I\u2019m thrilled to be anywhere near @keke in style and grace and talent!,\u201d \u00a0Curtis sweetly shared in the caption.",
      "Palmer replied to Curtis\u2019 post and cheered in the comments, \u201cMy QUEEN! I love you!!!!\u201d",
      "The next day, Palmer returned to Instagram to share pictures from the Hollywood event and revealed in the caption that she was unaware Curtis rocked the look before her.",
      "\u201cAll I can say is, what a weekend! I picked this dress last night because I thought it was beautiful, never realized one of my mentors @jamieleecurtis had worn it before!\u201d Palmer said.",
      "She went on to gush about Curtis, whom she starred with in the short-lived Fox series \u201cScream Queens.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur time on Scream Queens taught me so much, I need you guys to know that she took me under her wing and SAW me during that show,\u201d Palmer wrote. \u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll do a one woman show and give y\u2019all the tea, ha!\u201d",
      "Palmer also revealed that the two have kept in touch since then.",
      "\u201cWhen Leo was born she sent him a load of books, ones which he holds dear to this day,\u201d Palmer continued of Curtis, also referring to her nearly 2-year-old son.",
      "At the end of the post, Palmer further praised Curtis, adding, \u201cShe is a one of a kind in this industry and I can\u2019t wait until we are reunited on the big or small screen. She\u2019s what we call, a real one!\u201d",
      "Curtis and Palmer worked together on Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u201cScream Queens\u201d from 2015 to 2016 and the \u201cHalloween\u201d star was nothing but complimentary about their time as co-stars.",
      "In August 2016, Curtis uploaded a snap of Palmer to Instagram\u00a0celebrating her birthday on set.",
      "\u201cSaying a prayer of thanks for her beautiful life and family, friends and snapchat and then @kekepalmer blew the set DOWN!\u201d she said. \u201cThe GAG is EVERYBODY LOVES YOU! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SWEET KEKE! I love you.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Former \u201cBoy Meets World\u201d costars Danielle Fishel and Maitland Ward delivered a lesson in awkward tension when things came to a head during the latest episode of the \u201cPod Meets World\u201d podcast.",
      "For the podcast\u2019s Feb. 24 episode, Fishel, Rider Strong and Will Friedle brought Ward on as the show\u2019s latest guest. Ward joined the cast of \u201cBoy Meets World\u201d as Rachel McGuire in 1998 during the show\u2019s sixth season as a student who becomes a roommate to Eric Matthews (Friedle) and Jack Hunter (Matthew Lawrence). At the top of the episode, the former cast members spoke about how she has since become an adult film star and a model for OnlyFans.",
      "However, it was Fishel\u2019s direct question to Ward, part way into the episode, that set the tone for the rest of the conversation: \u201cDo you hate us?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate you,\u201d Ward replied, not mincing words. \u201cThere\u2019s some beef between us. And maybe I picked up the wrong signals, but definitely, there was some sort of weirdness there.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so what did you think it was?\u201d Fishel confronted.",
      "The conversation escalated when Ward suggested that Fishel harbored jealous feelings towards her when they reunited years later for \u201cGirl Meets World,\u201d the Disney Channel sequel to \u201cBoy Meets World.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the fact that I was getting a lot of attention at that time and going off in my own space and taking away, like that attention,\u201d Ward replied, a claim Fishel swiftly shut down.",
      "\u201cI was on the cover of Maxim in 2014,\u201d she countered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in any way upset.\u201d",
      "While talking over one another, the two actors hashed out lingering grievances, including Ward\u2019s claim that Fishel had unfriended her on Facebook and Fishel\u2019s accusation that Ward was seeking attention on the podcast. The more they dug in, the more the unease grew, with Fishel accusing Ward of speaking regularly and critically to TMZ about the podcast.",
      "\u201cIt seems like almost any time the podcast is in the news, in the press, there\u2019s a quickly followed-up TMZ interview with you,\u201d Fishel replied. \u201cHow do those happen, by the way?\u201d",
      "\u201cThey come and get me; they find me on the streets,\u201d Ward replied. \u201cAre you trying to accuse me of something?\u201d",
      "\u201cI was just curious because it seems as though every time we\u2019ve been in the news, shortly thereafter, there\u2019s an interview with you on TMZ,\u201d Fishel replied.",
      "When Fishel continued asking about her TMZ interviews, Ward replied, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why this is like a grilling session right now?\u201d",
      "More friction arose when Ward addressed the group, saying, \u201cI think there\u2019s a divide too because you guys hate Ben (Savage), and you guys hate (\u2018Boy Meets World\u2019 creator) Michael (Jacobs).\u201d",
      "\u201cBen is one of the most important people I\u2019ve ever met in my life, and I can\u2019t stand the fact that he won\u2019t speak to us,\u201d Friedle cut in, later adding, \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it is: He won\u2019t speak to us.\u201d",
      "When Ward accused Fishel of inviting her on the show for rating, Fishel, in turn, replied, \u201cI\u2019m not the one who wanted to go after ratings.\u201d",
      "At one point, Ward's connection was lost and exited the interview. A producer asked Friedle to text her and make sure it wasn't intentional and shortly after, Ward logged back on.",
      "By the end, the podcasters and Ward wrapped up with a friendly to tepid farewell, with the hosts suggesting that Ward join them again.",
      "\u201cThank you for joining us, Maitland,\u201d Fishel said. \u201cIt was nice to talk to you. Share some good times, share not-so-good times.\u201d",
      "Ward signed off, replying, \u201cThanks.\u201d",
      "Still, when Ward was gone, and only the three hosts remained for a\u00a0recap, Friedle replied, \u201cI don\u2019t like when things are tense.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know,\u201d Fishel replied, before saying again that Ward was using the conflict as an opportunity for publicity.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hate Maitland, not even the slightest,\u201d she concluded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have her back (on the podcast). Does that mean that Maitland and I need to have each other\u2019s numbers and send each other texts? Absolutely not. We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t need that, and that\u2019s OK.\u201d"

I retired for 15 years, and then I came back at 65, which is not usual. And I made one of my most successful movies in my 80s. And probably in my 90s, I'll be doing my own stunts and an action movie.",

      "I love acting. We get to open people's minds to new ideas, take them beyond what they understand of the world and help them laugh when things are tough. Like now. And for a woman like me who grew up in the '40s and '50s when women weren't supposed to have opinions and not get angry, acting gave me a chance to play angry women with opinions. Which as you know, is a bit of a stretch for me.",
      "I'm a big believer in unions. They have our backs. They bring us into community, and they give us power. Community means power. And this is really important right now, when workers' power ... workers' power is being attacked, and community is being weakened. Yes. But SAG-AFTRA is different than most other unions because us, the workers, we actors, we don't manufacture anything tangible.",

      "We have to drill deep, don't we? We have to know, for example, if a young woman is cutting, or she's a sex worker, there's a good chance that as a young girl she was sexually abused or incested. I'm thinking Bree Daniels in \"Klute.\" And I'm sure many of you guys have played bullies and misogynists, and you can pretty much know, you actors, right, that probably their father bullied them and called men that he felt were weak, he called them losers or pussies.",

A whole lot of people are going to be really hurt by what is happening, what is coming our way. And even if they're of a different political persuasion, we need to call upon our empathy and not judge, but listen from our hearts and welcome them into our tent, because we are going to need a big tent to resist successfully what's coming at us.",
      "I made my first movie in 1958. It was the tail end of McCarthyism, when so many careers were destroyed. Today it's helpful to remember, though, that Hollywood resisted. We did. Overseas, brave American producers like Hannah Weinstein hired blacklisted writers. Myrna Loy, John Huston and Billy Wilder founded the Committee for the First Amendment.",

      "This is it. And we mustn't for a moment kid ourselves about what's happening. This is big-time serious, folks. So let's be brave. This is a good time for a little Norma Rae or Karen Silkwood or Tom Joad. We must not isolate. We must stay in community. We must help the vulnerable. We must find ways to project an inspiring vision of the future.

    "title": "Russia offered U.S. a deal for minerals in Ukrainian territory it seized",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 23:51:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Russian officials proposed to Trump administration officials an agreement for the U.S. to make money off critical minerals and metals under Moscow\u2019s control.",
    "story": [
      "Russia has proposed to the Trump administration a potential agreement under which the United States would gain some ownership of rare earth minerals and other valuable metals in parts of Ukraine controlled by the Russian military, according to two U.S. officials familiar with intelligence on the matter and another person briefed on the proposal.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously presented Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with a similar deal, which Zelenskyy initially rejected, frustrating President Donald Trump.",
      "Top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin floated Russia\u2019s idea with Trump administration officials last week at a meeting in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. officials and the person briefed on the proposal said.",
      "The options Russia had specifically prepared to discuss with U.S. officials included scenarios that could give the Trump administration access to minerals in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, both of which Russia declared it had annexed in 2022, the two U.S. officials said.",
      "The Trump administration has not committed to a U.S.-Russia deal on rare earth minerals but has not ruled it out, the U.S. officials and the person briefed on the proposal said.",
      "\u201cTrump is transactional, so Putin \u2014 understanding that \u2014 has come up with this countermove,\u201d a former U.S. diplomat with experience in the region said,\u00a0adding that the Russians could clearly see both Trump\u2019s interest in Ukraine\u2019s natural resources and Zelenskyy\u2019s hesitation.",
      "Trump suggested an openness Monday to an agreement with Russia.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do some economic development deals. They have a lot of things that we want,\u201d Trump told reporters, referring to Russia. \u201cYou know, they have massive rare earth. It\u2019s ... very large. ...",
      "\u201cIf we could do that, I think it would be a very good thing for world peace and lasting peace,\u201d Trump added. \u201cJust as we\u2019re doing with Ukraine, if we could do some economic development in terms of Russia and getting things that we want, something like that would be possible.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday Trump said an agreement with Russia for minerals on Ukrainian land it now controls \u201ccould take place,\u201d but did not say if he\u2019s spoken with Putin about the possibility.",
      "Putin said in an interview with Russian state television Monday that he is open to offering the United States access to rare minerals in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine, as well as in Russia.",
      "Responding to U.S. negotiations with Ukraine over a possible agreement to share revenues from the country\u2019s mineral resources, Putin said that such a deal would not be cause for concern and that Russia had \u201csignificantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine.\u201d He also said his government and the United States could collaborate on aluminum extraction and supply.",
      "Asked about Russia\u2019s proposing a deal with the United States on rare earth minerals and other metals, including those in Ukrainian territory that Moscow has seized by invading Ukraine, a spokesperson for the National Security Council pointed to Trump\u2019s remarks Monday.",
      "Russia\u2019s embassy in Washington did not\u00a0respond to a request for comment.",
      "Zelenskyy had first suggested a possible agreement with \u201cstrategic partners\u201d to jointly develop and secure the country\u2019s natural resources as part of a proposed\u00a0peace plan\u00a0last year.",
      "The meeting in Saudi Arabia was attended by Secretary of State Marco Rubio; national security adviser Mike Waltz; the Trump administration\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff; Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov; and close Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov.",
      "Russia proposed a new economic partnership to the U.S. officials that would involve territory that Moscow seized in its 2022 invasion of Ukraine and that would coincide with the end of the war, the U.S. officials and the person briefed on the proposal said.",
      "It would effectively ensure that Russia would retain swaths of Ukrainian territory that it occupies and hopes to keep as part of a negotiated peace deal. It also is designed to appeal to Trump\u2019s pursuit of a financial cut for the United States in a negotiated end to the war. Trump has pushed for Ukraine to agree to give the United States $500 billion worth of its rare earth minerals, proposing that the two countries split ownership of the minerals evenly, NBC News has reported.",
      "Trump said this week that his administration is close to signing a deal with Ukraine over its rare earth minerals. He has also said he expects to meet with Zelenskyy soon.",
      "U.S. joint ownership of Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth could change how Trump views America\u2019s interests in Ukraine and undermine Moscow\u2019s goal of dominating the country, and that may be a motivating factor for Russia, the former diplomat with experience in the region said.",
      "Many of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals are in areas controlled or threatened by the Russian military, and Russian oligarchs are already exploiting some of them, according to five U.S. officials.",
      "Accessing rare earth minerals on any Ukrainian territory could be complicated and costly.",
      "James Cowan, the CEO of HALO Trust, a humanitarian de-mining organization working in Ukraine, warned this month at a security conference that as much as 156,000 square kilometers of Ukraine is contaminated with land mines or other explosives.",
      "\u201cAny proposals to tap Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth will need to incorporate a plan for the clearance of the land mines if it is to be remotely viable,\u201d Cowan, a retired British major general,\u00a0said at the time."

    "summary": "Despite his condition, Pope Francis has upheld a tradition he began at the start of the war in Gaza, making nightly calls to the strip's only Catholic parish.",
    "story": [
      "He's in critical condition and battling double pneumonia, but Pope Francis has upheld a tradition he began nearly a year and a half ago at the start of the war in Gaza, making nightly calls to the only Catholic parish in the enclave to offer words of support and prayer.",
      "And now, as the ailing pontiff receives care at Rome's Gemelli hospital, Catholic Palestinians in Gaza are offering Francis their own prayers, with leaders and members of the Holy Family parish in northern Gaza praying for his recovery.",
      "\"Let\u2019s unite in praying for the healing of Pope Francis,\" Yusuf Asad, a priest of the Holy Family parish, wrote in a post on Facebook early Tuesday as he offered a prayer for the 88-year-old pope's recovery, as he has done each day since Francis was admitted to the hospital Feb. 14.",
      "News of Francis' condition has sent shock waves through this small community in the Gaza Strip, with the Holy Family parish's prayers for him highlighting the deep bond formed between the pontiff and the Palestinian church throughout the devastating war.",
      "Since two days after Israel began bombing the Gaza Strip following the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, Francis has made nightly calls to Gabriele Romanelli, parish priest at Holy Family, as well as to Asad, Romanelli's assistant, according to Vatican News.",
      "When Francis was diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs, it was unclear whether he would be able to continue the tradition as he received care.",
      "On Monday morning, however, the Vatican said that even as the pontiff remained in critical condition, he had shown a \"slight improvement\" and was able to resume work from his hospital bed, including calling the pastor of the Gaza parish \"to express his fatherly closeness.\"",
      "The Holy See said Tuesday that Francis' condition remained the same.",
      "While his calls with the Holy Family parish last just a few minutes, according to Vatican News, they have been a way for him to stay connected with Gaza's Christian community, with hundreds of people, including Christians and Muslims, taking shelter in the parish throughout Israel's offensive in the territory.",
      "At the end of a general audience on Jan. 22, Francis described the cautious optimism that leaders of the parish expressed after the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re happy. They ate lentils,\" Francis said at the time, according to Vatican News, adding: \"We must pray for peace.\"",
      "In a video published by Vatican News last month, Francis could be seen on a video call with Asad, saying \u201cGood evening, how are you?\u201d in Italian and asking him what he ate that day, with Asad laughing before telling the pontiff the whole community had been able to eat chicken.",
      "\u201cThey want to thank you, Holy Father. They pray for you because you always pray for them,\u201d Yusuf told the pope, according to Vatican News.",
      "Francis has been outspoken in condemning the violence unfolding in Gaza over the past 16 months, with more than 48,000 people, including thousands of children, killed since Israel launched its offensive in the territory, according to local health authorities.",
      "Last month, Francis stepped up criticisms of Israel's military campaign, calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza \"very serious and shameful\" in a yearly address to diplomats delivered on his behalf by an aide.",
      "The pontiff was also outspoken in his criticism of an incident that unfolded at the Holy Family parish in December 2023, when a mother and her adult daughter were shot dead while walking inside the grounds of the parish, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem.",
      "Israel at the time denied responsibility for the incident, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office saying that according to an Israel Defense Forces investigation, claims that Israel was responsible for their deaths were \"not true.\"",
      "Fears have grown in recent days for the future of the current ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, with the two sides yet to negotiate the second phase of the truce.",
      "Israel said this week that it will delay the release of hundreds of Palestinian\u00a0prisoners, Netanyahu's office saying it would do so \u201cuntil the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies\u201d that have marked previous releases.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel has continued to ramp up operations in the occupied West Bank, with IDF tanks seen moving into the territory for the first time in decades this past week.",
      "Israeli bulldozers have demolished large swaths of the Jenin refugee camp and appeared to be clearing wide roads through its previously narrow alleyways, Reuters reported, with thousands of Palestinians leaving their homes in Jenin and nearby Tulkarm."

    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of people gathered at a stadium in Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut to mourn Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a public funeral nearly five months after he was killed by an Israeli airstrike.",
      "Determined to project strength despite the devastating losses it has faced since Nasrallah\u2019s death \u2014 including leadership uncertainty and mounting Israeli military pressure \u2014 a weakened Hezbollah staged the funeral as a display of unity and resilience.",
      "Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 when Israeli forces bombed a building in southern Beirut where he was meeting with Hezbollah commanders. It was a stunning assassination that shocked supporters in Lebanon and across the region, as Israel celebrated killing a man who had orchestrated attacks on the country and posed a threat to its security.",
      "Hezbollah began exchanging fire with Israel in support of Palestinians on Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Israel declared war on Hamas following the Oct. 7 attacks. The 14-month conflict lead to an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon and prolonged bombing of Beirut that targeted Hezbollah leadership and led to Nasrallah\u2019s death.",
      "The 48,000-seat Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in Hezbollah\u2019s stronghold of southern Beirut was awash with the yellow and green of Hezbollah flags as mourners paid tribute to the divisive leader who led the militant group for more than three decades.",
      "A line of hundreds of cars was seen driving toward the stadium at dawn, and supporters held parallel tributes, including in the Iranian capital of Tehran, Yemen and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "According to Reuters, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was was expected to attend, alongside an Iraqi delegation including Shi\u2019ite politicians and militia commanders. A delegation from Yemen\u2019s Houthis was also expected to attend.",
      "After Sunday\u2019s funeral, his body will be buried at a site nearby.",
      "The funeral will also honor Hashem Safieddine, who led Hezbollah for just a week after Nasrallah\u2019s death before he was also killed by Israel. He is to be buried in the south of the country on Monday.",
      "After Nasrallah\u2019s death, his body was buried temporarily next to his son, Hadi, who died fighting for Hezbollah in 1997. Nasrallah\u2019s official funeral was delayed until Israeli forces had withdrawn from south Lebanon under the terms of a ceasefire deal that ended the war.",
      "As his funeral took place, the Israel Defense Forces launched airstrikes in southern Lebanon on \u201ca military site containing rocket launchers and weapons\u201d where it said it had identified Hezbollah activity.",
      "According to the Lebanese National News Agency, the strikes injured at least one girl, who was transported to the Lebanese Italian Hospital for treatment.",
      "The attack during his funeral highlighted Israel\u2019s ongoing military pressure on the group that defined the final year of Nasrallah\u2019s life. Revered by Hezbollah supporters, the Islamic scholar transformed the group from a militant resistance faction to an influential political and military force in the region.",
      "While thousands paid tribute to the former leader, he left behind a legacy marked by deep admiration and intense controversy.",
      "Born into a poor Shiite family in Beirut in 1960,\u00a0Nasrallah\u2019s rise to prominence was shaped by Lebanon\u2019s turbulent history and his deep ideological commitments.",
      "In 1982, following Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, Nasrallah helped found Hezbollah, a group focused on resisting Israeli occupation and known for its precision attacks.",
      "Designated a terrorist organization by many countries, including the United States, Canada and the European Union, Hezbollah attacks included the 1983 Beirut embassy bombing that killed 63 people, including 17 Americans, and the Marine barracks bombing that same year in the capital, which killed 307 people, including 241 American military personnel.",
      "Nasrallah became its leader in 1992, marking a transformative era for Hezbollah in which it expanded its military capabilities and political influence in Lebanon. Under his guidance, Hezbollah fought the 2006 war with Israel, as rockets rained down on northern Israel while Israeli airstrikes ravaged southern Lebanon for 34 days.",
      "His influence soared during the conflict, where he was widely regarded as a symbol of defiance across the Arab world. Hezbollah\u2019s extensive media apparatus amplified his charisma, making him an influential figure beyond Lebanon\u2019s borders.",
      "He also forged deep alliances with Iran and Syria, with Iran providing critical financial, military and political support that helped Hezbollah become a major regional force.",
      "However, his decision to send fighters to Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad in the country\u2019s civil war marked a turning point. Once seen as the leader of resistance, he became increasingly viewed as an agent of Iran\u2019s regional ambitions.",

      "PARIS \u2014 Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque remembers the moment when she finally understood the unexplained bouts of depression and other disorders that had tormented her for more than two decades.",
      "Now 42, she connected the dots in 2019 when she saw a report about a surgeon under investigation on suspicion of sexually assaulting patients over three decades and meticulously cataloging the abuse in digital diaries.",
      "L\u00e9v\u00eaque was 9 years old when her appendix was removed by the surgeon.",
      "\u201cImmediately I knew, voil\u00e0, that\u2019s what happened to me,\u201d L\u00e9v\u00eaque told AFP. \u201cThis explained so many strange things in my life, like my phobia of hospitals, my eating disorders \u2026 a life suspended since my operation.\u201d",
      "L\u00e9v\u00eaque is set to testify at France\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse trial, which opens Monday in Vannes, a picturesque town in coastal Brittany. Former surgeon Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, 74, is charged with raping or sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades, most of them girls and boys under 15 whose average age was 11.",
      "Many victims have said they don\u2019t remember being assaulted and experienced similar symptoms to L\u00e9v\u00eaque\u2019s, their lawyers said. Others suffered sexual dysfunction and fell into substance abuse. When police, taking names from Le Scouarnec\u2019s writings, sought them out and showed them the passages written about them, those revelations triggered physical and psychological reactions of varying degrees, the lawyers added. Two men, both 25, died by suicide in 2020 and 2021.",
      "The case, which includes a dark history of incest, has raised questions about how a well-respected surgeon who worked in nine hospitals and clinics across five regions in northwest France was allowed to practice when there were so many red flags that legal observers say should have signaled that Le Scouarnec was dangerous, including a 2005 conviction for possessing material depicting child sexual abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyers declined to comment, but prosecutors said he has admitted to many, but not all, of the charges. Unlike in the United States, defendants in France are brought to trial even if they admit guilt.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates hope the trial, set to last four months, will prompt a hard look at what they call a lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d said Francesca Satta, who is representing 10 victims and families. \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "\u2018Pedophile fantasies\u2019",
      "Beyond the medical world, the lines have often blurred in France over what constitutes child abuse versus seduction.\u00a0The once-celebrated writer Gabriel Matzneff, now 88, made having sex with adolescents a staple of his books, even boasting about the practice in an infamous TV interview, until a leading literary publisher, Vanessa Springora, called him out in her own 2020 book for grooming her for sex in the 1980s when she was 14 and he was 50.",
      "It is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged. Earlier this month, in a closely watched case seen as a test of evolving attitudes toward sex with minors, the director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually assaulting actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel, now 35, from the time he cast her in a film when she was 12 and he was 36. He was sentenced to two years of house arrest, with two years suspended.",
      "\u201cL\u2019Affaire Scouarnec\u201d has drawn parallels with another high-profile trial that transfixed the country late last year and led to the conviction of Dominique Pelicot, 72, for organizing and documenting the mass rape of his sleeping wife, whom he drugged, by dozens of men over a decade. He is now under investigation for two other alleged crimes involving drugging: the rape and murder of a young woman in 1991 and the attempted rape of another in 1999.",
      "As in the Pelicot case, investigators discovered a trove of allegedly incriminating evidence on hard drives seized in the suspect\u2019s house, including thousands of photos depicting child sexual abuse and videos, many of them violent, French media reported.",
      "Le Scouarnec allegedly told investigators he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began keeping a diary, according to court documents. Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the\u00a0documents show.",
      "The assaults tracked in the digital diaries stop in March 2017, when Le Scouarnec was arrested on charges of raping his 6-year-old neighbor after luring her across a gap in the mesh fence between their gardens, according to testimony. In December 2020, he was convicted in that case, along with the rape and sexual assault of two of his nieces when they were children in the 1980s and \u201990s, and a 4-year-old patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the 15 years he is now serving in connection with the 2020 conviction. With his pretrial detention and parole eligibility taken into account, he could be out by 2030, said lawyer Marie Grimaud.",
      "Grimaud, who is representing 37 victims, and other lawyers say the penalties for sex crimes and child abuse should be much more severe.",
      "\u201cIn France, if you rape one person, you rape 300, it\u2019s exactly the same number of years you\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.",
      "Warning signs",
      "The first people who knew about Le Scouarnec\u2019s behavior were his family. As early as 1984, references to the rapes of a niece and a family friend appear in the surgeon\u2019s diaries, according to court documents. But none of the adults took action, even after the children told them, and the abuse continued, three family members told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is a man who sees children as sexual objects,\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece Alexandra, 47, told NBC News. She said her uncle isolated her and then raped her from ages 5 to 13. (NBC News does not name victims\u00a0of sexual assault, but Alexandra has asked that her first name be used.)",
      "She said she will testify at the upcoming trial, along with a family friend who was also one of the first victims mentioned in the diaries, though Le Scouarnec cannot be charged in their cases because the acts happened too long ago under French law.",
      "Some children knew Le Scouarnec\u2019s \u201cexam\u201d was not appropriate, but their parents brushed aside their complaints, said Hugo Lemonier, a journalist who spent three years researching a new book about the case, \u201cTrapped: In the Intimate Diaries of Dr. Le Scouarnec.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we see in this case is the omnipotence of the medical profession,\u201d he said.",
      "French authorities were first alerted in January 2004, when the FBI told them Le Scouarnec\u2019s credit card was linked to a pedophile website the agency was monitoring, court records show. There is no indication that medical authorities were notified as the police carried out their investigation.",
      "At his trial for possession of child sexual abuse material in the fall of 2005, the surgeon was \u201calmost considered a victim,\u201d Lemonier said. Le Scouarnec presented himself as a man \u201cin a moment of great distress,\u201d recounting how his wife had left him, taking their three kids, and in his solitude he \u201cfound a refuge, an escape\u201d in viewing the material, he added.",
      "The surgeon, who specialized in appendectomies and abdominal and gynecological surgery, got a break when the judge imposed a four-month suspended sentence with no restrictions.",
      "\u201cThe judge could have ordered him to stop practicing or seek treatment, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Homayra Sellier, founder of the child protection agency Innocence in Danger. \u201cHe should have lost his medical license.\u201d",
      "Another opportunity was missed in June 2006, when a psychiatrist at the hospital where Le Scouarnec worked in Quimperl\u00e9, on the southern coast of Brittany, learned about his conviction and wrote a letter alerting the hospital director, who passed it along to the local medical board and ordered the surgeon to be accompanied whenever he was with minors, according to France Info.",
      "\u2018A nutcase in Brittany\u2019",
      "The local medical board requested a copy of the conviction, but it took the prosecutor\u2019s office five months to send it, which was then forwarded to state authorities, Lemonier said. \u201cAfter that, they washed their hands of it.\u201d",
      "Back at the hospital, the order requiring the surgeon to be shadowed was never carried out, and Le Scouarnec, whose modus operandi was to isolate victims under the guise of examining them, would go on to abuse at least 54 more victims from 2004 to 2017, all of whom are part of the current case, Lemonier said.",
      "Not all of the victims in the diaries have been pursued by investigators, he said, adding that according to his count the total could top 400.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a chain of failures where nobody wanted to take responsibility,\u201d Lemonier said. \u201cThe police, the courts, the medical association, the hospitals, the health authorities and the state are all responsible.\u201d",
      "The hospital director, Andr\u00e9 Labat, died in 2013. The current administration declined to comment when contacted by NBC News, as did all of the boards that could have imposed sanctions or revoked Le Scouarnec\u2019s medical license, including the local and regional medical boards and the regional health agency. The national Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The local branch of the national police referred questions to the national police press office, which also did not respond.",
      "\u201cThe French authorities were warned that we had a nutcase in Brittany,\u201d said lawyer Maud Touitou, who represents eight victims. She called local oversight boards \u201cbarons\u201d that \u201crevel in their provincial social status, who have no other goal but to continue to have and exercise their little power.\u201d",
      "In June 2008, Le Scouarnec moved to a hospital in Jonzac, about five hours\u2019 drive south, where he was considered the \u201cwise man\u201d on staff, Le Monde reported. The hospital\u2019s former director, Mich\u00e8le Cals, told police in 2017 that she didn\u2019t take \u201cany special measures\u201d when the surgeon told her about his conviction because there had been \u201cno physical aggression,\u201d according to Radio France, which counted more than 20 victims at the Jonzac hospital. Cals could not be reached for comment, and the Jonzac hospital declined to comment.",
      "\u200b\u200bChildren\u2019s advocates are hoping the trial will prompt sweeping changes beyond tougher laws. They are hoping that the accounts of victims will be given greater credence.",
      "For the victims, who have waited nearly eight years since the investigation began to tell their stories \u2014 some have waited decades \u2014 the trial represents a chance to heal.",
      "\u201cThe only fear they have is that the entire trial will focus on Le Scouarnec,\u201d Grimaud said.",
      "\u201cThey want to be recognized.\u201d",
      "Linda Hervieux reported from Paris, and Gabrielle Nolin from London.",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org.

      "Belize Commissioner of Police Chester Williams said at a news conference captured on video by Channel 5 Belize that three U.S. nationals, all women, were found in a hotel room on Saturday after housekeeping staff alerted management because there was no response from potential occupants after a second consecutive day of door knocks.",
      "He did not identify the three on camera but said they were U.S. nationals born in Morocco. Family of the deceased declined to speak.",
      "\"It\u2019s a tragic incident certainly for us and the families of those young women,\" Williams said.",

      "In a statement, a U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed the deaths of three American citizens. \u201cWe are in touch with and collaborating closely with the local authorities\u2019 investigation into the deaths,\" the official said.",
      "At the news conference, Williams said each body was next to vomit and that alcohol and \"gummies\" were in the hotel room.

HTS was formerly affiliated with Al Qaeda, although it broke ties and al-Sharaa has since preached coexistence.",
      "The organizers of the Damascus conference said all of Syria\u2019s communities were invited \u2014 but it was not immediately clear how many minority participants showed up. The gathering is meant to come up with non-binding recommendations to the country\u2019s interim rules ahead of the drafting of a new constitution and formation of a new government.",

      "Interim Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said Syria\u2019s new authorities \u201cwill not accept any violation of our sovereignty or the independence of our national decisions.\u201d He also touted the new government\u2019s efforts to rebuild diplomatic ties with Arab and Western countries and push for lifting of sanctions imposed during Assad\u2019s rule."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A fleet of Chinese fishing vessels used North Korean crews from 2019 to 2024 in violation of U.N. bans, and many people were apparently subjected to abuses including being trapped at sea for years, a report said Monday.",
      "The Environmental Justice Foundation, a London-based group specializing in environmental and human rights issues, said it identified the presence of North Koreans on 12 Chinese tuna long-liners operating in the southwest Indian Ocean. The report was based mostly on interviews with 19 Indonesians and Filipinos who worked alongside them.",
      "\u201cThe testimony received from Indonesian and Filipino crew members suggests that concerted efforts were made to hide the presence of North Koreans on these vessels, and that those North Koreans on board were forced to work for as many as 10 years at sea \u2014 in some instances without ever stepping foot on land,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThis would constitute forced labor of a magnitude that surpasses much of that witnessed in a global fishing industry already replete with abuse,\u201d it added.",
      "The group said the North Koreans were passed from vessel to vessel to prevent them from returning to land. It cited unidentified Asian crew members as saying their North Korean shipmates were not allowed to use mobile phones or leave vessels during port visits.",
      "The group said it was unable to estimate the number of North Koreans aboard the Chinese vessels because of the transfers.",
      "The use of North Korean crew would be a breach of 2017 U.N. Security Council resolutions that required member states not to issue work permits to North Koreans and to repatriate all remaining North Korean workers from their territories by the end of 2019.",
      "The sanctions were adopted after North Korea conducted nuclear and long-range missile tests in violation of earlier council resolutions.",
      "The group said the use of North Korean crews also appears to have bypassed legal frameworks in Britain and the European Union designed to prevent goods produced by North Koreans from entering their supply chains. The EJF said that it also found ships that were suspected of collecting fish from the Chinese vessels had entered key markets in Asia including Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.",
      "Along with Russia, China is suspected of not fully enforcing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and has vetoed U.S.-led efforts to toughen U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its banned weapons tests.",
      "Asked about the EJF report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a briefing Monday that he was not not familiar with it but said China carries out offshore fishing in accordance with laws and regulations.",
      "Lin said China\u2019s relevant cooperation with North Korea is also conducted \u201cwithin the framework of international law.\u201d",
      "The EJF said it was the first time North Korean labor had been publicly documented on a distant-water fishing vessel.",

      "North Korean workers abroad were in general under the constant surveillance of their country\u2019s security agents, toiled more than 12 hours a day and took home a fraction of their salaries, with the rest going to their government, according to defectors and experts.",
      "Despite the U.N. ban, South Korean officials and experts believe a large number of North Korean workers remain engaged in economic activities around the world and transmit money that is used in the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programs."
