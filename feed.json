      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d has topped the holiday box office charts in the U.S. and abroad",
      "Dinosaur fatigue may be a theme in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d but moviegoing audiences don\u2019t seem to have that reservation. The newest installment in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d franchise ruled the Fourth of July holiday box office with a global, five-day launch of $318.3 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "The Universal Pictures release, directed by Gareth Edwards, opened on Wednesday and earned $147.3 million in its first five days in 4,308 North American theaters. An estimated $91.5 million of that comes from the traditional \u201cthree day\u201d weekend, which includes the Friday holiday, Saturday and projected Sunday ticket sales.",
      "Internationally, it opened in 82 markets including China, adding $171 million to the opening total. According to the studio, $41.5 million of that came from China alone, where it played on 65,000 screens, 760 of which were IMAX. It's the country's biggest MPA (Motion Picture Association) opening of the year.",
      "\u201cRebirth,\u201d starring Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey, is the fourth movie in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d series and the seventh since Steven Spielberg\u2019s original Michael Crichton adaptation stormed theaters in the summer of 1993. The new film received mixed reviews from critics, carrying a 51% on Rotten Tomatoes, and B CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences.",
      "Factors like the holiday weekend, inflation and post-COVID moviegoing realities make it difficult to fairly compare the \u201cRebirth\u201d launch to the other films in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d franchise, the first of which opened to $208 million domestically in 2015. The other two, \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d and \u201cDominion\u201d opened to $148 million and $145 million respectively.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d introduced a new main cast to the series and brought back a familiar voice in \u201cJurassic Park\u201d screenwriter David Koepp to guide the story about a dangerous hunt for dinosaur DNA (not for making dinosaurs this time, but for curing heart disease). It cost a reported $180 million net to produce, not including marketing and promotion costs.",
      "The campaign was far reaching, including a global press tour, with stops everywhere from London to Seoul, integrated marketing across NBC Universal platforms and brand tie-ins with everything from Jeep and 7-11 to Johansson\u2019s skincare line.",
      "No major new films dared go up against the dinosaurs, who left last week\u2019s champion, the Brad Pitt racing movie \u201cF1,\u201d in the dust. \u201cF1\u201d fell a modest 54% in its second weekend with $26.1 million, helping bring its domestic total to $109.5 million. It continues to play on IMAX screens with accounted for $7.6 million of the North American weekend ticket sales. Globally, it's nearing $300 million with a running total of $293.6 million.",
      "Third place went to Universal's live-action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d which earned $11 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its domestic total to $224 million. Disney and Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d landed in fourth place with $5.7 million. Globally, \u201cElio\u201d has just crossed $96 million in three weekends.",

      "LONDON -- Hard-rock royalty and some 40,000 fans gathered for an ear-splitting tribute to Ozzy Osbourne at what the heavy metal icon says was his last-ever live performance.",
      "The original lineup of Osbourne\u2019s band Black Sabbath performed at Villa Park soccer stadium in their home city of Birmingham, central England, on Saturday.",
      "The 76-year-old singer, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, sang from a black throne that rose up from under the stage.",
      "\u201cLet the madness begin!\u201d he urged as he took the stage, and later paid tribute to fans.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, man, I\u2019ve been laid up for like six years. You have no idea how I feel \u2014 thank you from the bottom of my heart,\u201d Osbourne said. \u201cYou\u2019re all \u2026 special. Let\u2019s go crazy, come on.\u201d",
      "Osbourne performed several songs solo before being joined onstage, for the first time in 20 years, by Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Terence \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler and Bill Ward. The band ended a short set with \u201cParanoid,\" one of its most famous songs.",
      "It capped a day-long metal festival that included performances from the likes of Anthrax, Metallica and Guns N\u2019Roses. Artists who sent plaudits and well-wishes included Jack Black, Dolly Parton and Elton John.",
      "\u201cYou are one of the most remarkable singers of our time,\u201d John said. \u201cYou are the king, you are the legend.\u201d",
      "Osbourne formed Black Sabbath in 1968 in Birmingham, a city then known for its heavy industry that became the crucible of the British metal scene. Black Sabbath\u2019s devil imagery and thunderous sound made them one of the era's most influential \u2014 and parent-scaring \u2014 metal acts. Both the band and Osbourne as a solo artist have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "Osbourne\u2019s fame expanded into the mainstream in the early 2000s, when he joined his wife Sharon Osbourne, and two of their children in the MTV reality TV show \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",
      "He has struggled with health issues since 2003 following a near-fatal quad bike crash. He revealed his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis in 2020 and paused touring in 2023 after spinal surgery.",

      "CARDIFF, Wales -- Oasis ended a 16-year hiatus on Friday with a punchy, powerful trip through one of Britpop's greatest songbooks, kicking off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales to a crowd ecstatic for the band's 1990s hits.",
      "And was there brotherly love between the famously feuding Gallagher siblings? Definitely maybe.",
      "Fans traveled to the Welsh capital from around the world for a show that many thought would never happen. Noel and Liam Gallagher, the heart of Oasis, had not performed together since the band's acrimonious split in 2009.",
      "One fan banner summed it up: \u201cThe great wait is over.\u201d",
      "After a montage of headlines about the sparring siblings was capped with the words \u201cthe guns have fallen silent,\u201d Oasis appeared on stage to a deafening roar, opening with the apt \u201cHello\u201d and its refrain of \u201cit\u2019s good to be back.\u201d",
      "The brothers had a brief hand-in-hand moment but largely kept their distance onstage.

      "A crowd of more than 60,000 in the Principality Stadium was treated to a well-paced two-hour set that drew heavily on the first album and its 1995 followup, \u201c(What's the Story) Morning Glory,\u201d alongside a smattering of later tracks and fan-favorite B-sides.",
      "Song like \u201cSupersonic,\u201d \u201cRoll With It\u201d and \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Star\u201d sounded as thunderous as ever and sparked mass sing-alongs.",

      "Multicolored, sometimes faintly psychedelic projections formed the main technological accoutrement to a show where the focus was squarely on the songs. There was little banter, though Liam paused between songs to check the audience was having a good time.",
      "\u201cWas it worth the 40,000 pounds you paid for the ticket?\u201d he asked at one point, referring to the scramble for seats that saw some fans pay hundreds to see a show.",

      "The show in Cardiff kicked off a 19-date Live '25 tour in the U.K. and Ireland. Then come stops in North America, South America, Asia and Australia, ending in Sao Paulo on Nov. 23.",
      "Before the show, the streets around the stadium filled with fans who gathered in groups to sing along to the band's hits and snapped up Oasis-branded bucket hats at 35 pounds ($48) each.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very, very special \u2014 emotional,\" said 44-year old Rob Maule from Edinburgh, Scotland. \"I\u2019m here with three of my friends, childhood friends, and we used to see Oasis across the country.",

      "Founded in the working-class streets of Manchester, England, in 1991, Oasis was one of the dominant British acts of the 1990s, releasing eight U.K. No. 1 albums.",
      "The band\u2019s sound was fueled by sing-along rock choruses and the combustible chemistry between guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher \u2014 a Beatles and glam rock-loving musician with a knack for memorable tunes \u2014 and younger brother Liam.",
      "Then and since, the brothers have often traded barbs \u2014 onstage, in the studio and in interviews. Liam once called Noel \u201ctofu boy,\u201d while Noel branded his brother \u201cthe angriest man you\u2019ll ever meet. He\u2019s like a man with a fork in a world of soup.\u201d",

      "The ticketing troubles sparked questions in U.K. Parliament, where Arts Minister Chris Bryant criticized \u201cpractices that see fans of live events blindsided by price hikes.\u201d Britain\u2019s competition regulator has since threatened Ticketmaster \u2014 which sold around 900,000 Oasis tickets \u2014 with legal action.",
      "No plans have been announced for Oasis to record any new music, and the tour is being presented as a one-off.",

      "The U.S. State Department's revelation that it has revoked visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan is the latest indication that the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make public points",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the United States revokes someone's visa, it is typically confidential, with few exceptions. But with British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan and others, the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make a public point when it deems a case particularly egregious.",
      "The State Department\u2019s number two diplomat made headlines when he posted a social media message this week saying visas for the band for an upcoming U.S. tour had been revoked. British police are investigating whether a crime was committed when the duo's frontman led the audience in chants of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d \u2014 the Israel Defense Forces \u2014 at a music festival in the U.K.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that their visas had been revoked \u201cin light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\u201d",
      "The band rejected claims of antisemitism and said in a statement that it was being \u201ctargeted for speaking up\u201d about the war in Gaza.",
      "Under the Immigration and Nationality Act and certain statutes related to the privacy of government documents, the State Department has for years resisted or refused to discuss specific cases in which visas may have been denied or revoked. Certain exemptions apply, such as when foreign officials and their immediate family members are found to ineligible for entry into the United States for violating anti-corruption or human rights regulations.",
      "However, as the Trump administration pursues a nationwide crackdown targeted at visa holders it believes have engaged in antisemitic or pro-militant behavior, the standard for releasing once-privileged information seems to have been relaxed.",
      "\u201cForeigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said when asked about the public announcement.",
      "She said one reason for announcing the revocations was to make clear that the administration is serious about the standards it will apply to visa holders and applicants.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been public about that standard, and this was a very public event that violated that very basic standard about the nature of who we want to let into the country,\u201d Bruce said.",
      "Other recent cases have been less clear-cut, although some have ended up in public court cases.",
      "Earlier this year, as part of an initiative to expel foreign students who are accused by the Trump administration of engaging in pro-Hamas, anti-Israel or antisemitic activity, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had rescinded at least 300 visas and expected that number to rise.",
      "Many of those cases were not publicized individually.",
      "One that was: Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained by immigration authorities in Massachusetts for authoring an opinion piece criticizing Tufts University for not taking a tougher line on alleged Israeli atrocities in Gaza.",
      "U.S. officials said at the time that her visa had been revoked because of adverse foreign policy consequences if she remained in the United States.",
      "Other high-profile and public cases of visa revocations for political reasons date back decades, including actor Charlie Chaplin in 1952 during the Truman administration and an ultimately unsuccessful deportation attempt against Beatles singer John Lennon in the 1970s.",
      "\u201cThe practice of ideological exclusion has a long history in the United States, having been used for decades as a political tool to keep U.S. audiences from being exposed to dissident viewpoints,\u201d the human rights group Amnesty International said in a 2020 report.",
      "\u201cDuring the Cold War, in particular, the U.S. government denied visas to some of the world\u2019s leading intellectuals, writers and artists who, the government thought, might promote Communism or other 'subversive' views,\u201d it said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects.

      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based coronavirus vaccine available in the U.S. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is an updated, lower-dose version of its existing mRNA-based vaccine.",

      "FDA staff reached a similar conclusion for the Moderna vaccine, deeming it similar in safety and effectiveness to the company\u2019s original shot.",
      "Last week, the FDA finalized new warning labeling about the risk of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation, on shots from Moderna and Pfizer, the other maker of an mRNA-based shot for COVID.",
      "In his \u201coverride memo,\u201d reversing FDA staff\u2019s decision on the Moderna shot, Prasad pointed to the ongoing risk of myocarditis and questions about its frequency.

      "Prices are falling for the popular obesity treatments Wegovy and Zepbound, but steady access to the drugs remains challenging.",
      "The medications still amount to around $500 per month for those without insurance \u2014 out of reach for many patients. And even for people with insurance, coverage remains uneven.",
      "\u201cThe medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,\u201d said Matt Maciejewski, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.",
      "Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there\u2019s hope that prices may fall more in the future.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.",
      "Zepbound brought in $2.3 billion in U.S. sales during this year\u2019s first quarter, making it one of drugmaker Eli Lilly\u2019s best sellers.",
      "Novo Nordisk says Wegovy has about 200,000 weekly prescriptions in the U.S., where it brought in nearly $1.9 billion in first-quarter sales.",
      "The benefits consultant Mercer says more businesses with 500 or more employees are adding coverage of the injected drugs for their workers and family members.",
      "And Novo says 85% of its patients who have coverage in the U.S. pay $25 or less per month.",
      "Plus some patients with diabetes can get coverage of the GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Mounjaro from Novo and Lilly that are approved to treat that condition.",
      "But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don\u2019t cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare, the federal program mainly for people age 65 and older.",
      "Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Dr. Beverly Tchang.",
      "Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.",
      "\u201cCoverage is not the same as access,\u201d said Tchang, a New York-based doctor who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.",
      "Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.",
      "Some big employers have dropped coverage of the drugs due to the expense. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also are starting to pick one brand over the other as they negotiate deals with the drugmakers.",
      "One of the nation\u2019s largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary, or list of covered drugs, on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.",
      "That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.",
      "Dr. Courtney Younglove\u2019s office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer\u2019s website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.",
      "\u201cThen some of them just cancel their appointment because they don\u2019t have coverage,\u201d the Overland Park, Kansas, doctor said.",
      "Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined earlier this year that the shortage had ended.",
      "That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.",
      "The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide, the drug behind Wegovy, that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.",
      "It\u2019s a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.",
      "Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by US regulators.",
      "Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.",
      "Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.",
      "Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.",
      "There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.",
      "Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.",
      "She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.",
      "\u201cI think price wars are going to drive it down,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we are in the early stages. I have hope.\u201d",

      "Fifteen police officers in the Philippines are in custody over their alleged role in the abductions and suspected killings of 34 cockfighting enthusiasts",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Fifteen police officers have been taken into custody and are being investigated for their alleged role in the abductions and feared killings of at least 34 cockfighters, the Philippine police chief said Monday.",
      "The missing people were accused of cheating in the hugely popular sport, with their bodies reportedly dumped in a scenic lake with a restive volcano.",
      "The victims went missing around 2021 and 2022 mostly while on their way to or from cockfighting arenas dotting the main northern Philippine region of Luzon, including in the metropolitan Manila capital region.",
      "The unresolved disappearances again drew public attention after a key witness recently surfaced and accused his former employer, a gambling tycoon, of masterminding the killings, with bodies reportedly dumped in Taal Lake south of Manila or burned elsewhere.",
      "National police chief Gen. Nicolas Torre III said in a news conference that a key witness, who used the alias \u201cTotoy,\u201d provided crucial details. The cockfighting aficionados and workers were strangled and mutilated before being dumped.",
      "Police investigators have corroborated the details and evidence provided by the witness which will be used in criminal complaints to be filed by the Department of Justice against the suspects, he said.",
      "The witness has told local TV networks that he decided to speak out because his former employer was allegedly threatening to have him killed. He said he wanted to help ease the agony of families of the victims who had been demanding justice for their missing kin.",
      "\u201cI was very shocked,\u201d Torre said when asked how he felt over the disclosures made by the witness, who is under police guard. \u201cIt firmed up our resolve to really solve this because what happened was savage and not acceptable by any standard.\u201d",
      "Criminal complaints will be filed against the influential businessman, who owns cockfighting arenas and other gambling businesses, and other suspects, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said. The businessman has denied the allegations.",
      "Remulla said he would ask Japan to help provide technology to help look for traces of the remains of the victims, which could still be retrieved from the bottom of Taal Lake about four years after the killings.",
      "While banned in the United States and other Western countries largely due to animal cruelty concerns, cockfighting has been a popular pastime and gambling sport in many parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Latin America and some parts of Europe.",
      "Cockfighting arenas are found prominently in far-flung rural towns and major cities across the Philippines and draw large numbers of aficionados in an industry that has become a vibrant part of the local culture and a regulated gambling business that generates state revenues and thousands of jobs. The game involves pitting two roosters \u2014 with razor-sharp gaffs or steel blades attached to their legs \u2014 in a battle often to the death amid the roar of the crowd.",
      "The missing cockfighting aficionados and workers were accused of cheating by discreetly taking steps to weaken one rooster or diminishing its chances of winning, including by slightly injuring it, then betting on the other rooster.",

    "story": [
      "Amnesty International says executions in Saudi Arabia hit a record high last year, with 345 people put to death",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Executions in Saudi Arabia surged last year to a record high, Amnesty International said Monday, as activists increasingly warn about the kingdom's use of the death penalty in nonviolent drug cases.",
      "Saudi Arabia executed 345 people last year, the highest number ever recorded by Amnesty in over three decades of reporting. In the first six months of this year alone, 180 people have been put to death, the group said, signaling that record likely will again be broken.",
      "This year, about two-thirds of those executed were convicted on non-lethal drug charges, the activist group Reprieve said separately. Amnesty also has raised similar concerns about executions in drug cases.",
      "Saudi Arabia has not offered any comment on why it increasingly employs the death penalty in the kingdom. Saudi officials did not respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press about the executions and why it is using the death penalty for nonviolent drug cases.",
      "However, it conflicts with comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's day-to-day ruler, who in 2022 highlighted he limited its use to just homicide cases.",
      "\u201cWell about the death penalty, we got rid of all of it, except for one category, and this one is written in the Quran, and we cannot do anything about it, even if we wished to do something, because it is clear teaching in the Quran,\u201d the prince told The Atlantic.",
      "Saudi Arabia is one of several countries in the Middle East, including Iran, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, that can levy the death penalty on drug-related charges. But the kingdom remains one of the world's top executioners behind only China and Iran \u2014 and its use of executions in drug cases appears to be fueling that.",
      "Amnesty documented the cases of 25 foreign nationals who are currently on death row, or were recently executed, for drug-related offenses. In those cases, Amnesty said the inmates on death row were not familiar with the legal system nor their rights, and had limited to no legal representation. Foreign nationals faced additional challenges when trying to secure a fair trial, Amnesty said. More than half of those executed this year in the kingdom were foreign nationals, according to Reprieve.",
      "One such national, Egyptian Essam Ahmed, disappeared in 2021 while working on a fishing boat in Sinai. A month later, his family received word he had been detained in Saudi Arabia and sentenced to death for drug trafficking. Ahmed claims he was forced by the boat's owner to carry a package for him at gunpoint.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in terror, we\u2019re scared every morning,\u201d said a family member of Ahmed's, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity fearing his comments could impact the case. \u201cEvery morning until 9 a.m., we\u2019re afraid that they took one of them for execution without us knowing.\u201d",
      "The family member added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have feelings. We\u2019re dead. Death would be easier. \u2026 They didn\u2019t even give me a chance to defend him and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "Human rights groups for years have been critical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record. There also have been rapid societal changes in Saudi Arabia under King Salman and the crown prince. While pushing for women to drive, the kingdom has overseen the arrest of women\u2019s rights activists. While calling for foreign investment, Saudi Arabia also has imprisoned businessmen, royals and others in a crackdown on corruption that soon resembled a shakedown of the kingdom\u2019s most powerful people.",
      "In 2021, as part of the crown prince\u2019s criminal justice overhaul, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Human Rights Commission announced a moratorium on drug-related executions. The moratorium, however, remained in place for just under three years, before it was scrapped without an explanation.",
      "The executions also come as the kingdom continues to undertake bold reforms to diversify its economy as part of its \u201cVision 2030\u201d initiative.",
      "Jeed Basyouni, who directs Britain-based legal nonprofit Reprieve\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program, insisted Prince Mohammed could change Saudi Arabia's execution policy rapidly if he wanted.",
      "\u201cHe could do mass pardons. He could insist on rewriting laws so that they are in line with international law,\" Basyouni said. \u201cThe billions spent on so-called reforms, designed to promote a more tolerant and inclusive kingdom under the crown prince\u2019s rule, mask an authoritarian state where daily executions for drug crimes are now the norm.\"",

      "Thirty-two defendants are on trial over a deadly fire at a Turkish ski resort hotel that killed 78 people and injured 133",
      "ISTANBUL -- A total of 32 defendants went on trial on Monday over a deadly fire that tore through a popular ski resort hotel, killing 78 people and injuring 133 others.",
      "The Jan. 21 fire hit the 12-story Grand Kartal Hotel at the Kartalkaya ski resort in the province of Bolu during the winter school break. Dozens of children taking family vacations were among the victims.",
      "The tragedy, which saw guests and staff jump out of windows to escape smoke and flame-filled rooms or dangle sheets out of windows to lower themselves down, sent shockwaves across Turkey and sparked widespread calls for accountability over negligence and safety violations.",
      "Thirteen of the defendants face potential jail terms of 1,998 years each on charges of killing or wounding with possible intent, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency, citing a 98-page indictment from the Bolu Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The 19 others are charged with negligently causing death or injury, for which they could be jailed for 22\u00bd years.",
      "With 210 plaintiffs and 32 defendants involved in the high-profile case, the trial is taking place at a sports center in Bolu that has been temporarily converted into a 700-seat courtroom to accommodate the proceedings, Anadolu reported.",
      "On Monday, family members and friends of the victims staged a demonstration outside the sports center, holding up posters of their loved ones and demanding justice.",
      "\u201cThis is not neglect, it is murder,\u201d the Anadolu Agency quoted Zeynep Kotan, the mother of 17-year-old Omur Kotan, who lost her life in the fire, as saying.",
      "The fire started at 3.17 a.m. local time as a spark from an electric grill plate in the fourth-floor kitchen lit a nearby garbage bin before melting the hose of a liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, and igniting the gas.",
      "Staff first noticed the flames at 3.24 a.m. and called the emergency services but within two minutes the blaze had \u201cexceeded controllable limits,\u201d according to the indictment.",
      "The blaze took hold of the wooden ceiling, accelerated by the flow of air from a door left open by escaping kitchen staff.",
      "The indictment says that inadequate measures on the stairs and elevators and the lack of a smoke extraction system caused flammable and toxic fumes to swiftly spread to the upper floors, filling corridors with smoke.",
      "The lack of emergency alarms, faulty fire detection and warning systems and insufficient staff fire training meant the hotel\u2019s 238 guests were not alerted to the blaze in time.",
      "Escape routes through the stairways and emergency exits were not properly fitted and there was no sprinkler system, turning the hotel\u2019s stairwells and life shafts into \u201cchimneys\u201d for the smoke to quickly reach the upper floors.",
      "The indictment adds that the absence of emergency lighting, fire escape signs and alternative exits stopped the safe evacuation of guests.",
      "The 14-day trial will hear that legal responsibility lay with owner Halit Ergul and company board members, including his wife and daughters, and managers.",
      "Also facing the higher punishment are Bolu\u2019s deputy mayor and deputy fire chief. Those facing the lesser charges consist of hotel staff, inspection officials and maintenance workers.",
      "The hotel first opened in 1999 and has been operated by Ergul\u2019s company since 2007.",
      "In a statement to prosecutors made within days of the fire, Ergul said the hotel was checked for fire safety every two years by government-authorized inspectors before receiving a tourism certificate, allowing it to operate. The most recent certificate was due to expire in March.",
      "The hotel\u2019s last inspection by the Culture and Tourism Ministry was conducted five weeks before the fire, Ergul said.",

Pressure has been mounting after far-right groups in Poland have alleged Germany was transporting migrants into Polish territory after they reached Western Europe.",
      "The reinstated controls, which began overnight Sunday, will last for an initial period of 30 days, though authorities have not ruled out extending them, according to the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration.",
      "\u201cIllegal migration is simply a crime,\u201d Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said Sunday during a news conference.",

      "PAMPLONA, Spain -- Thousands of daredevils ran, skidded and tumbled out of the way of a stampeding group of bulls at the opening run of the San Ferm\u00edn festival Monday.",
      "It was the first of nine morning runs or \u201cencierros\u201d during the famous celebrations held in the northern Spanish city of Pamplona.",
      "The bulls pounded along the twisting cobblestone streets after being led by six steers. Up to 4,000 runners take part in each bull run, which takes place over 846 meters (2,775 feet) and can last two to four minutes.",
      "Most runners wear the traditional garb of white trousers and shirt with red sash and neckerchief. The expert Spanish runners try to sprint just in front of the bull's horns for a few death-defying seconds while egging the animal on with a rolled newspaper.",
      "Thousands of spectators watched from balconies and wooden barricades along the course. Millions more follow the visceral spectacle on live television.",
      "The festival kicked off Sunday with the traditional \u201cchupinazo\u201d firework blast after which revelers doused one another with red or sparkling wine.",
      "While gorings are not rare, many more people are bruised and injured in falls and pileups with each other. Medics rush in to treat the injured and take the seriously hurt to a hospital.",
      "On Monday, Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that a few revelers had been injured, but it wasn\u2019t clear if their injuries were from gorings.",
      "Unofficial records say at least 15 people have died in the bull runs over the past century. The deadliest day on record was July 13, 1980, when four runners were killed by two bulls. The last death was in 2009.",
      "The rest of each day is for eating, drinking, dancing and cultural entertainment, including bull fights where the animals that run in the morning are slain in the bull ring by professional matadors each afternoon.",
      "The festival isn't without its detractors. On Saturday, animal rights activists marched through Pamplona wearing horns and splotched with fake blood in protest against the San Fermin bull runs. Some held up signs saying \u201cbullfights are a sin.\u201d",
      "The festival was made internationally famous by Ernest Hemingway\u2019s classic 1926 novel \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d about American bohemians wasting away in Europe.",

      "Syria is working to rebuild its energy sector after years of civil war and crippling sanctions",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Abdulrazak al-Jenan swept the dust off his solar panel on his apartment roof overlooking Damascus. Syria's largest city was mostly pitch-black, the few speckles of light coming from the other households able to afford solar panels, batteries, or private generators.",
      "Al-Jenan went thousands of dollars in debt to buy his solar panel in 2019. It was an expensive coping mechanism at the time, but without it, he couldn't charge his phone and run the refrigerator.",
      "Syria has not had more than four hours of state electricity per day for years, as a result of the nearly 14-year civil war that ended with the ouster of former President Bashar Assad in December.",
      "Syria's new leaders are hoping renewable energy will now become more than a patchwork solution. Investment is beginning to return to the country with the lifting of U.S. sanctions, and major energy projects are planned, including an industrial-scale solar farm that would secure about a tenth of the country's energy needs.",
      "\u201cThe solution to the problem isn\u2019t putting solar panels on roofs,\u201d Syria\u2019s interim Energy Minister Mohammad al-Bashir told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s securing enough power for the families through our networks in Syria. This is what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d",
      "Some of the efforts focus on simply repairing infrastructure destroyed in the war. The World Bank recently announced a $146 million grant to help Syria repair damaged transmission lines and transformer substations. Al-Bashir said Syria's infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country's needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation. With the sanctions lifted, that supply could come in soon.",
      "More significantly, Syria recently signed a $7 billion energy deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and American companies. The program over the next three and a half years would develop four combined-cycle gas turbines with a total generating capacity estimated at approximately 4,000 megawatts and a 1,000-megawatt solar farm. This would \u201cbroadly secure the needs\u201d of Syrians, said Al-Bashir.",
      "While Syria is initially focusing on fixing its existing fossil fuel infrastructure to improve quality of life, help make businesses functional again, and entice investors, the U.N. Development Program said in May that a renewable energy plan will be developed in the next year for the country.",
      "The plan will look at Syria\u2019s projected energy demand and determine how much of it can come from renewable sources.",
      "\u201cGiven the critical role of energy in Syria\u2019s recovery, we have to rapidly address energy poverty and progressively accelerate the access to renewable energy,\u201d Sudipto Mukerjee, UNDP\u2019s resident representative in Syria, said in a statement announcing the plan.",
      "While the war caused significant damage to Syria's infrastructure, crippling Washington-led sanctions imposed during the Assad dynasty's decades of draconian rule made it impossible for Syria to secure fuel and spare parts to generate power.",
      "\u201cMany companies over the past period would tell us the sanctions impact matters like imports, implementing projects, transferring funds and so on,\u201d al-Bashir said.",
      "During a visit to Turkey in May, the minister said Syria could only secure about 1700 megawatts, a little less than 20%, of its energy needs.",
      "A series of executive orders by U.S. President Donald Trump lifted many sanctions on Syria, aiming to end the country\u2019s isolation from the global banking system so that it can become viable again and rebuild itself.",
      "The United Nations estimates the civil war caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and economic losses across the country. Some 90% of Syrians live in poverty. Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.",
      "\u201cAny kind of economic recovery needs a functional energy sector,\u201d said Joseph Daher, Syrian-Swiss economist and researcher, who said that stop-gap measures like solar panels and private generators were luxuries only available to a few who could afford it. \u201cThere is also a need to diminish the cost of electricity in Syria, which is one of the most expensive in the region.\u201d",
      "Prices for electricity in recent years surged as the country under its former rulers struggled with currency inflation and rolling back on subsidies. The new officials who inherited the situation say that lifting sanctions will help them rectify the country's financial and economic woes, and provide sufficient and affordable electricity as soon as they can.",
      "\u201cThe executive order lifts most of the obstacles for political and economic investment with Syria,\" said Qutaiba Idlibi, who leads the Americas section of the Foreign Ministry.",
      "Syria has been under Washington-led sanctions for decades, but designations intensified during the war that started in 2011. Even with some waivers for humanitarian programs, it was difficult to bring in resources and materials to fix Syria\u2019s critical infrastructure \u2014 especially electricity \u2014 further compounding the woes of the vast majority of Syrians, who live in poverty.",
      "The removal of sanctions signals to U.S. businesses that Trump is serious in his support for Syria's recovery, Idlibi said.",
      "\u201cRight now, we have a partnership with the United States as any normal country would do,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Al-Jenan is able to turn on both his fans on a hot summer day while he watches the afternoon news on TV, as the temperature rises to 35 degrees Celsius (95 F). He doesn\u2019t want to let go of his solar panel but hopes the lifting of sanctions will eventually bring sustainable state electricity across the country.",
      "\u201cWe can at least know what\u2019s going on in the country and watch on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really were cut off from the entire world.\u201d",

      "French police have intensified efforts to stop migrants crossing the English Channel",
      "ECAULT BEACH, France -- Across the English Channel, the U.K.'s white cliffs beckon. On fine days, men and women with children in their arms and determination in their eyes can see the shoreline of what they believe will be a promised land as they attempt the perilous crossing clandestinely, ditching belongings to squeeze aboard flimsy inflatable boats that set to sea from northern France.",
      "In a flash, on one recent crossing attempt, French police swooped in with knives, wading into the water and slashing the boat's thin rubber \u2014 literally deflating the migrants' hopes and dreams.",
      "Some of the men put up dispirited resistance, trying to position themselves \u2014 in vain \u2014 between the boat and the officers' blades. One splashed water at them, another hurled a shoe. Cries of \u201cNo! No!\" rang out. A woman wailed.",
      "But the team of three officers, one also holding a pepper-gas canister, lunged at the boat again and again, pitching some of those aboard into the surf as it quickly deflated. The Associated Press obtained video of the police boat-slashing, filmed on a beach near the French port of Boulogne.",
      "France's northern coast has long been fortified against invasion, with Nazi bunkers in World War II and pre-French Revolution forts. Now, France is defending beaches with increasing aggression against migrants trying at a record pace to go the other way \u2014 out to sea, to the U.K.",
      "Under pressure from U.K. authorities, France's government is preparing to give an even freer hand to police patrols that, just last week, were twice filmed slashing boats carrying men, women and children.",
      "The video obtained by AP was filmed Monday. Four days later, on \u00c9cault beach south of Boulogne, the BBC filmed police wading into the surf and puncturing another boat with box cutters, again pitching people into the water as it deflated.",
      "An AP journalist who arrived moments later counted multiple lacerations and saw dispirited people, some still wearing life jackets, clambering back up sand dunes toward woods inland. There, AP had spent the previous night with families and men waiting for a crossing, sleeping rough in a makeshift camp without running water or other basic facilities. Exhausted children cried as men sang songs and smoked around a campfire.",
      "The French Interior Ministry told AP that police haven't been issued orders to systematically slash boats. But the British government \u2014 which is partly funding France's policing efforts \u2014 welcomed what it called a \u201ctoughening\u201d of the French approach. The U.K. is also pushing France to go further and let officers intervene against boats in deeper waters, a change the government in Paris is considering. Campaigners for migrant rights and a police union warn that doing so could endanger both migrants and officers.",
      "Of the slashing filmed Friday by the BBC, the Interior Ministry said the boat was in distress, overloaded and riding low in the water, with migrants \"trying to climb aboard from the back, risking being caught by the propeller.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe gendarmes, in water up to their knees, intervened to rescue people in danger, pull the boat to shore and neutralize it,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Around the campfire, the men stared into the flames and ruminated. Deniz, a Kurd with an infectious laugh and a deep singing voice, wanted more than anything to cross the channel in time to celebrate his 44th birthday in August with his 6-year-old daughter, Eden, who lives with her mother in the U.K. Like nearly all the migrating people that AP interviewed, surviving in camps that police frequently dismantle, Deniz didn't want to give his full name.",
      "Refused a short-stay U.K. visa, Deniz said he had no other option than the sea route, but four attempts ended with police wrecking the boats. He said that on one of those occasions, his group of around 40 people begged an officer patrolling alone to turn a blind eye and let them take to sea.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018No,\u2019 nobody going to stop him. We could stop him, but we didn\u2019t want, you know, to hurt him or we didn\u2019t want to argue with him,\u201d Deniz said. \u201cWe just let him, and he cut it with a knife.\u201d",
      "He believes that U.K. funding of French policing is turning officers into zealots.",
      "\u201cI say, 'Because of the money, you are not France soldiers, you\u2019re not France police. You are the English dogs now,\" he said.",
      "The coastal battle between police and migrants never lets up, no matter the hour or weather. Drones and aircraft watch the beaches and gendarmes patrol them aboard buggies and on foot. On \u00c9cault beach, a WWII Nazi gun emplacement serves as their lookout post.",
      "Inland waterways have been sealed off with razor wire and floating barriers to prevent launches of so-called \u201ctaxi boats.\" They motor to offshore pickup points, where waiting migrants then wade into the sea and climb aboard, children in their arms and on their shoulders.",
      "AP saw a 6 a.m. pickup Friday on Hardelot beach south of Boulogne. Many dozens of people squeezed aboard, straddling the sausage-like inflated sides \u2014 one foot in the sea, the other in the boat. It left about a half-dozen people on the beach, some in the water, apparently for lack of room. Gendarmes on the beach watched it motor slowly away.",
      "Campaigners who work with migrants fear that allowing police to intervene against boats farther offshore will panic those aboard, risking casualties. French officials are examining the possibility of police interventions up to 300 meters (980 feet) from the water's edge.",
      "\u201cAll that will happen is that people will take greater and greater risks,\u201d said Diane Leon, who coordinates aid efforts for the group M\u00e9decins du Monde along the coast. \u201cThe police entering the water \u2014 this was something that, until now, we saw only rarely. But for us, it raises fears of panic during boarding or of boats arriving farther and farther out, forcing people to swim to reach the taxi boats.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, police union official R\u00e9gis Debut voiced concerns about potential legal ramifications for officers if people drown during police attempts to stop departures. He said officers weighed down by equipment could also drown.",
      "\u201cOur colleagues don't want to cross 300 meters to intercept the small boats. Because, in fact, we're not trained for that,\u201d said Debut, of the union UNSA Police.",
      "\u201cYou also need to have the proper equipment. You can\u2019t carry out an arrest wearing combat boots, a police uniform and the bullet-proof vest. So the whole process needs to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Around the campfire, men laughed off the risks of the crossings that French authorities say claimed nearly 80 lives last year. They had nothing left to lose and the channel was just one more hardship after tortuous journeys to France filled with difficulties and misery, they said.",
      "\u201cWe will never give up,\u201d Deniz said.",
      "According to U.K. government figures, more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of this year, up by about 50% from the same period in 2024, and potentially on course toward a new annual record. About 37,000 people were detected crossing in 2024, the second-highest annual figure after 46,000 in 2022.",
      "Qassim, a 26-year-old Palestinian, messaged AP after crossing last week with his wife and their daughters, aged 6 and 4. The boat labored through waves for eight hours, he said.",
      "\u201cEveryone was praying,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe were patient and endured and saw death. The children were crying and screaming.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we feel comfortable, safe, and stable. We are starting a new page,\" he wrote. \u201cWe will do our best to protect our children and ourselves and to make up for the difficult years we have been exposed to.\"",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia\u2019s rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted Monday, sending a column of volcanic materials as high as 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky, depositing ash on villages and leading to flight cancellations.",
      "The volcano has been at the highest alert level since last month and no casualties were immediately reported.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the volcano's slopes. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off volcanic earthquakes.",
      "The column of hot clouds that rose into the sky was the volcano's highest since the major eruption in November 2024  that killed nine people and injured dozens, said Muhammad Wafid, the Geology Agency chief. It also erupted in March.",
      "\u201cAn eruption of that size certainly carries a higher potential for danger, including its impact on aviation,\u201d Wafid told The Associated Press from Switzerland where he was attending a seminar. \u201cWe shall reevaluate to enlarge its danger zone that must be cleared of villagers and tourist activities.\u201d",
      "The volcano monitoring agency had increased the alert status for Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki to the highest level after an eruption on June 18, and more than doubled an exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius since then as eruptions became more frequent.",

      "Australian woman Erin Patterson has been found guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives, who died after she deliberately served them poisonous mushrooms for lunch",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian woman Erin Patterson was found guilty Monday of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "The jury in the Supreme Court trial in Victoria state returned a verdict after six days of deliberations, following a nine-week trial that gripped Australia. Patterson faces life in prison and will be sentenced later, but a date for the hearing hasn't yet been scheduled.",
      "Patterson, who sat in the dock between two prison officers, showed no emotion but blinked rapidly as the verdicts were read.",
      "Three of Patterson\u2019s four lunch guests \u2014 her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson \u2014 died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Heather\u2019s husband, who survived the meal.",
      "It wasn\u2019t disputed that Patterson served the mushrooms or that the pastries killed her guests. The jury was required to decide whether she knew the lunch contained death caps, and if she intended for them to die.",
      "The guilty verdicts, which were required to be unanimous, indicated that jurors rejected Patterson\u2019s defense that the presence of the poisonous fungi in the meal was a terrible accident, caused by the mistaken inclusion of foraged mushrooms that she didn\u2019t know were death caps. Prosecutors didn\u2019t offer a motive for the killings, but during the trial highlighted strained relations between Patterson and her estranged husband and frustration that she had felt about his parents in the past.",
      "The case turned on the question of whether Patterson meticulously planned a triple murder or accidentally killed three people she loved, including her children\u2019s only surviving grandparents. Her lawyers said she had no reason to do so \u2014 she had recently moved to a beautiful new home, was financially comfortable, had sole custody of her children and was due to begin studying for a degree in nursing and midwifery.",
      "But prosecutors suggested Patterson had two faces \u2014 the woman who publicly appeared to have a good relationship with her parents-in-law, while her private feelings about them were kept hidden. Her relationship with her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal lunch but didn\u2019t go, deteriorated in the year before the deaths, the prosecution said.",
      "The simplest facts of what happened that day and immediately afterward were hardly disputed. But Patterson\u2019s motivations for what she did and why were pored over in detail during the lengthy trial, at which more than 50 witnesses were called.",
      "The individual beef Wellington pastries Patterson served her guests were one point of friction because the recipe she used contained directions for a single, family-sized portion. Prosecutors said that she reverted to individual servings, so she could lace the other diners\u2019 portions, but not her own, with the fatal fungi \u2014 but Patterson said that she was unable to find the correct ingredients to make the recipe as directed.",
      "Nearly every other detail of the fateful day was scrutinized at length, including why Patterson sent her children out to a film before her guests arrived, why she added additional dried mushrooms to the recipe from her pantry, why she didn\u2019t become ill when the other diners did, and why she disposed of a food dehydrator after the deaths and told investigators that she didn\u2019t own one.",
      "Patterson acknowledged some lies during her evidence \u2014 including that she\u2019d never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator. But she said that those claims were made in panic as she realized her meal had killed people.",
      "She said she didn\u2019t become as ill as the other diners since she vomited after the meal because of an eating disorder. She denied that she told her guests she had cancer as a ruse to explain why she invited them to her home that day.",
      "The bizarre and tragic case has lingered in the minds of Australians and has provoked fervor among the public and media. During the trial, five separate podcasts analyzed each day of the proceedings and several news outlets ran live blogs giving moment-by-moment accounts of more than two months of evidence.",
      "At least one television drama and a documentary about the case are slated for production. Prominent Australian crime writers were seen in court throughout the trial.",
      "As it emerged half an hour before the verdict that the court was reconvening, about 40 members of the public queued outside the courthouse in the rural town of Morwell in the hope of watching the outcome in person. News outlets reported that family members of the victims were not among those present.",
      "Before the verdict, newspapers published photos of black privacy screens erected at the entrance to Erin Patterson\u2019s home. Dozens of reporters from throughout Australia and from news outlets abroad crowded around friends of Patterson's as they left the courthouse Monday.",
      "\u201cI'm saddened, but it is what it is,\u201d said one friend, Ali Rose Prior, who wore sunglasses and fought back tears. Asked what she thought Patterson felt as the verdicts were read, Prior said, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "Prior, who attended every day of the trial, confirmed Patterson had told her: \u201cSee you soon.\u201d Prior said she would visit her friend in prison.",

      "Fifty-two people died and more than 770 were wounded when four British men inspired by al-Qaida blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus during the morning rush hour on July 7, 2005. They were the first suicide bombings on European soil.",
      "Two weeks later, four other bombers attempted a similar attack, but their devices failed to explode. No one was hurt.",
      "The bombings remain seared into London\u2019s collective memory, and the anniversary was being marked with events including a ceremony at the 7/7 memorial in Hyde Park and a service of commemoration at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.",
      "At 8:50 a.m., the moment the first bomb exploded 20 years ago, Starmer and London Mayor Sadiq Khan laid wreaths at the Hyde Park monument, a group of 52 steel columns commemorating the people who were killed. At subway stations near where the explosions hit, staff and commuters paused for a minute's silence.",

      "Biddle also recalled the \u201cphenomenal act of bravery\u201d of an injured fellow passenger who crawled along the tunnel, administered emergency first aid and helped save his life.",

      "The arrest of eight Vermont dairy farmers in April sent shock waves throughout New England's agriculture industry, and fears haven't abated since then given the mixed messages from the White House",
      "MONTPELIER, Vt. -- After six 12-hour shifts milking cows, Jos\u00e9 Molina-Aguilar's lone day off was hardly relaxing.",
      "On April 21, he and seven co-workers were arrested on a Vermont dairy farm in what advocates say was one of the state\u2019s largest-ever immigration raids.",
      "\u201cI saw through the window of the house that immigration were already there, inside the farm, and that\u2019s when they detained us,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cI was in the process of asylum, and even with that, they didn\u2019t respect the document that I was still holding in my hands.\u201d",
      "Four of the workers were swiftly deported to Mexico. Molina-Aguilar, released after a month in a Texas detention center with his asylum case still pending, is now working at a different farm and speaking out.",
      "\u201cWe must fight as a community so that we can all have, and keep fighting for, the rights that we have in this country,\u201d he said.",
      "The owner of the targeted farm declined to comment. But Brett Stokes, a lawyer representing the detained workers, said the raid sent shock waves through the entire Northeast agriculture industry.",
      "\u201cThese strong-arm tactics that we\u2019re seeing and these increases in enforcement, whether legal or not, all play a role in stoking fear in the community,\u201d said Stokes, director of the Center for Justice Reform Clinic at Vermont Law and Graduate School.",
      "That fear remains given the mixed messages coming from the White House. President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally, last month paused arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels. But less than a week later, the assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security said worksite enforcement would continue.",
      "Such uncertainty is causing problems in big states like California, where farms produce more than three-quarters of the country\u2019s fruit and more than a third of its vegetables. But it\u2019s also affecting small states like Vermont, where dairy is as much a part of the state\u2019s identity as its famous maple syrup.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of all milk production in New England comes from Vermont, where more than half the state\u2019s farmland is dedicated to dairy and dairy crops. There are roughly 113,000 cows and 7,500 goats spread across 480 farms, according to the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, which pegs the industry\u2019s annual economic impact at $5.4 billion.",
      "That impact has more than doubled in the last decade, with widespread help from immigrant labor. More than 90% of the farms surveyed for the agency\u2019s recent report employed migrant workers.",
      "Among them is Wuendy Bernardo, who has lived on a Vermont dairy farm for more than a decade and has an active application to stop her deportation on humanitarian grounds: Bernardo is the primary caregiver for her five children and her two orphaned younger sisters, according to a 2023 letter signed by dozens of state lawmakers.",
      "Hundreds of Bernardo's supporters showed up for her most recent check-in with immigration officials.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult because every time I come here, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be going back to my family or not,\u201d she said after being told to return in a month.",
      "Like Molina-Aguilar, Rossy Alfaro also worked 12-hour days with one day off per week on a Vermont farm. Now an advocate with Migrant Justice, she said the dairy industry would collapse without immigrant workers.",
      "\u201cIt would all go down,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many people working long hours, without complaining, without being able to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to work.\u2019 They just do the job.\u201d",

She's referring to the process of mixing crushed grains with hot water to release sugars, which will later ferment. \"It\u2019s where the beer and everything starts.\u201d",
      "Nxusani-Mawela's classes began in early June. Students will spend six months exploring beer varieties, both international and African, before another six months on work placement.",
      "Nxusani-Mawela's Tolokazi brewery is in the Johannesburg suburb of Wynberg, wedged between the poor Black township of Alexandra on one side and the glitzy financial district of Sandton \u2014 known as Africa's richest square mile \u2014 on the other.",
      "She hails from the rural town of Butterworth, some 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away, and first came across the idea of a career in beer at a university open day in Johannesburg. She started brewing as an amateur in 2007. She has a microbiology degree and sees beer making as a good option for those with a science background.",
      "\u201cI sort of fell in love with the combination of the business side with the science, with the craftsmanship and the artistic element of brewing,\u201d she said.",
      "For the mother of two boys, beer brewing is also ripe for a shakeup.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make sure that being the first Black female to own a brewery in South Africa, that I\u2019m not the first and the last,\u201d she said. \u201cBrewsters Academy for me is about transforming the industry ... What I want to see is that in five, 10 years from now that it should be a norm to have Black people in the industry, it should be a norm to have females in the industry.\"",
      "South Africa's beer industry supports more than 200,000 jobs and contributes $5.2 billion to South Africa\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the most current Oxford Economics research in \u201cBeer\u2019s Global Economic Footprint.\u201d While South Africa's brewing sector remains male-dominated, like most places, efforts are underway to include more women.",
      "One young woman at the classes, 24-year-old Lehlohonolo Makhethe, noted women were historically responsible for brewing beer in some African cultures, and she sees learning the skill as reclaiming a traditional role.",
      "\"How it got male dominated, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Makhethe said. \u201cI\u2019d rather say we are going back to our roots as women to doing what we started.\u201d",
      "While Nxusani-Mawela teaches all kinds of styles, she also is on a mission to keep alive traditional African beer for the next generation. Her Wild African Soul beer, a collaboration with craft beer company Soul Barrel Brewing, was the 2025 African Beer Cup champion. It's a blend of African Umqombothi beer \u2014 a creamy brew incorporating maize and sorghum malt \u2014 with a fruity, fizzy Belgian Saison beer.",
      "\u201cUmqombothi is our African way, and everybody should know how to make it, but we don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that the beer styles that we make need to reflect having an element of our past being brought into the future.\u201d",
      "She's used all sorts of uniquely African flavors in her Tolokazi line, including the marula fruit and the rooibos bush that's native to South Africa and better-known for being used in a popular caffeine-free tea.",
      "\u201cWho could have thought of rooibos beer?\u201d said Lethabo Seipei Kekae after trying the beer for the first time at a beer festival. \u201cIt\u2019s so smooth. Even if you are not a beer drinker, you can drink it.\u201d",

      "A security firm said it appeared bomb-carrying drone boats hit the ship.",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Crew members abroad a ship set ablaze by a series of attacks in the Red Sea abandoned the vessel Sunday night as it took on water, marking the first serious assault in the vital corridor for trade after a monthslong campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels there.",
      "Suspicion for the attack immediately fell on the Houthis, particularly as a security firm said it appeared bomb-carrying drone boats hit the ship after it was targeted by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. The rebels' media reported on the attack but did not claim it. It can take them hours or even days before they acknowledge an assault.",
      "A renewed Houthi campaign against shipping could again draw in U.S. and Western forces to the area, particularly after President Donald Trump targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.",
      "And it comes at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most-sensitive atomic sites amid an Israeli war against the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cIt likely serves as a message that the Houthis continue to possess the capability and willingness to strike at strategic maritime targets regardless of diplomatic developments,\u201d wrote Mohammad al-Basha, a Yemen analyst at the Basha Report risk advisory firm.",
      "The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center first said that an armed security team on the unidentified vessel had returned fire against an initial attack and that the \u201csituation is ongoing.\u201d It described the attack as happening some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the country's Houthi rebels.",
      "\u201cAuthorities are investigating,\u201d it said. It later said the ship was on fire after being \u201cstruck by unknown projectiles.\"",
      "Ambrey, a private maritime security firm, issued an alert saying that a merchant ship had been \u201cattacked by eight skiffs while transiting northbound in the Red Sea.\u201d",
      "Ambrey later said the ship also had been attacked by bomb-carrying drone boats, which could mark a major escalation. It said two drone boats struck the ship, while another two had been destroyed by the armed guards on board.",
      "The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said the ship was taking on water and its crew had abandoned the vessel.",
      "The U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet referred questions to the military's Central Command, which said it was aware of the incident without elaborating.",
      "Authorities did not identify the vessel for hours. However, the description of the vessel targeted matched against the Liberian-flagged bulk tanker Magic Seas, which had been broadcasting it had an armed security team on board in the vicinity the attack took place and had been heading north. EOS Risk Group, another maritime security firm, identified the targeted vessel as being a Liberian-flagged ship as well.",
      "The Magic Seas' owners did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Houthi rebels have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The group's al-Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged the attack occurred, but offered no other comment on it as it aired a speech by its secretive leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi. However, Ambrey said the vessel targeted met \u201cthe established Houthi target profile,\" without elaborating.",
      "Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis haven't attacked a vessel, though they have continued occasional missile attacks targeting Israel. On Sunday, the group claimed launching a missile at Israel which the Israeli military said it intercepted. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, a wider, decadelong war in Yemen between the Houthis and the country\u2019s exiled government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, remains in a stalemate. The Yemeni Coast Guard, which is loyal to the exiled government, has engaged in a firefight with at least one vessel in the Red Sea in the past as well.",
      "Pirates from Somalia also have operated in the region, though typically they've sought to capture vessels either to rob or ransom their crews. But neither the Yemeni Coast Guard nor the pirates have been known to use drone boats in their attacks.",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s largest trade partner is awaiting word on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on its goods",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 America\u2019s largest trade partner, the European Union, is among the entities awaiting word Monday on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on their goods, a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.",
      "Expressing displeasure the EU's stance in trade talks, however, the president said he would jack up the tariff rate for European exports to 50%. A rate that high could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals much more expensive in the U.S.",
      "The EU, whose 27 member nations operate as a single economic bloc, said its leaders hoped to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.",
      "Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union.",
      "A lot of money is at stake in the trade talks.",
      "The EU's executive commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as \"the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.",
      "The biggest U.S. export to Europe is crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment. Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.",
      "Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($233 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.",
      "The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.",
      "Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.",
      "But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.",
      "Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.",
      "Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.",
      "\u201cOn the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. \u201cThey cannot change the way they run the EU\u2019s vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\u201d",
      "Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.",
      "Mercedes-Benz dealers in the US. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \u201csignificant increases\u201d in coming years.",
      "Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.",
      "Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.",
      "France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April.",
      "Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.",
      "\u201cIf we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\u201d Arnault said. \u201cAnd if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\u201d",
      "Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail. Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday\u2019s deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.",
      "The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \u201cthe U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of \u2018retaliatory\u2019 tariffs well beyond 10%,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cHowever, the road to get there could be rocky.\u201d",
      "The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.",
      "\u201cWhile Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a \u2018win\u2019 for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\u201d Schmieding said.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for home shoppers facing rising home prices",
      "NEW YORK -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for potential buyers who have wrestled with rising home prices.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.67% from 6.77% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.95%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell to 5.80% from 5.89% last week. A year ago, it was 6.25%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "High borrowing costs are also putting pressure on the new home market. Last week, the government reported that sales of new U.S. homes fell nearly 14% in May from the previous month.",
      "Recent data suggests sales could pick up in the coming months, especially with the recent decline in mortgage rates. A seasonally adjusted index of pending U.S. home sales rose 1.8% in May from the previous month and increased 1.1% from May last year, the National Association of Realtors said last week.",
      "There\u2019s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.33% at midday Thursday, down from 4.58% just a few weeks ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "Mortgage rates have now fallen five weeks in a row, reflecting the recent pullback in bond yields.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates appears to have encouraged some home shoppers. Last week, mortgage applications rose 2.7% from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "NEW YORK -- Nissan is recalling more than 480,000 of its vehicles across the U.S. and Canada due to potential manufacturing defects that could cause engine failure.",
      "The recall covers certain Nissan Rogues between 2021-2024 model years and 2019-2020 Altimas \u2014 as well as a number of 2019-2022 Infiniti QX50s and 2022 Infiniti QX55s sold under the automaker's luxury brand, according to Nissan and documents published by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week.",
      "The vehicles impacted carry specific \u201cVC-Turbo\u201d engines that may have manufacturing defects in their bearings, the NHTSA's recall report notes. This may cause engine damage and possibly lead to engine failure while driving, the regulator warns \u2014 increasing crash risks.",
      "Engine bearing failures \u201care not typically instantaneous and tend to progress over time,\u201d the NHTSA\u2019s recall report notes. That means effected drivers may see multiple warning signs to look out for \u2014 including abnormal noises or malfunction indicator lights.",
      "In the U.S., 443,899 vehicles are covered in this recall, per NHTSA documents. And in Canada, 37,837 are affected, a Nissan spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "As a remedy, the NHSTA's recall report notes, Nissan and Infiniti dealers will inspect the engine pan of these-now recalled cars \u2014 and repair or replace the engine if necessary. The recall covers vehicles with either 3-cylinder 1.5L or 4-cylinder 2.0L VC-Turbo engines. Potential repairs \u2014 which will be performed free of charge \u2014 will depend on the engine and whether or not debris is detected during the inspection.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nissan said it initiated this recall as part of its \u201congoing commitment to customer safety.\u201d And in late August, the company added, notification letters will be mailed out to affected owners \"with instructions to bring their vehicle to a Nissan dealer or INFINITI retailer for inspection and repair if necessary.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site or Nissan's recall lookup.",

      "Ukrainian authorities are enlisting European help to increase domestic military production as the United States pauses some weapons shipments to Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The decision by the United States to pause some weapons shipments to Ukraine has come at a tough time for Kyiv: Russia\u2019s bigger army is making a concerted push on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and is intensifying long-range drone and missile attacks that increasingly hammer civilians in Ukrainian cities.",
      "Washington has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022. But the Trump administration has been disengaging from the war, and no end to the fighting is in sight, despite recent direct peace talks.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Ukraine\u2019s options following the U.S. pause of some arms deliveries:",
      "Amid recurring concerns in Kyiv about how much military support its allies can supply and how quickly, Ukraine has raced to build up its domestic defense industry.",
      "The country's output has gradually grown, especially in the production of more and increasingly sophisticated drones, but Ukraine needs to speedily scale up production.",
      "Crucially, some high-tech U.S. weapons are irreplaceable. They include Patriot air defense missiles, which are needed to fend off Russia\u2019s frequent ballistic missile attacks, but which cost $4 million each. That vital system is included in the pause, and many cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, could become increasingly vulnerable.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official said Thursday that Patriot systems are \u201ccritically necessary\u201d for Ukraine, but U.S.-made HIMARS precision-guided missiles, also paused, are in less urgent need as other countries produce similar assets.",
      "\u201cOther countries that have these (Patriot) systems can only transfer them with U.S. approval. The real question now is how far the United States is willing to go in its reluctance to support Ukraine,\u201d he told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of sensitivity of the subject.",
      "The official said that Patriot missiles exist in sufficient numbers globally, and he said that accessing them requires political resolve.",
      "\u201cThere are enough missiles out there,\u201d he said, without providing evidence.",
      "He also stated that Ukraine has already scaled up its domestic production of 155 mm artillery shells, which were once critically short, and is now capable of producing more than is currently contracted. \u201cSupplies from abroad have also become more available than before,\u201d he said.",
      "Amid at times fraught relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been enlisting greater European help for his country\u2019s arms manufacturing plans.",
      "European countries don\u2019t have the production levels, military stockpiles or the technology to pick up all the slack left by the U.S. pause, but Zelenskyy is recruiting their help for ambitious joint investment projects.",
      "Draft legislation to help Ukrainian defense manufacturers scale up and modernize production, including building new facilities at home and abroad, will be put to a vote in the Ukrainian parliament later this month, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced this week.",
      "Zelenskyy said last month that major investments will go to the production of drones and artillery shells.",
      "\u201cThe volume of support this year is the largest since the start of the full-scale war,\u201d he said about commitments from foreign countries.",
      "Under Trump, there have been no new announcements of U.S. military or weapons aid to Ukraine. Between March and April, the United States allocated no new help at all, according to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, which tracks such support.",
      "For the first time since June 2022, four months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, European countries have surpassed the U.S. in total military aid, totaling 72 billion euros ($85 billion) compared with 65 billion euros ($77 billion) from the U.S., the institute said last month.",
      "Without Patriot missiles, as well as the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile and shorter-range Stinger missiles that are also included in the pause, Ukrainian cities likely will take a bashing as more Russian missiles pierce air defenses.",
      "On the front line, Ukrainian troops haven\u2019t recently voiced complaints about ammunition shortages, as they have in the past. They have always said that during the war, they have never had as much ammunition to as their disposal as Russian forces.",
      "The army faces a different problem: It's desperately short-handed. It's turning to drones to compensate for its manpower shortage, and analysts say the front isn't about to collapse.",
      "Asked about the timing of the U.S. pause, the Ukrainian official emphasized the need for stable, reliable supply lines.",
      "\u201cThis is war \u2014 and in war, steady deliveries are always crucial,\u201d he said.",

      "Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July",
      "NEW YORK -- Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July: getting all the gear needed to host a pool party costs less than it has in years, according to a market research company's preliminary data.",
      "The total price to buy beach towels, a beverage cooler, bathing suits and other accountrements of summer fun averaged $858 in June, the lowest amount for the month since 2020, consumer data provider Numerator said in an analysis prepared for The Associated Press.",
      "The finding from the firm's seasonal snapshot comports with broader economic measures indicating that U.S. consumers so far have not seen major impacts from President Donald Trump's vigorous application of tariffs on foreign goods.",
      "Numerator tracks U.S. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from a panel of 200,000 shoppers. To see how prices are shaping up for the summer, the company looked at the average purchase price for 16 seasonal items typically made in China.",
      "Along with four towels, a cooler and bathing suits for two adults and a toddler, the hypothetical shopping list for a poolside gathering included a grill, four patio chairs, four cushions, a patio umbrella and four outdoor pillows. Recreation supplies included a cornhole set, two pairs of swim goggles, a set of diving rings, two beach balls and two pool floats or noodles.",
      "Leo Feler, Numerator\u2019s chief economist, offered a few theories for why buying all that stuff cost 11% less last month than it did in June 2023, when the average cost reached a high of $966, and 8.4% less than it did in June 2024.",
      "Wholesale suppliers and retailers that order from Chinese manufacturers may have imported too much stock while trying to stay ahead of high tariff bills, Feler said. As declining consumer confidence measures pointed to the possibility of weak sales, those businesses might have offered early discounts rather than risking their merchandise going unsold, he said.",
      "Given wide swings in Trump\u2019s trade posture toward China, retail vendors may have decided to absorb any initial tariff costs instead of trying to figure out how much more to charge their business customers, Feler said. The tariff rate on Chinese products soared to 145% in April before China and the U.S. reached a deal last month that brought the overall rate down to 55%.",
      "Suppliers often work on six-month contracts that are signed in January or February and again in June or July. That means many contracts for patio tables and chairs, for example, were signed before the White House included metal furniture in the aluminum or steel products that would be subject to a 25% tariff that went up to 50% last month.",
      "Customers who want to buy a new set of beach towels or to replace an old cooler still might want to hold off until August since prices will get lower in late summer, Feler said. But waiting until next year may prove costly, if the tariffs on products from China remain in place, he said.",
      "Just because preparing for a backyard bash might be comparatively less expensive right now, many economists and retail industry analysts still expect consumers to feel the weight of Trump's favorite trade negotiation tool.

      "The administration this week withheld more than $6 billion intended for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more, saying it would review the grants to ensure they align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. The freeze sent schools and summer camp providers scrambling to determine whether they can still provide programs like day camps this summer or after-hours child care this fall.",
      "On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget said an initial review showed schools used some of the money to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. The administration said it hadn't made any final decisions about whether to withhold or release individual grants.",
      "\u201cMany of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.",
      "It said New York schools had used money for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for immigrants in the country illegally. Washington state used the money to direct immigrants without legal status toward scholarships the Trump administration says were \u201cintended for American students.\u201d Grant funds also were used for a seminar on \u201cqueer resistance in the arts,\u201d the office said.",
      "Officials from New York and Washington state didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Advocates for low-income and immigrant children connected the grant freeze to the Trump administration's larger crackdown on immigrants. Two of the five federal programs put on hold were appropriated by Congress to help support English proficiency of students still learning the language and migrant children who move with their parents to follow agricultural and other jobs.",
      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages. The $375 million appropriated for migrant education is often used to hire dedicated teachers to travel close to where students live.",
      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe way they\u2019re framing it is that we\u2019re using this money for undocumented students and families,\" said Margarita Machado-Casas, president of the National Association of Bilingual Educators. \"It\u2019s a distraction. A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",
      "Meanwhile, states and school districts are still trying to understand what it will mean for their students and their staff if these funds never arrive.",
      "In Oregon, eliminating grants for English learners and migrant students would \"undermine the state\u2019s efforts to increase academic outcomes for multilingual students, promote multilingualism, close opportunity gaps and provide targeted support to mobile and vulnerable student groups,\u201d said Liz Merah, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Education.",

      "The decision appears on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage but as of Wednesday wasn\u2019t on the agency\u2019s official adult immunization schedule.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, typically is a coldlike nuisance, but it can be severe, even life-threatening, for infants and older adults. The CDC recommends vaccination for certain pregnant women and a onetime shot for everyone 75 or older. But people as young as 60 with health problems that increase their risk can also get it.",
      "In April, the CDC\u2019s influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended expanding RSV vaccination to high-risk adults as young as 50, too. But the CDC lacks a director to decide whether to adopt that recommendation and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn\u2019t immediately act.",
      "Last month, Kennedy fired all 17 members of that panel and handpicked seven replacements that include several vaccine skeptics.",
      "The new panel alarmed doctors' groups last week by ignoring settled science on a rarely used flu vaccine preservative and by announcing a probe of the children\u2019s vaccine schedule. It didn't revisit RSV vaccination for older adults.",
      "Kennedy already had taken the unusual step of changing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations without consulting the committee.",
      "On Wednesday, a page on CDC's website said that on June 25, Kennedy had adopted the ousted panel's recommendation to expand RSV vaccination to high-risk 50-somethings and it is \u201cnow an official recommendation of the CDC.\u201d",

Trump promptly suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations like the one with Vietnam. The pause expires Tuesday, but so far the Trump administration has reached a trade agreement with only one of those countries \u2014 the United Kingdom. (Trump has also reached a \"framework'' agreement with China in a separate trade dispute.)",
      "\u201cVietnam has been very keen to get out from under this,'' said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201dThis is forcing a smaller country to eat it, basically. We can do that. It's the big countries that everybody's keeping their eyes on.'' She doubts that Trump will be able to impose such a lopsided agreement on big trading partners such as the European Union and Japan.",
      "The United States last year ran a $122 billion trade deficit with Vietnam. That was the third-biggest U.S. trade gap \u2014 the difference between the goods and services it buys from other countries and those it sells them \u2014 behind the ones with China and Mexico.",
      "In addition to the 20% tariffs, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 40% tax on \"transshipping'' \u2014 goods from another country that stop in Vietnam on their way to the United States. Washington complains that Chinese goods have been dodging higher U.S. tariffs by transiting through Vietnam.",

      "Reporting in Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria was tough work for reporter Jane Ferguson",
      "NEW YORK -- Jane Ferguson has won awards for unflinching reporting from dangerous lands including Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen. So she was unlikely to be intimidated by seeking financing for a new journalism platform, despite tough times for the news industry.",
      "\u201cIt's very high pressure,\u201d said Ferguson, founder of Noosphere. \u201cI'm used to pressure in the field.\u201d",
      "Started this year, Noosphere offers journalists a place to showcase work to consumers who are attracted by a more personal style of reporting than they'd normally see on traditional outlets.",
      "It's similar to Substack, with a twist. Instead of paying for feeds of individual journalists \u2014 the Substack model \u2014 people who subscribe to Noosphere for $14.99 a month get access to all of its journalists. There are 20 so far, expected to increase to 24 with the site's upcoming British launch.",
      "Noosphere \u2014 named to reference a state of consciousness advanced by Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin \u2014 arrives at a time of flux in the news industry. Consumers are fleeing newspapers and television news and trying different approaches springing up in a new media world.",
      "Ferguson raised $1 million to get Noosphere off the ground and is about to announce an additional round of investment.",
      "Ferguson, 40, grew up in Northern Ireland, and was attracted to the high-stakes, high-risk world of international reporting. For CNN International and then PBS NewsHour, she worked largely alone, covering stories about famine and war crimes in South Sudan, the conflict in Syria and Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021.",
      "The latter experience left her shell-shocked and heartbroken, wondering if she'd reached the end of that phase of her career. \u201cI had been on the road for 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201cI was exhausted, and in some respects, burnt out.\u201d",
      "She settled in the United States, teaching \u2014 and learning \u2014 at Princeton. She took classes in entrepreneurship and built contacts in the business world. Ferguson knew how many of her former international colleagues had to hustle to find outlets for their work, and envisioned Noosphere as a landing spot. Her business partner, Seb Walker, worked at Vice Media, known for its strong international reporting before filing for bankruptcy in 2023.",
      "\u201cIt's gotten a lot harder to continue making a living doing this,\u201d said Matthew Cassell, an international correspondent whose credits include Vice. A member of Noosphere's inaugural class of journalists, Cassell has posted videos giving his perspectives on the Israel-Iran war, along with recent reporting from the West Bank.",
      "Shrouq Al Aila contributed video from Gaza, showing efforts to distribute aid as the sound of gunfire is heard in the background. Oren Ziv reported from a missile strike in Israel, walking through a hospital's shattered hallways to show the destruction.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a really high-quality reporter is Face-Timing you from the field,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cwhich is really cool.\u201d",
      "News consumers, particularly young ones, are souring on more stilted, conventional television news reporting, said veteran journalist Kate O'Brian, who is on Noosphere's board of directors. \u201cThe stage has been set for an audience who wants to hear directly from the journalist,\u201d O'Brian said.",
      "Ferguson envisions a reporting staff that is roughly half international, half based in the United States. Former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza reports on Washington for Noosphere.",
      "Her biggest signing to date is former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd. He started a Sunday night show in June, with \u201cWar Room\u201d host Steve Bannon and Trita Parsi, founder of the National Iranian American Council, as his first guests. Todd has hired the former producer for Charlie Rose's PBS talk show, a clue to his ambitions for an eclectic show interviewing interesting people from politics and business.",
      "\u201cJane's hard to say no to,\u201d Todd said. \u201cLike any smart executive, she knows what she doesn't know, and goes to find smart people who she thinks know more.\"",
      "Ferguson's bet is that audiences can only afford so many Substack subscriptions to individual journalists, and that Noosphere will offer access to more at a set price. She's also talked to news outlets interested in acquiring some of the reporters' work.",
      "The challenge to getting Noosphere established is an increasingly crowded marketplace, and several of her journalists aren't household names.",
      "Noosphere journalists are paid a percentage of subscription fees, and given a greater amount if a subscriber specifically cites that contributor's work in signing on. Ferguson will not say how many subscribers she has yet.",
      "\u201cSubstack created a market that did not exist before and I give them huge kudos for that,\u201d O'Brian said. \u201cThis is just a different way of approaching it.\u201d",
      "To succeed, \u201cyou have to offer a lot,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou can't just offer one or two things. Every hot spot around the world, Noosphere will have journalists on the ground. They have a reasonable chance to be very successful in their lane. The question is how big the lane can get.\u201d",
      "Todd said Noosphere's advantage is that it has been created by reporters, a distinction from the lack of journalism experience found among executives in the business, he said.",
      "Ferguson, too, has wondered whether journalism can survive the diminishment or death of news organizations. \u201cThe solution for the problems of the industry are going to come from journalists and not media executives,\u201d she said.",

      "The tour said Fiori had been battling cancer. It provided no other details.",
      "A four-time winner on the PGA Tour, no victory was more memorable than the 1996 Quad City Classic, now the John Deere Classic. Three tournaments into his pro career, a 20-year-old Woods had a one-shot lead over Fiori going into the final round at Oakwood Country Club.",
      "Woods had a quadruple bogey on the fourth hole and a four-putt double bogey on the seventh hole. He shot 72 to tie for fifth, four shots behind Fiori. Woods won two starts later in Las Vegas. He never lost a 54-hole lead in another PGA Tour-sanctioned event until Y.E. Yang beat him in the 2009 PGA Championship at Hazeltine.",
      "Lee Westwood overcame a deficit to beat Woods in 2000 in a European tour event in Germany.",
      "Fiori also beat two other Hall of Fame members in playoffs, Tom Weiskopf in the 1979 Southern Open and Tom Kite in the 1982 Bob Hope Classic.",
      "\u201cIn three of his four wins on the PGA Tour, he dueled down the stretch with future World Golf Hall of Fame members, most notably Tiger Woods in 1996. That grit and resolution in the face of immeasurable odds is incredibly admirable in every aspect of life, and I know he battled cancer with that same determination until the end,\u201d said Miller Brady, president of the PGA Tour Champions. \u201cHe will be missed by all of us at the tour.\u201d",
      "Fiori played only 58 times on the senior circuit after turn 50, winning in 2004 in Mexico.",
      "\u201cI hung on for a few more years, and played for a while on the senior tour, but my back was always a problem,\u201d Fiori said in a 2019 interview with Golf.com \"I had spinal fusion surgery in 2005, and from then on, I struggled to break 80.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me, though. I\u2019ve had a great life in a game I love. It was never easy. Lots of times, I was on that flight heading home on Friday nights,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would not trade it for anything. Even today, people call me the Tiger killer. They don\u2019t always get their facts straight, but I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll never forget that weekend at the John Deere.\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- Randy Arozarena homered, George Kirby tossed 6 1/3 crisp innings and the Seattle Mariners shut out the punchless Pirates for the third straight game, winning 1-0 on Sunday as Pittsburgh wasted another strong start by All-Star Paul Skenes.",
      "Arozarena hit his 14th longball of the season and sixth in seven games when he turned on a low fastball in the sixth inning from reliever Carmen Mlodzinski (2-6).",
      "Skenes had a short but effective outing, striking out 10 and allowing five hits in five innings. He threw 52 of his 78 pitches for strikes and lowered his ERA to 1.94 but is just 4-7 this season.",
      "Pittsburgh was beaten 6-0 on Friday and 1-0 on Saturday during its scoreless weekend in Seattle. Before making the trip, the Pirates blanked St. Louis three straight times at home. The streak of playing in six straight shutouts is tied for the longest in major league history.",
      "Kirby (3-4) struck out nine, allowed four singles and walked none.",
      "Andres Mu\u00f1oz, named an AL All-Star on Sunday, worked the ninth for his 21st save, which is one shy of his career high.",
      "The Mariners came close to taking a 1-0 lead in the first on a single by Jorge Polanco, but Pirates center fielder Oneil Cruz made a 105.2 mph throw to nab Seattle\u2019s J.P. Crawford at the plate. It was the second-hardest thrown ball to produce an outfield assist since Statcast started tracking in 2015.",
      "Polanco's hit was the 1,000th of his career.",
      "Pirates: Left-hander Andrew Heaney (4-7, 4.16 ERA) starts Monday night at Kansas City.",

      "It's win or bust for Brian Campbell on the PGA Tour",
      "SILVIS, Ill. -- Brian Campbell won for the second time this year on the PGA Tour, both in a playoff, when he closed with a 4-under 67 and beat Emiliano Grillo with a par on the first extra hole Sunday in the John Deere Classic.",
      "It extended the win-or-bust season for Campbell, who won the Mexico Open in a playoff in late February. He has finished out of the top 30 every tournament except for his two victories.",
      "This one might be enough to get him into the British Open, depending on how high up he moves in the world ranking published Monday, traditionally used as the alternate list.",
      "Campbell appeared to have control of the tournament with three birdies in a four-hole stretch to start the back nine. But he fell back with a double bogey into the trees on the 15th, and it was a wild scramble to the finish.",
      "Grillo, who also closed with a 67, took the lead when Campbell made double bogey, only to three-putt for bogey on the 16th.",
      "Campbell, one of the shorter hitters on tour, blasted a 3-wood to 18 feet for a two-putt birdie on the par-5 17th and narrowly missed a 25-foot birdie on the 18th. He was the first player to post at 18-under 266.",
      "Grillo got up-and-down for birdie on the 17th, holing an 8-foot putt, and caught a bad break on the 18th when his drive settled into a divot. He hit wedge to just inside 40 feet and two-putted for par to join Campbell at 266.",
      "David Lipsky was poised to join them when he hit a punch 3-wood to 8 feet for eagle on the 17th to tie for the lead. But he hooked his drive on the 18th, couldn't reach the green, and his 15-foot par putt to get into the playoff caught the left lip and spun away. He shot 68 and tied for third with Kevin Roy (65).",
      "The playoff lacked any real drama. Campbell hit a beautiful trap draw to about 15 feet on the 18th. Grillo, who caught a break when his drive to the right was sitting up in trampled rough, sent long over the green. His flop shot didn't quite reach the putting surface, and his par attempt from some 25 feet never had a chance.",
      "\u201cI got myself there. I gave myself a chance,\u201d Grillo said. \u201cI made some good putts. Hit a good putt on the 72nd and that\u2019s all I can do.\u201d",
      "Campbell becomes the fifth player this year to have multiple victories in individual tournaments on the PGA Tour, joining Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Sepp Straka and Ryan Fox.",
      "He finished about a half-hour ahead of the final group, but Campbell chose to stay in the clubhouse to see if his score would hold up instead of staying loose on the practice range. He said it was hot enough that it was better to cool off and get some rest, and there was no arguing with the result \u2014 he drilled his drive down the middle and put all the pressure on Grillo with his approach to the green.",
      "Max Homa, winless in more than two years, ran off three straight birdies early in the round to briefly take the lead. He played the last 14 holes in 1 over, missing key putts to stay in the game, and wound up with a 69 to tie for fifth. It was his first top 10 on the PGA Tour in nearly 15 months.",
      "Five others tied for fifth, including 47-year-old Matt Kuchar, who closed with a 66, and Lucas Glover, who shot a 64.",

    "story": [
      "Manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo have been fired by the Washington Nationals amid their sixth consecutive losing season since they won the 2019 World Series",
      "WASHINGTON -- Manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo were fired by the Washington Nationals on Sunday in moves that were surprising for their timing, even if the club is more than halfway through its sixth consecutive losing season since winning the 2019 World Series.",
      "The team announced the changes just hours after Washington's 6-4 loss at home completed a sweep by the Boston Red Sox. The Nationals are 37-53 and last in the NL East; the only National League club with a worse record is the Colorado Rockies.",
      "But the amateur draft is just a week away, and Washington has the No. 1 overall pick.",
      "Senior VP and assistant GM Mike DeBartolo is taking over for Rizzo on an interim basis. A replacement for Martinez wasn't named immediately.",
      "Washington could have exercised options to extend the contracts of both Martinez and Rizzo beyond this season.",
      "\u201cWhile we are appreciative of their past successes,\" Nationals owner Mark Lerner said in a statement issued by the team, \"the on-field performance has not been where we or our fans expect it to be. This is a pivotal time for our club, and we believe a fresh approach and new energy is the best course of action for our team moving forward.\u201d",
      "Rizzo\u2019s time running the Nationals is over after more than a decade and a half. One of the Lerner family's first hires when it assumed control of the organization, Rizzo had been GM since 2009 and added the title of president of baseball operations in 2013.",
      "\u201cHe played an instrumental role in leading the transformation of our farm system and building a roster that reached an unprecedented level of organizational success,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cMike helped make us who we are as an organization, and we\u2019re so thankful to him for his hard work and dedication.\u201d",
      "Martinez is the fourth manager fired since the start of this season \u2014 after Pittsburgh\u2019s Derek Shelton, Colorado\u2019s Bud Black and Baltimore\u2019s Brandon Hyde.",
      "Martinez\u2019s full record with the Nationals was 500-622. Last month, he bristled at a reporter's question about how to split the blame for poor performance among players and his staff.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never on coaching,\u201d Martinez said then. \u201cNever on coaching. Coaches work their (butts) off every single day. We\u2019re not going to finger point here and say it\u2019s coaches. It\u2019s never on the coaches. They work hard. The message is clear. All the work is done prior. So, sometimes, they have to go out there and play the game. It\u2019s always been about the players. Always.\u201d",
      "Martinez had never been a manager at any level when Rizzo hired him to replace Dusty Baker before the 2018 season. The Nationals went 82-80 in Martinez\u2019s first season and got off to a 19-31 start the following year, leading to some calls for him to be replaced.",
      "But Rizzo stuck with Martinez, and that decision paid off in a big way: Led by starting pitchers Stephen Strasburg, who earned World Series MVP honors, and Max Scherzer, rookie outfielder Juan Soto, young shortstop Trea Turner and a string of veterans \u2014 including Howie Kendrick, Ryan Zimmerman and Anthony Rendon \u2014 the Nationals won the franchise\u2019s first title.",
      "No one from the World Series roster is still playing for the franchise.",
      "Washington took a step back in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, and then Rizzo began tearing apart the roster, making a series of trades that sent Scherzer, Soto, Turner and others elsewhere.",
      "The reconstruction has continued, without much in the way of concrete progress in the standings to show for it, although the team does have some building blocks that show promise, including starter MacKenzie Gore and outfielder James Wood \u2014 both named NL All-Stars on Sunday \u2014 along with shortstop CJ Abrams, who was an All-Star a year ago.",
      "\u201cNationals fans have a lot to be optimistic about, and we see these changes as a difficult, but necessary move in a positive direction,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cAs has been the case since my late father took control of the team almost 20 years ago, our family remains committed to winning.\"",
      "Washington finished fourth or fifth in the NL East every year from 2020 through 2024, never putting together a higher winning percentage than the .438 (71-91) each of the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always appreciated and admired Davey\u2019s passion for the game of baseball and the love he has for his players,\" Lerner said. \"Davey\u2019s ability to connect with our staff, our players, our fans and our community set him apart. While this chapter has come to an end, we know that it doesn\u2019t close the book on what should continue to be a long and successful career in baseball.\u201d",

      "Kershaw gives the Dodgers at least five All-Stars for the sixth straight season. The oldest NL All-Star at 37 and most senior All-Star with 11 selections, Kershaw is joined by Yamamoto and fan-elected starters Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith.",

Smith was left unprotected by Milwaukee and joined Wilson (Athletics) as the only rookies on the All-Star rosters.",
      "Skenes, Washington's MacKenzie Gore, Atlanta's Chris Sale, San Francisco's Logan Webb and Philadelphia's Zack Wheeler were elected to the starting rotation by players along with relievers Jason Adam of San Diego, Edwin D\u00edaz of the New York Mets and Randy Rodr\u00edguez of San Francisco.",

      "It was a familiar scene.",
      "Van Gisbergen completed a Windy City sweep Sunday, winning the NASCAR Cup Series race on the tricky street course in downtown Chicago.",
      "\u201cEpic weekend for us. I\u2019m a lucky guy,\u201d van Gisbergen said.",
      "A talented one, too.",
      "The 36-year-old New Zealand native became the second driver to sweep the Xfinity and Cup races in a single weekend from the pole, joining Kyle Busch at Indianapolis in 2016. With his third career Cup win, he also became the winningest foreign-born driver on NASCAR's top series.",
      "It was van Gisbergen's second victory of the season after the Trackhouse Racing driver also won last month on a Mexico City road course.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the best road course stock car racer that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trackhouse owner Justin Marks said. \u201cI think when he\u2019s done with us all and walks away from the sport, I think he\u2019s going to walk away as the best road course racer that this sport has ever seen.\u201d",
      "Marks brought van Gisbergen over from Australia\u2019s Supercars for the first edition of NASCAR\u2019s Chicago experiment in 2023, and he became the first driver to win his Cup debut since Johnny Rutherford in the second qualifying race at Daytona in 1963.",
      "He also won Chicago\u2019s Xfinity Series stop last year and the first stage in the Cup race before he was knocked out by a crash.",
      "\u201cThis joint, it\u2019s changed my life,\u201d van Gisbergen said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any plans to do more NASCAR races when I first came over here, and I never thought I\u2019d be in NASCAR full time.\u201d",
      "In what might be the last NASCAR race on the downtown Chicago circuit, Ty Gibbs was second and Tyler Reddick finished third. Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch rounded out the top five.",
      "\u201cMy team called a great strategy and got me in position to get me up front to compete for the win,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cIt worked out for us today, so I\u2019m glad to have a good finish, but we wish we could have gone for the win.\u201d",
      "Michael McDowell joined van Gisbergen on the front row and quickly moved in front. He won Stage 1 and led for 31 laps before he was derailed by a throttle cable issue.",
      "Van Gisbergen regained the lead when he passed Chase Briscoe with 16 laps left. As fog and rain moved into downtown Chicago, van Gisbergen controlled the action the rest of the way.",
      "AJ Allmendinger was sixth, and Ryan Preece finished seventh. Ryan Blaney, who won the second stage, was 12th.",
      "\u201cI thought overall it was a pretty decent day. It was nice to win that stage,\" Blaney said.",
      "William Byron's day was cut short by a clutch problem. The Hendrick Motorsports driver leads the point standings by 13 points over Chase Elliott.",
      "After McDowell seized the lead early in the race, Carson Hocevar caused a multicar crash when he hit the wall and spun out between Turns 10 and 11. Brad Keselowski, Austin Dillon, Daniel Su\u00e1rez and Will Brown were among the drivers collected in the wreck.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see it until the last second,\" Keselowski said. \"I slowed down and I actually felt I was going to get stopped and then I just kind of got ran over from behind. It\u2019s just a narrow street course and sometimes there\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d",
      "Ty Dillon and Reddick moved into the third round of NASCAR's inaugural in-season tournament when Keselowski and Hocevar were unable to finish the race. Dillon, the No. 32 seed, eliminated Keselowski after he upset top-seeded Denny Hamlin last weekend at Atlanta.",
      "Gibbs, Preece, Alex Bowman, John H. Nemechek, Zane Smith and Erik Jones also advanced. The winner of the five-race, bracket-style tournament takes home a $1 million prize.",
      "Bowman, the 2024 champion on the downtown street course, won his head-to-head matchup with Bubba Wallace. Bowman and Wallace made contact as they battled for position late in the race after they also tangled in Chicago last year.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that to happen or to get raced like that, but we did,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cWe just have to move on from it and keep digging. I don\u2019t really know what I could have done much different.\u201d",

      "Turpin was arrested by police in Allen on Saturday. The 28-year-old is out of jail on bond. There is no record of an attorney for Turpin. The team declined to comment.",
      "The former TCU standout is going into his fourth season with the Cowboys and recently signed an $18 million, three-year contract.",
      "Turpin's TCU career ended in 2018 when he was kicked off the team after the school found out about a second domestic violence case against him. The case from New Mexico was discovered following an alleged incident with his girlfriend at an off-campus apartment in Fort Worth. Both cases involved the same woman.",
      "The Cowboys signed Turpin out of the USFL in 2022. He had played in several satellite football leagues before joining the USFL.",
      "Turpin secured his spot on the team by returning a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns in a 2022 preseason game.

      "Kevin Durant\u2019s trade to the Houston Rockets is official and officially record-setting.",
      "The deal got approved by the NBA on Sunday as part of a seven-team transaction, one in which a slew of other trade agreements got folded into one massive package.",
      "\u201cKevin impacts the game on both ends of the court and is one of the most efficient scorers in the history of basketball,\u201d Rockets general manager Rafael Stone said. \u201cWe liked the growth our team showed last season and believe Kevin\u2019s skill set will integrate seamlessly.\u201d",
      "Involved in the deal: Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, Minnesota, Golden State, Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Lakers. It includes a total of 13 players \u2014 the headline moves include Durant going to Houston from Phoenix, the Rockets sending Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks to the Suns, and the Rockets acquiring Clint Capela from the Hawks.",
      "The seven-team involvement in the Durant trade tops the previous record, a six-team transaction last summer that most notably sent Klay Thompson to the Dallas Mavericks. Golden State \u2014 Thompson\u2019s former team \u2014 obviously was another part of that trade, as were Charlotte, Minnesota, Philadelphia and Denver on varying levels.",
      "\u201cOne of the greatest to ever play the game, we are grateful for the impact Kevin made on our organization and in our community,\u201d Phoenix general manager Brian Gregory said of Durant. \u201cAs a member of the Suns, he climbed the scoring charts to become just the eighth player in NBA history to score 30,000 career points, and we wish him the best as he continues his career in Houston.\u201d",
      "There will be at least five second-round draft picks in the deal before all terms are satisfied, the potential for another second-round pick swap and the Hawks and Timberwolves both had to receive some cash considerations to make all the math work. And some of those draft picks won\u2019t actually be made until 2032, which raises the serious possibility that some players who will go down in history as being part of the trade haven\u2019t reached high school yet.",
      "Durant averaged 26.6 points last season, his 17th in the NBA \u2014 not counting one year missed because of injury. For his career, the 6-foot-11 forward is averaging 27.2 points and seven rebounds per game.",
      "The move brings Durant back to the state of Texas, where he played his only year of college basketball for the Longhorns and was the college player of the year before going as the No. 2 pick in the 2007 draft by Seattle.",
      "Houston becomes his fifth franchise, joining the SuperSonics (who then became the Oklahoma City Thunder), Golden State, Brooklyn and Phoenix. Durant won his two titles with the Warriors in 2017 and 2018, and last summer in Paris he became the highest-scoring player in U.S. Olympic basketball history and the first men\u2019s player to be part of four gold-medal teams.",
      "Durant is a four-time scoring champion, a two-time Finals MVP and one of eight players in NBA history with more than 30,000 career points.",
      "\u201cHaving played against Kevin and coached him before, I know he\u2019s the type of competitor who fits with what we\u2019ve been building here in Houston,\u201d Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. \u201cHis skill level, love of basketball, and dedication to his craft have made him one of the most respected players of his generation, and my staff and I are excited to work with him.\u201d",
      "Houston sent Green and Brooks to Phoenix, along with the rights to Khaman Maluach from last month's draft, a second-round pick in 2026 and another second-rounder in 2032. The Hawks got David Roddy, cash and a 2031 second-round pick swap from the Rockets. Brooklyn gets a 2026 second-round pick and another in 2030 from the Rockets, and the Warriors received the rights to Jahmai Mashack from last month's draft.",

      "Wimbledon is planning a major expansion that includes an 8,000-seat stadium and 38 other grass courts near its current grounds",
      "LONDON -- Novak Djokovic calls it a \u201cwin-win.\u201d Carlos Alcaraz says it\u2019s a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d",
      "Wimbledon\u2019s major expansion plan includes adding an 8,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof and 38 other grass courts at a former golf course across the street that would allow the All England Club to move its qualifying event and hold it on-site \u2014 as the other Grand Slam tournaments do \u2014 to boost attendance and revenue.",
      "Some local residents did a deep dive on the details, though, and they\u2019re not as convinced as the major champions are. That is why the proposal goes to the U.K.\u2019s High Court for a judicial review Tuesday and Wednesday as the quarterfinals are held at the tournament that concludes next weekend.",
      "Opponents say they love tennis as much as the 500,000 or so fans who flock to SW19 \u2014 Wimbledon\u2019s well-known post code \u2014 over the course of the two-week event.",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019re also lovers of the environment and of trees and greenery and open spaces,\u201d said Susan Cusack, a member of Save Wimbledon Park.",
      "That's the group challenging the Greater London Authority\u2019s approval last September of Wimbledon\u2019s project, and they say they have raised more than $270,000 to pay for lawyers to fight against what Cusack and others call an \u201cindustrial tennis complex.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a massive developer. On their current site, all they do is build, build, build,\u201d Cusack said.",
      "Aside from concerns about the environment and overall scale, opponents argue the adjacent property that was a golf course when the All England Club bought it in 2018 is subject to restrictions that favor preservation of open space for the public.",
      "The oldest Grand Slam tournament is the only one of the four that holds its qualifying rounds at a completely separate location. There are also too few practice courts in the current setup, requiring some of the world\u2019s best players to share courts.",
      "\u201cWimbledon needs to stay at the pinnacle of world sport, and to do that, you have to evolve both on the court but also off the court with the infrastructure,\u201d Debbie Jevans, chair of the All England Club, told The Associated Press.",
      "Wimbledon\u2019s attendance numbers trail the other three majors. The Australian Open sold 1.1 million tickets for this year\u2019s main draw \u2014 more than double Wimbledon\u2019s 2024 tally \u2014 after bringing in more than 115,000 the week of qualifying. Wimbledon\u2019s qualifying, three miles away at Roehampton, has 8,000 tickets total.",
      "The French Open pulled in 80,000 fans for its qualifying. Fans could watch star players practice, in addition to the mini-tournament in which competitors play for coveted spots in the singles brackets.",
      "Wimbledon\u2019s project would allow 8,000 spectators at qualifying \u2014 per day.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the other Grand Slams, they will have community events during that first week ... and, of course, the serious tennis,\u201d Jevans said. \u201cSo we always start with the tennis but, yes, I want the opportunity to embrace more people. The demand for our tickets is off the charts.\u201d",
      "An 8,000-seat arena would become Wimbledon's third-largest stadium after Centre Court and No. 1 Court; it would be located just across the street from No. 1 Court.",
      "Wimbledon's plan, which incorporates space now used for the famous Queue, would more than double its total number of grass courts \u2014 there are currently 18 for the tournament, plus 20 for practice.",
      "Jevans said \u201cat least seven\u201d of the proposed new courts would be made available for community use. The plan also includes two public parks, one that would be 23 acres.",
      "The club declined comment on the project's price tag, which British media has reported will be about $270 million.",
      "If the plan survives legal challenges, there's still an eight-year construction window. That should rule out the 38-year-old Djokovic's chances of competing on the new courts. But the seven-time Wimbledon champion still wants the plan to succeed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great for the community, for London, for our sport. It\u2019s a win-win, to be honest. If it doesn\u2019t go through, it will be a shame,\u201d he said Thursday.",
      "Belinda Bencic, who was 17 when she made her Wimbledon debut in 2014, said Saturday she likes that the club \u201cis investing and trying to do the best for the players.\"",
      "Two-time defending champion Alcaraz said putting \u201cqualifying really close (to) where we are now \u2014 I think it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d",
      "Whatever happens, Djokovic noted, Wimbledon's future is secure.",
      "\u201cWimbledon, as it is already, is a sacred tournament, a tournament that everybody wants to win or play in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is only a bonus. It\u2019s something that will get it to even a higher level of recognition.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- A ball that clearly landed long in a match at Centre Court wasn't called out Sunday because the electronic system that replaced line judges at Wimbledon this year was shut off.",
      "And, because the replay review procedure that used to be in place also has been scrapped, the chair umpire decided to have a do-over on the point at 4-all in the first set \u2014 much to the dismay of Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the player who would have won the game if the proper call had been made originally.",
      "Pavlyuchenkova wound up getting broken there to trail Sonay Kartal, but she eventually did manage to come back to win the match 7-6 (3), 6-4 and reach the quarterfinals at the All England Club for the first time since 2016.",
      "\u201cYou took the game away from me,\u201d 2021 French Open runner-up Pavlyuchenkova told chair umpire Nico Helwerth at the changeover after the game ended.",
      "She was serving and had a game point when Kartal hit a backhand that landed beyond the opposite baseline \u2014 clearly out, TV replays showed. But there was no sound of one of the recorded voices being used for the first time at Wimbledon to reflect when the technology being used in place of human officials determines that a ball landed out.",
      "Kartal said she couldn't see where her shot went.",
      "\u201cThat situation is a rarity. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really ever happened \u2014 if it has. It\u2019s tough. What can you do? The umpire\u2019s trying his best in that situation, and he handled it fine,\u201d Kartal said. \u201cI think the system just malfunctioned a little bit, and the fairest way was what he did: replay the point.\u201d",
      "Helwerth delayed play while he made a phone call from his stand. Eventually, play resumed, Pavlyuchenkova missed a forehand on the replay, then lost the game a few points later.",
      "The explanation offered by an All England Club spokesman: \u201cDue to operator error, the system was deactivated on the point in question. The chair umpire followed the established process.\u201d",
      "The French Open is now the only Grand Slam tournament that still uses line judges instead of electronic calls.",
      "From 2007 through last year, players were allowed to challenge in-or-out calls at Wimbledon; a video review was employed to decide whether a line judge's \u2014 or chair umpire's \u2014 ruling was correct. That challenge system was removed for the current tournament, but there immediately were demands on social media from some tennis fans or observers to bring that back to aid chair umpires.",
      "Taylor Fritz, who reached the quarterfinals with a win at a different court Sunday, didn't see what happened. But when it was explained by a reporter, his biggest question was why the chair umpire didn't just make the call himself if it was so clear what actually happened on Kartal's shot.",
      "\u201cThe chair umpire has to make the call,\u201d 2024 U.S. Open finalist Fritz said. \u201cWhy is he there if he\u2019s not going to call the ball?\u201d",

      "The quarterfinals will be set after Monday's play, which leads off at Centre Court with 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic against No. 11 Alex de Minaur at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET). They were supposed to face each other in last year's quarterfinals at Wimbledon, but de Minaur was forced to withdraw before the match with a hip injury. That's to be followed by No. 7 Mirra Andreeva vs. No. 10 Emma Navarro, who eliminated 2024 champion Barbora Krejcikova in the third round, and then No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. No. 19 Grigor Dimitrov.

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Ben Shelton launched a public plea for his sister to get some extra time off from her job at investment bank Morgan Stanley so she could remain at Wimbledon to cheer for him. It worked.",
      "After advancing to face Italy's Lorenzo Sonego on Monday in the fourth round, Shelton spoke in an on-court interview in front of a crowd that included his sister, Emma, and his girlfriend, U.S. national soccer team star Trinity Rodman.",
      "\u201cI've been playing well this week. It's not just been me here. I have a great team. My parents are here. My grildfriend's here. Also, my sister's here. She's been here for every match that I've played this tournament so far. She's been the lucky charm,\u201d said the 10th-seeded Shelton, a 22-year-old American who has appeared in two Grand Slam semifinals. \u201cBut she has work back in the U.S., starting on Monday.

    "story": [
      "A stark disagreement over regulating AI in Republicans\u2019 tax cut and spending bill is the latest tension among conservatives about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference",
      "NEW YORK -- A controversial bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as the Republican tax cut and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump worked its way through the U.S. Senate.",
      "But as the bill neared a final vote, a relentless campaign against it by a constellation of conservatives \u2014 including Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups \u2014 had been eroding support. One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",
      "Eric Lucero, a Republican state lawmaker in Minnesota, noted that many other industries already navigate different regulations established by both state and local jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI think everyone in the conservative movement agrees we need to beat China,\" said Daniel Cochrane from the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI just think we have different prescriptions for doing so.\u201d",
      "Many argued that in the absence of federal legislation, states were best positioned to protect citizens from the potential harms of AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X.",
      "Another Republican, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, wrote to Cruz and his counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn, urging them to remove the moratorium.",
      "She and other conservatives said some sort of federal standard could help clarify the landscape around AI and resolve some of the party's disagreements.",
      "But with the moratorium dead and Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a set of standards to guide the development of the burgeoning technology.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, Paxton said she wants to see limited federal AI legislation \u201cthat sets some clear guardrails\u201d around national security and interstate commerce, while leaving states free to address issues that affect their residents.",
      "\"When it comes to technology as powerful and potentially dangerous as AI, we should be cautious about silencing state-level efforts to protect consumers and children,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A startup called Gigablue claims to have reached a milestone by selling 200,000 carbon credits for its ocean-based carbon capture technology",
      "The startup Gigablue announced with fanfare this year that it reached a historic milestone: selling 200,000 carbon credits to fund what it describes as a groundbreaking technology in the fight against climate change.",
      "Formed three years ago by a group of entrepreneurs in Israel, the company says it has designed particles that when released in the ocean will trap carbon at the bottom of the sea. By \u201charnessing the power of nature,\u201d Gigablue says, its work will do nothing less than save the planet.",
      "But outside scientists frustrated by the lack of information released by the company say serious questions remain about whether Gigablue\u2019s technology works as the company describes. Their questions showcase tensions in an industry built on little regulation and big promises \u2014 and a tantalizing chance to profit.",
      "Jimmy Pallas, an event organizer based in Italy, struck a deal with Gigablue last year. He said he trusts the company does what it has promised him \u2014 ensuring the transportation, meals, and electricity of a recent 1,000-person event will be offset by particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s service is like \u201can extra trash can\u201d where Pallas can discard his unwanted emissions, he said.",
      "\u201cSame way I use my trash can \u2014 I don\u2019t follow where the truck that comes and picks up my trash brings it to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take their word for it.\u201d",
      "Gigablue has a grand vision for the future of carbon removal. It was originally named \u201cGigaton\u201d after the one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide most scientists say will be necessary to remove from the atmosphere each year to slow global warming.",
      "The company began trials in the South Pacific Ocean last year, and says it will work with country authorities to create a \u201csequestration field\u201d \u2014 a dedicated part of the ocean where \u201cpulses\u201d of particles will be released on a seasonal basis.",
      "Gigablue says its solution is affordable, too \u2014 priced to attract investors.",
      "\u201cEvery time we go to the ocean, we generate hundreds of thousands of carbon credits, and this is what we\u2019re going to do continuously over the upcoming years and towards the future, in greater and greater quantities,\u201d co-founder Ori Shaashua said.",
      "Carbon credits, which have grown in popularity over the last decade, are tokens that symbolize the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On paper, companies that buy credits achieve a smaller carbon footprint without needing to reduce their own emissions \u2014 for instance, by paying another vendor to plant trees or capture carbon dioxide from the air.",
      "Only a few countries have required local industries to purchase carbon credits. Most companies that buy them, including Microsoft and Google, do so voluntarily.",
      "The credits have helped fund a band of startups like Gigablue that are eager to tackle the climate crisis, but they are also unevenly regulated, scientifically complex, and have in some cases been linked to fraud.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s 200,000 credits are pledged to SkiesFifty, a newly formed company investing in greener practices for the aviation industry. It\u2019s the largest sale to date for a climate startup operating in the ocean, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi, making up more than half of all ocean-based carbon credits sold last year.",
      "And it could beckon a rapid acceleration of the company\u2019s work. Gigablue hopes to reach a goal this year of capturing 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of particles it deploys, Shaashua said. At that rate, Gigablue would disperse at least 20,000 tons of particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue wouldn\u2019t reveal what it earned in the sale, and SkiesFifty\u2019s team declined to be interviewed for this story. Most credits are sold for a few hundred dollars each \u2014 but a chart on Gigablue\u2019s website suggests its prices are lower than almost any other form of carbon capture on the market.",
      "The startup is the brainchild of four entrepreneurs hailing from the tech industry. According to their LinkedIn profiles, Gigablue\u2019s CEO previously worked for an online grocery startup, while its COO was vice president of SeeTree, a company that raised $60 million to provide farmers with information on their trees.",
      "Shaashua, who often serves as the face of Gigablue, said he specializes in using artificial intelligence to pursue positive outcomes in the world. He co-founded a data mining company that tracked exposure risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and led an auto startup that brokered data on car mileage and traffic patterns.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, I decided to take the same formula, so to say, to climate,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Under his guidance, he said, Gigablue created an AI-driven \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the ocean based on dozens of metrics to determine where to release the particles.",
      "Chief technology officer Sapir Markus-Alford earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in earth and environmental sciences from Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University in 2021, shortly before founding Gigablue.",
      "Markus-Alford said she began her studies and eventual path to Gigablue after seeing bleached coral reefs and other impacts of warming waters on a series of diving trips around the world.",
      "\u201cI understood that the best thing we could do for the ocean is to be able to remove CO2,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "A spokesperson for Gigablue did not answer whether the other co-founders have graduate degrees in oceanography or environmental science, but said the company\u2019s broader team holds a total of 46 Ph.D.s with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, and environmental science. Markus-Alford said that figure includes outside experts and academics and \u201ceveryone that supports us.\u201d",
      "The company\u2019s staffing has expanded from Israel to hubs in New York and New Zealand, Shaashua said.",
      "In social media posts advertising open jobs, Gigablue employees encouraged applicants to \u201cJoin Our Mission to Save the World!\u201d",
      "The particles Gigablue has patented are meant to capture carbon in the ocean by floating for a number of days and growing algae, before sinking rapidly to the ocean floor.",
      "\u201cWe are an elevator for carbon,\u201d Shaashua said. \u201cWe are exporting the carbon from the top to the bottom.\u201d",
      "Algae \u2014 sometimes referred to as phytoplankton \u2014 has long been attractive to climate scientists because it absorbs carbon dioxide from the surrounding water as it grows. If the algae sinks to the deep sea or ocean floor, Gigablue expects the carbon to be trapped there for hundreds to thousands of years.",
      "The ultimate goal is to lower carbon dioxide levels so drastically that the ocean rebalances with the atmosphere by soaking up more CO2 from the air. It\u2019s a feat that would help slow climate change, but one that is still under active study by climate scientists.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s founders have said the company\u2019s work is inspired by nature and \u201cvery, very environmentally safe.\u201d The company\u2019s particles and sinking methods simply recreate what nature has been doing \u201csince forever,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Gigablue ran its first trial sinking particles in the Mediterranean in March last year.",
      "Later, on two voyages to the South Pacific, the company released 60 cubic meters \u2014 about two shipping containers \u2014 of particles off the coast of New Zealand.",
      "While Gigablue has made several commercial deals, it has not yet revealed what its particles are made of. Partly this is because the company says it will build different particles tailored to different seasons and areas of the ocean.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s proprietary,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "Documents provide a window into the possible ingredients. According to information on the permit, Gigablue\u2019s first New Zealand trial last year involved releasing particles of pure vermiculite, a porous clay often used in potting soil.",
      "In the second New Zealand trial, the company released particles made of vermiculite, ground rock, a plant-based wax, as well as manganese and iron.",
      "A patent published last year hints the particles could also be made of scores of other materials, including cotton, rice husks or jute, as well as synthetic ingredients like polyester fibers or lint. The particles contain a range of possible binding agents, and up to 18 different chemicals and metals, from iron to nickel to vanadium.",
      "Without specifying future designs, Markus-Alford said Gigablue\u2019s particles meet certain requirements: \u201cAll the materials we use are materials that are natural, nontoxic, nonhazardous, and can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said. She wouldn\u2019t comment on the possible use of cotton or rice, but said the particles won\u2019t include any kind of plastic.",
      "When asked about vermiculite, which is typically mined on land and heated to expand, Markus-Alford said rivers and erosion transport most materials including vermiculite to the ocean. \u201cAlmost everything, basically, that exists on land can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said.",
      "The company said it had commissioned an environmental institute to verify that the particles are safe for thousands of organisms, including mussels and oysters. Any materials in future particles, Gigablue said, will be approved by local authorities.",
      "Shaashua has said the particles are so benign that they have zero impact on the ocean.",
      "\u201cWe are not changing the water chemistry or the water biology,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has spent decades studying the biological carbon cycle of the ocean, says that while he\u2019s intrigued by Gigablue\u2019s proposal, the idea that the particles don\u2019t alter the ocean is \u201calmost inconceivable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has to be a relationship between what they\u2019re putting in the ocean and the carbon dioxide that\u2019s dissolved in seawater for this to, quote, work,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Buesseler co-leads a nonprofit group of scientists hoping to tap the power of algae in the ocean to capture carbon. The group organizes regular forums on the subject, and Gigablue presented in April.",
      "\u201cI left with more questions than answers,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Several scientists not affiliated with Gigablue interviewed by The Associated Press said they were interested in how a company with so little public information about its technology could secure a deal for 200,000 carbon credits.",
      "The success of the company\u2019s method, they said, will depend on how much algae grows on the particles, and the amount that sinks to the deep ocean. So far, Gigablue has not released any studies demonstrating those rates.",
      "Thomas Ki\u00f8rboe, a professor of ocean ecology at the Technical University of Denmark, and Philip Boyd, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania who studies the role of algae in the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, said they were doubtful algae would get enough sunlight to grow inside the particles.",
      "It\u2019s more likely the particles would attract hungry bacteria, Ki\u00f8rboe said.",
      "\u201cTypical phytoplankton do not grow on surfaces, and they do not colonize particles,\u201d Ki\u00f8rboe said. \u201cTo most phytoplankton ecologists, this would just be, I think, absurd.\u201d",
      "The rates at which Gigablue says its particles sink \u2014 up to a hundred meters (yards) per hour \u2014 might shear off algae from the particles in the quick descent, Boyd said.",
      "It\u2019s likely that some particles would also be eaten by fish \u2014 limiting the carbon capture, and raising the question of how the particles could impact marine life.",
      "Boyd is eager to see field results showing algae growth, and wants to see proof that Gigablue\u2019s particles cause the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the air.",
      "\u201cThese are incredibly challenging issues that I don\u2019t think, certainly for the biological part, I don\u2019t think anyone on the planet has got solutions for them,\u201d he said.",
      "James Kerry, a senior marine and climate scientist for the conservation group OceanCare and senior research fellow at Australia's James Cook University, has closely followed Gigablue\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is a situation of a company, a startup, upfront selling large quantities of credits for a technology that is unproven,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, Gigablue said that bacteria does consume the particles but the effect is minimal, and its measurements will account for any loss of algae or particles as they sink.",
      "The company noted that a major science institute in New Zealand has given Gigablue its stamp of approval. Gigablue hired the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, a government-owned company, to review several drafts of its methodology.",
      "In a recent letter posted to Gigablue\u2019s website, the institute\u2019s chief ocean scientist said his staff had confidence the company\u2019s work is \u201cscientifically sound\u201d and the proposed measurements for carbon sequestration were robust.",
      "Whether Gigablue\u2019s methods are deemed successful, for now, will be determined not by regulators \u2014 but by another private company.",
      "Puro.earth is one of several companies known as registries that serve the carbon credit market.",
      "Amid the lack of regulation and the potential for climate startups to overstate their impact, registries aim to verify how much carbon was really removed.",
      "The Finnish Puro.earth has verified more than a million carbon credits since its founding seven years ago. But most of those credits originated in land-based climate projects. Only recently has it aimed to set standards for the ocean.",
      "In part, that\u2019s because marine carbon credits are some of the newest to be traded. Dozens of ocean startups have entered the industry, with credit sales catapulting from 2,000 in 2021 to more than 340,000, including Gigablue\u2019s deal, last year.",
      "But the ocean remains a hostile and expensive place in which to operate a business or monitor research. Some ocean startups have sold credits only to fold before they could complete their work. Running Tide, a Maine-based startup aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere by sinking wood chips and seaweed, abruptly shuttered last year despite the backing of $50 million from investors, leaving sales of about 7,000 carbon credits unfulfilled.",
      "In June, Puro.earth published a draft methodology that will be used to verify Gigablue\u2019s work, which it designed in consultation with Gigablue. Once finalized, Gigablue will pay the registry for each metric ton of carbon dioxide that it claims to remove.",
      "Marianne Tikkanen, head of standards at Puro.earth, said that although this methodology was designed with Gigablue, her team expects other startups to adopt the same approach.",
      "\u201cWe hope that there will be many who can do it and that it stimulates the market,\u201d she said.",
      "It remains to be seen whether New Zealand officials will grant permission for the expanded \u201csequestration field\u201d that Gigablue has proposed creating, or if the company will look to other countries.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s environmental authority has so far treated Gigablue\u2019s work as research \u2014 a designation that requires no formal review process or consultations with the public. The agency said in a statement that it could not comment on how it would handle a future commercial application from Gigablue.",
      "But like many climate startups, Gigablue was involved in selling carbon credits during its research expeditions \u2014 not only inking a major deal, but smaller agreements, too.",
      "Pallas, the Italian businessman, said he ordered 22 carbon credits from Gigablue last year to offset the emissions associated with his event in November. He said Gigablue gave them to him for free \u2014 but says he will pay for more in the future.",
      "Pallas sought out carbon credits because he sees the signs of climate change all around him, he says, and expects more requirements in Italy for businesses to decarbonize in coming years. He chose Gigablue because they are one of the largest suppliers: \u201cThey\u2019ve got quantity,\u201d he said.",
      "How authorities view Gigablue\u2019s growing commercial activity could matter in the context of an international treaty that has banned certain climate operations in the ocean.",
      "More than a decade ago, dozens of countries including New Zealand agreed they should not allow any commercial climate endeavor that involves releasing iron in the ocean, a technique known as \u201ciron fertilization.\u201d Only research, they said, with no prospect of economic gain should be allowed.",
      "Iron is considered a key ingredient for spurring algae growth and was embedded in the particles that Gigablue dispersed in October in the Pacific Ocean. Several scientific papers have raised concerns that spurring iron-fueled algae blooms on a large scale would deplete important nutrients in the ocean and harm fisheries.",
      "The startup denies any link to iron dumping on the basis that its particles don\u2019t release iron directly into the water and don\u2019t create an uncontrolled algae bloom.",
      "\u201cWe are not fertilizing the ocean,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "\u201cIn fact, we looked at iron fertilization as an inspiration of something to avoid,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "But the draft methodology that Puro.earth will use to verify Gigablue\u2019s work notes many of the same concerns that have been raised about iron fertilization, including disruptions to the marine food web.",
      "Other scientists who spoke with AP see a clear link between Gigablue\u2019s work and the controversial practice. \u201cIf they\u2019re using iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth,\u201d said Kerry, the OceanCare scientist, \u201cthen it is iron fertilization.\u201d",
      "For now, scientific concerns don\u2019t seem to have troubled Gigablue\u2019s buyers. The company has already planned its next research expedition in New Zealand and hopes to release more particles this fall.",
      "\u201cThey mean well, and so do I,\u201d said Pallas, of his support for Gigablue. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll catch a plane, go to New Zealand, and grab a boat to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "It's too soon to know whether the object, designated for now as A11pl3Z, is a rocky asteroid or a icy comet, or how big and what shape it is. More observations are needed to confirm its origins. NASA said it is monitoring the situation.",

      "ATLANTA -- The nonprofit that operates Shriners Children's hospitals across North America will locate a $153 million medical research facility in Atlanta, the group announced Wednesday.",
      "Shriners Children\u2019s Research Institute intends to conduct research into cell and gene therapies, other biotechnology therapies, robotics, artificial intelligence, medical devices and the study of data.",
      "Shriners Children's operates 17 hospitals in the United States and one each in Mexico and Canada, plus clinics. The system is owned by Shriners International, a Masonic order. It specializes in treating children with orthopedic problems, burns, urology disorders and craniofacial conditions including cleft lips and palates. While the organization accepts insurance payments, it says that it treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "\u201cThis is a decision of the health care system to expand the role we play in pediatric research,\u201d said Mel Bower, a spokesperson for Shriners Children's. He said the institute will be financed using the Shriners Children's resources and should be operating within a year to 18 months.",
      "The institute projects it will have 470 employees, many of them new hires, and Georgia Tech said it will be the largest tenant at Science Square. That is a mixed-use development that Georgia Tech is developing along with the Trammell Crow Co.",
      "Georgia Tech owns the land adjoining its campus near downtown Atlanta, while the company built labs that opened last year. The development aims to emulate Georgia Tech's success in joint developments with technology companies in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood. That tech sector has been a major driver of growth in Atlanta in recent years, and officials are now trying to bolster growth from biomedical research.",
      "Leanne West, the chief engineer of pediatric technology at Georgia Tech, said the university has already conducted 25 projects with Shriners Children's. She said both Georgia Tech and Emory University will lend research expertise to the institute, and she hopes institute employees can work alongside Georgia Tech researchers.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to really help embed some of their researchers here with Georgia Tech, to walk across campus, to work in the same labs, to have that physical presence together,\u201d West said. \u201cI think we can accomplish great things by doing that.\u201d",
      "The state and local governments are providing incentives to Shriners Children\u2019s, although it is not exactly clear how that would work because nonprofits are generally exempt from income and property taxes. In Georgia, nonprofit organizations do have to pay sales taxes, which means the state could waive such taxes on equipment purchases. Jessica Atwell, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said the state won\u2019t release documents until they are finalized.",

      "Four-fifths of the genome showed links to North Africa and the region around Egypt. But a fifth of the genome showed links to the area in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, known as the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civilization flourished.",
      "\u201cThe finding is highly significant\" because it \u201cis the first direct evidence of what has been hinted at\u201d in prior work,\u201d said Daniel Antoine, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the British Museum.",

      "The skeleton was found in an Egyptian tomb complex at the archaeological site of Nuwayrat, inside a chamber carved out from a rocky hillside. An analysis of wear and tear on the skeleton \u2014 and the presence of arthritis in specific joints \u2014 indicates the man was likely in his 60s and may have worked as a potter, said co-author and bioarchaeologist Joel Irish of Liverpool John Moores University.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away.",
      "The 13% plunge in global sales over a year earlier suggests the damage to Tesla's brand from Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right European politicians is much deeper, widespread and lasting than some investors had expected. The figures reported by Tesla on Wednesday also signal that its quarterly earnings report due later this month could disappoint as rival electric-vehicle makers pounce on its weakness and steal market share. v",
      "Sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, down from 443,956 in the same three months last year.",
      "During the latest period, Musk formally left the Trump administration as a cost-cutting czar, and hopes rose that sales would recover. The Tesla CEO himself recently said the company was in the midst of a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales, a statement contradicted by the latest figures.",
      "Still, some parts of the report were encouraging. Sales of the Models 3 and Y totaled 373,728, above the estimate of 356,000 from Wall Street analysts. Tesla shares rose 5% on the news.",
      "\u201cThe numbers weren\u2019t as bad as thought with all the analyst forecast cuts we saw over the past week,\u201d said Morningstar's Seth Goldstein, though he added the report overall showed the company faces big challenges. \u201cThe current product lineup is at market saturation and Tesla will need the new affordable vehicle to grow deliveries.\u201d",
      "Musk has promised a cheaper EV model would be coming this year that would boost sales.",
      "It's not clear yet if Musk's latest feud with Trump will help lure back buyers who have been angry at the billionaire's political positions. After Musk once again took to social media to criticize Trump's budget bill, the president threatened Tuesday to use the power of his office to hurt his companies, including Tesla, pushing its stock down more than 5%.",
      "A June AP-NORC poll showed about half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans.",
      "The new figures come as Tesla is focusing less on new models and more on robots, self-driving technology and robotaxis ferrying passengers around without anyone behind the wheel.",

But it also has drawn the scrutiny of federal car safety regulators because of a few mishaps, including one case in which a Tesla cab was shown on a video heading down an opposing lane.",
      "The competition from rival EV makers is especially fierce in Europe where China's BYD has taken a bite out of its market share. Tesla sales fell 28% in May in 30 European countries even as the overall market for electric vehicles expanded sharply, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company. But he said earlier this year that much of the sales plunge is due to customers holding off while they waited for an ugrade to Tesla's best selling Model Y.

Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs.

      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and drop them from airplanes over Mexico and even southern Texas",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\u201cA thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\u201d said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\u201cIt smelled nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rotting meat.\u201d",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\u2019s Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn\u2019t be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\u201cSomething we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\u201d Burgess said.",

      "A last-ditch Republican effort to save the provision would have reduced the time frame to five years and sought to exempt some favored AI laws, such as those protecting children or country music performers from harmful AI tools.",
      "But that effort was abandoned when Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal. Voting on the amendment happened after 4 a.m. Tuesday as part of an overnight session as Republican leaders sought to secure support for the tax cut bill while fending off other proposed amendments, mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package.",

      "Some prominent tech leaders welcomed the idea after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who leads the Senate Commerce committee, floated it at a hearing in May.",

      "Musk, once an ever-present ally to Trump as he headed up the slashing agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency, broke with the Republican president over his signature legislation, which was signed into law Friday.",

But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue. And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish American people's goals. Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",

      "\"I gotta be honest with you, I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,\" Vance said in February 2022, amid an explosion of bipartisan support for the country following the aftermath of Russia's invasion.",
      "Most recently, Vance expressed concerns about the president's decision to strike the Houthis in Yemen in a Signal group chat with other top administration officials.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote in the chat. \"There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "In the lead-up to the strikes, Trump was trying to engage the MAGA base with Vance to see what their reaction would be if he ordered the bombing.",
      "Prior to the strikes, Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying back from the G7 summit in Canada that it was possible he could send Vance and special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Iranian negotiators.",
      "Vance's active role in moving Trump's agenda forward was always part of the plan.",
      "In November, following the election, a source close to the vice president told ABC News that Vance had been tasked to ensure that all of the priorities of the Trump administration move forward and would work on any of the issues Trump needed him to further, signaling that the vice president would not be assigned one specific issue to work on, but would be involved in several policy issues.",
      "It was also expected that Vance would be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" in the Senate to ensure that his agenda moves forward, the source also said. It's familiar territory for Vance, who was elected to the Senate in 2022.",
      "All this comes as Vance is viewed by some as the MAGA heir apparent to Trump ahead of the 2028 election. At the same time, he is working to raise as much money as possible for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterms as chair of the Republican National Committee -- the first time a vice president has ever held the role.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a vice-presidential scholar and former professor at Saint Louis University Law School, told ABC News that Vance is working in a different timeline compared to his predecessors, as he will serve only one term as vice president under Trump.",
      "\"Every vice presidency is different and one of the things that is unique about Vance's is that every other vice president, you know, with the possible exception of Harris, entered office with the expectation that the president was going to run for reelection,\" Goldstein said.",
      "\"I think he's in a very unique position in that his first term as vice president is his last, and so his presidential ambitions, the time for reckoning comes up, you know, much quicker than is normally the case.\"",
      "Following his tie-breaking votes in the Senate, several Democrats who might be opponents in the 2028 presidential election attempted to make Vance the face of Trump's spending bill.",
      "In a post on X, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called out Vance for casting the tie-breaking vote to allow the bill to move forward.",
      "\"VP Vance has cast the deciding vote in the Senate to cut Medicaid, take away food assistance, blow up the deficit, and add tax breaks for the wealthiest,\" Buttigieg wrote. \"This bill is unpopular because it is wrong,\" he continued.",
      "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom told Americans on X to \"bookmark\" this moment, writing that \"JD Vance is the ultimate reason why 17 million Americans will lose their healthcare.\"",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Trump pointed to Vance and Secretary of State and interim national security adviser Marco Rubio as possible successors, and said, when asked, that he believes his MAGA movement can survive without him.",
      "Asked about the president's comments, Vance said that if he does end up running for president, he's \"not entitled to it.\"",

      "Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Stephen Miran said that some countries that are negotiating with the United States in good faith could see tariffs delayed as President Donald Trump\u2019s deadline to strike trade deals closes in.",
      "Speaking with ABC News' \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos, Miran hedged on what deals are in the works.",
      "\u201cOn tariffs, the president's deadline is approaching for the deals. You've only seen three deals so far. What should we expect next?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked.",
      "\u201cI'm still optimistic that we're going to get a number of deals later this week. Part of that is because all the negotiating goes through a series of steps that lead to a culmination timed with the deadline,\u201d Miran said.",
      "Pressed on if these other deals fail to come through and if Trump would extend the deadline, Miran indicated that could be possible.",
      "\u201cWell, my expectation would be that countries that are negotiating in good faith and making the concessions that they need to get to a deal, but the deal is just not there yet because it needs more time, my expectation will be that those countries get a roll, you know, sort of get the date rolled,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked which countries could see that date shifted, Miran refused to elaborate, but said that he has heard good things about talks with Europe and India.",
      "\u201cI would expect that a number of countries that are in the process of making those concessions, you know, they might see their date rolled. For the countries that aren't making concessions, for the countries that aren't negotiating in good faith, I would expect them to sort of see higher tariffs,\u201d Miran said. \u201cBut again, the president will decide later this week and in the time following whether or not the countries are doing what it takes to get access to the American market like they've grown accustomed to.\u201d",
      "Stephanopolous was also joined by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who balked at the potential economic benefits of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt probably will collect some revenue at the cost of higher inflation for American consumers, less competitiveness for American producers,\" Summers said. \u201cSo higher prices, less competitiveness, and not really that much revenue relative to what's being given to the very wealthy in this [budget] bill.\u201d",
      "Here are more highlights from Miran and Summers' interviews:",
      "Stephanopoulos: Why should we not believe the CBO when they say that something approaching a little more than 11 million people are going to be -- are going to lose their health care coverage because of the Medicaid cuts?",
      "Miran: Well, because they've been wrong in the past. When Republicans repealed the individual mandate penalty during the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the president's first term, CBO predicted that there was going to be about 5 million people losing their insurance by 2019. And you know what? The number was not very significantly changed at all. It was a tiny fraction of that. And so, they've been wrong in the past. And look, if we don't pass the -- if we didn't pass the bill, 8 to 9 million people would've lost their insurance for sure, as a result of the biggest tax act in history creating a huge recession. The best way to make sure people are insured is to grow the economy, get them jobs, get them working, get them insurance through their employer. Creating jobs, creating a booming economy is always the best way to get people insured.",
      "Stephanopoulos: You say this is all going to turbocharge growth. We have seen some experience with this back -- in Ronald Reagan's day, back in 1981. He had huge tax cuts. The growth didn't come, and they had to end up raising taxes for several years after that. Concerned that could happen again?",
      "Miran: Well, like I said before, you know, history's on our side. If you look at what happened in the president's first term, growth soared and there was no real material, you know, meaningful long-term decline in revenue. Revenue as a share of GDP was 17.1% last year, the same as it was before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So, you got this huge surge in growth as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. There was no material long-term decline in revenue. Corporate revenue even went up as a share of GDP from 1.6 to 1.9%. And the growth delivered. And we expect the same thing to happen this time.",
      "Stephanopoulos: In The New York Times this week, you and Robert Rubin, who also served as president, as Treasury secretary, called this bill \"dangerous,\" said it \u201cposed a huge risk to the economy.\u201d What are those risks?",
      "Summers: George, just to start with, what your people have been describing is the biggest cut in the American safety net in history. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that it will kill, over 10 years, 100,000 people. That is 2,000 days of death like we've seen in Texas this weekend. In my 70 years, I\u2019ve never been as embarrassed for my country on July Fourth.These higher interest rates, these cutbacks in subsidies to electricity, these reductions in the availability of housing, the fact that hospitals are going to have to take care of these people and pass on the costs to everybody else, and that's going to mean more inflation, more risk that the Fed has to raise interest rates and run the risk of recession, more stagflation, that's the risk facing every middle-class family in our country because of this bill. And for what? A million dollars over 10 years to the top tenth of a percent of our population. Is that the highest priority use of federal money right now? I don't think so. This is a shameful act by our Congress and by our president that is going to set our country back.",
      "Stephanopoulos: Part of the president's argument is that economic growth sparked by the bill will alleviate the dangers that you talk about here. The chair of the Council of Economic Advisers is up next and his council issued a report this week projecting $11 trillion in deficit reduction from growth, higher tax revenue and savings on debt payments. How do you respond to that?",
      "Summers: It is, respectfully, nonsense. None of us can forecast what's going to happen to economic growth. What we can forecast is that when people have to hold government debt instead of being able to invest it in new capital goods, new machinery, new buildings, that makes the economy less productive. What we can forecast is that when we're investing less in research and development, investing less in our schools, that there is a negative impact on economic growth. There is no economist anywhere, without a strong political agenda, who is saying that this bill is a positive for the economy. And the overwhelming view is that it is probably going to make the economy worse. Think about it this way. How long can the world's greatest debtor remain the world's greatest power? And this is piling more debt onto the economy than any piece of tax legislation in dollar terms that we have ever had.",

      "President Donald Trump and other Republicans have long criticized states that take weeks to count their ballots after Election Day",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump and other Republicans have long criticized states that take weeks to count their ballots after Election Day. This year has seen a flurry of activity to address it.",
      "Part of Trump's executive order on elections, signed in March but held up by lawsuits, takes aim at one of the main reasons for late vote counts: Many states allow mailed ballots to be counted even if they arrive after Election Day.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last month said it would consider whether a challenge in Illinois can proceed in a case that is among several Republican-backed lawsuits seeking to impose an Election Day deadline for mail ballots.",
      "At least three states \u2014 Kansas, North Dakota and Utah \u2014 passed legislation this year that eliminated a grace period for receiving mailed ballots, saying they now need to be in by Election Day.",
      "Even in California, where weekslong vote counting is a frequent source of frustration and a target of Republican criticism, a bill attempting to speed up the process is moving through the Democratic-controlled Legislature.",
      "The ballot deadline section of Trump's wide-ranging executive order relies on an interpretation of federal law that establishes Election Day for federal elections. He argues this means all ballots must be received by that date.",
      "\u201cThis is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after Election Day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd,\u201d the executive order states.",
      "It follows a pattern for the president, who has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of such ballots even though there is no evidence they are the source of widespread fraud. The issue is tied closely to his complaints about how long it takes to count ballots, his desire for results on election night and his false claims that overnight \u201cdumps\u201d of vote counts point to a rigged election in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "But ballots received after Election Day, in addition to being signed and dated by the voter, must be postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service indicating they were completed and dropped off on or before the final day of voting.",
      "Accepting late-arriving ballots has not been a partisan issue historically. States as different as California and Mississippi allow them, while Colorado and Indiana do not.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing unreliable or insecure about a ballot that comes back after Election Day,\u201d said Steve Simon, the chief election official in Minnesota, which has an Election Day deadline.",
      "In his executive order, most of which is paused by the courts, Trump directs the attorney general to \u201ctake all necessary action\u201d to enforce federal law against states that include late-arriving ballots in their final counts for federal elections. He also directs the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to condition federal funding on compliance.",
      "Republicans in five states have passed legislation since the 2020 election moving the mail ballot deadline to Election Day, according to the Voting Rights Lab, which tracks election legislation.",
      "Earlier this year, GOP lawmakers in Kansas ended the state's practice of accepting mail ballots up to three days after Election Day, a change that will take effect for next year's midterms. Problems with mail delivery had prompted Kansas to add the grace period in 2017.",
      "Kansas state Sen. Mike Thompson, a Republican who chairs the committee that handles election legislation, compared the grace period to giving a football team extra chances to score after the game clock expires.",
      "\u201cWe need this uniform end to the election just so that we know that all voters are operating on the same time frame,\" he said.",
      "California has long been a source of complaints about the amount of time it takes for ballots to be counted and winners declared.",
      "\u201cThe rest of the country shouldn\u2019t have to wait on California to know the results of the elections,\u201d U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the Committee on House Administration, said during an April hearing.",
      "He said California's \"lax election laws\u201d were to blame for the delays.",
      "The nation's most populous state has the largest number of registered voters in the country, some 22.9 million, which is roughly equivalent to the number of voters in Florida and Georgia combined.",
      "California also has embraced universal mail voting, which means every registered voter automatically receives a ballot in the mail for each election. The deadline for election offices to receive completed ballots is seven days after Election Day as long as they are postmarked by then.",
      "A survey of some 35,000 Los Angeles County voters during last fall's election found that 40% waited until Election Day to return their ballot.",
      "Election officials say the exhaustive process for reviewing and counting mail ballots combined with a large percentage of voters waiting until the last minute makes it impossible for all results to be available on election night.",
      "Under state law, election officials in California have 30 days to count ballots, conduct a postelection review and certify the results.",
      "Dean Logan, Los Angeles County\u2019s chief election official, told Congress in May that his team counted nearly 97% of the 3.8 million ballots cast within a week of Election Day in 2024. Jesse Salinas, president of the state clerks\u2019 association, said his staff in Yolo County, near Sacramento, already works 16-hour days, seven days a week before and after an election.",
      "Assemblyman Marc Berman introduced legislation that would keep the state's 30-day certification period but require county election officials to finish counting most ballots within 13 days after the election. They would be required to notify the state if they weren't going to meet that deadline and give a reason.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that we can stick our heads in the sand and pretend like these conspiracies aren\u2019t out there and that this lack of confidence doesn\u2019t exist, in particular among Republican voters in California,\u201d said Berman, a Democrat. \u201cThere are certain good government things that we can do to strengthen our election system.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that many counties already meet the 13-day deadline in his bill, which awaits consideration in the Senate.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that this will strengthen people\u2019s confidence in their election system and their democracy by having some of those benchmarks and just making it very clear for folks when different results will be available,\u201d Berman said.",

      "The CBO says it would add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.",
      "For decades, fiscal hawks have warned about the devastating consequences of ballooning U.S. debt.",
      "But economists say this time around is different: The debt is now so large that piling more on top of it as part of President Donald Trump's massive tax cut and spending bill could set the country on a dangerous path.",
      "\"It's like the house is burning down and we're throwing in some accelerant instead of some fire extinguisher,\" said Kent Smetters, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton. \"Even without this bill, our fiscal house is burning \u2026 we're not too big to fail.\"",
      "Smetters warns that even without this bill, the U.S. was already on what he calls an \"exploding debt path,\" giving the government perhaps 20 years -- at most -- to make meaningful reforms before the consequences become severe.",
      "\"If we don't, the ramifications are pretty serious. Bond markets can be really, really disciplinary,\" Smetters said.",
      "At the center of the current debate is Trump's sweeping policy measure, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects would add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years.",
      "The White House disputes the CBO's forecast. Trump has argued on social media that stronger economic growth, coupled with tariff revenues, would offset the cost of the bill.\"Our country is going to explode with massive growth ... This bill sets us on course for enormous prosperity in the new and wonderful Golden Age of America,\" Trump wrote.",
      "But many economists disagree.",
      "Trump's bill is one of the most expensive pieces of legislation in generations, while also lowering the amount of tax revenue the country collets for decades to come.",
      "Even without this bill, the federal debt is at record levels -- roughly equal to the size of the entire U.S. economy. It's estimated about one in every four dollars paid in personal income taxes goes toward interest on the national debt.",
      "Americans should care, economists told ABC News, because bigger federal deficits mean higher interest rates. That means more expensive mortgages, car loans, and it crowds out business investments that would make workers more productive, according to Douglas Elmendorf, professor at Harvard Kennedy School and former economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers.",
      "Plus, more debt means less room to respond to crises, they say.",
      "\"It's like a family that taps out its credit cards and then has a problem with the roof of their house. You want to have a little room to maneuver in case bad things happen, and we are running out of that room,\" Elmendorf said.",
      "The U.S. navigated the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic with massive federal government spending. That debt never came down, which means the government will have fewer options in the face of another crisis.",
      "The risk of rising debt levels has felt intangible because the U.S. is the gold standard, so the expectation has been that the world will continue buying U.S. debt. As the world's largest economy and the issuer of the global reserve currency, the U.S. has long benefitted from strong demand for its debt. But that's not guaranteed -- the bond markets showed jitters earlier this year. And the fear is that investors will at some point start doubting the strength of the US economy and the ability of the U.S. to pay off their debt.",
      "Economists fear this could kick off a doom loop: the debt makes interest rates higher, which then makes the debt even bigger, making it even harder for the U.S. to sell off its debt, thus ballooning the debt even more (hence the doom loop).",
      "\"This bill will make interest rates higher and makes the risks of falling into a doom loop higher than it would be otherwise. But economists still don't know when we'd hit the doom loop,\" Elmendorf said.",
      "If that scenario unfolds, the U.S. could be forced into painful austerity.",
      "\"If we fall into a doom loop, then the U.S. has to make dramatic cutbacks in federal benefit programs like social security and Medicaid and sharply raise taxes. That will be really bad for people's standard of living. That's why it's important to take moderate actions before that happens,\" Elmendorf added.",

      "The bill imposes new 80-hour per month work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64 who don't have dependents. These requirements include working or other approved activities, such as volunteering.",
      "There are exemptions for parents or guardians of children under age 14 and those with disabilities.",

The biggest impacts will felt through the closing of health centers in rural areas, health care employers say, because there are already longstanding struggles to stay open for many of them.",
      "Health policy experts and health care workers say the biggest impacts will felt through the closing of health centers throughout the country, especially in rural areas that were heavily funded by Medicaid. Others will lose coverage because of the work requirements and the additional paperwork required under the bill.",
      "The original measure passed by the House made around $600 billion in cuts to Medicaid, but that grew with the Senate bill: new estimates from the non partisan Congressional Budget Office project federal spending on Medicaid will be reduced by $1 trillion and the number of uninsured people will increase by nearly 12 million by 2034.",
      "The Senate added a $50 billion rural hospital fund to the package to placate senators who had concerns about the impact of Medicaid cuts on their constituents, but it's unclear how the funding will be distributed or whether it will be sufficient to make up the anticipated shortfall from changes to the Medicaid provider tax.",
      "There are also proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act that take effect in 2026 and could result in millions more people losing coverage, increasing the number to 17 million.",
      "Under the bill, automatic renewal processes would be eliminated and open market insurance applicants would also be subjected to more paperwork.",
      "The bill changes work requirements for adults who are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, which would greatly reduce the number of eligible Americans.",
      "The bill raises the work requirement age from 54 to 64 and adds parents with children older than 6. Parents with dependent children at home, regardless of age, are currently exempt from these requirements.",
      "Those changes will go into effect as early as this year.",
      "The Republican spending bill also forces states to shoulder at least 5% of SNAP benefit costs starting in 2028. Currently, the program is 100% federally funded.",
      "The SNAP cuts total an estimated $230 billion over 10 years.",
      "Some of the tax changes will go into effect this year and be reflected when Americans file their taxes in 2026.",

      "The standard deduction would rise by $750 for single filers and $1,500 for those filing jointly.",

      "Trump's 2017 tax bill capped the deduction at $10,000. The 2025 spending bill increases the cap to $40,000 for households making under $500,000 and will rise 1% every year until 2029.",
      "The cap resets to $10,000 in 2030.",

    "summary": "Three years after the launch of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, the service is seeing increased call, chat and text volume and reductions in specialized offerings.",
    "story": [
      "Critics say LGBTQ youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide.",
      "Three years after the launch of the three-digit 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, the service is seeing increases in call volume, state-level support and reported effectiveness, as well as reductions in specialized offerings, including one designed to help LGBTQ youth.",
      "\"This year, the 988 Lifeline continued to provide life-saving help to millions of people, with about a 20% higher volume of calls, texts and chats compared to the year prior,\" Dr. John Palmieri, acting director of SAMHSA's 988 Lifeline Office, told ABC News via email.",
      "SAMHSA is the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the division of the Department of Health and Human Services which oversees 988.",
      "\"Recent evaluation work affirms the effectiveness of the 988 Lifeline, with studies showing that the vast majority of suicidal callers saying they thought their crisis call helped them and stopped them from killing themselves,\" he added.",
      "A network of more than 200 crisis call centers field calls, chats and texts on behalf of the Lifeline, offering support to callers experiencing suicidal crises and other forms of mental distress. This network has existed in some form for at least a couple of decades, beginning with the precursor to 988 -- the 10-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which was started in 2005.",
      "During his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, which designated 988 as the new three-digit number to call in case of a mental health emergency. The new number, intended to be easier to remember and access in times of crisis, officially launched on July 16, 2022.",
      "13 million contacts so far",
      "Since that launch date, the Lifeline has answered over 13 million calls, chats and texts across the U.S. and its territories, according to SAMHSA.",
      "\"The transition to 988 three years ago sparked coordinated efforts across the country -- inspiring local governments, states, Tribes and healthcare providers to improve crisis care response systems in communities nationwide,\" Palmieri said.",
      "Despite increasing state-level support for the Lifeline, recent downsizing efforts across the federal government have had an impact on the ability to \"build out a crisis continuum of care across the country,\" Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told ABC News.",
      "\"Interestingly, the administration has proposed flat funding for 988 for fiscal year 2026, so that was really encouraging that they're proposing keeping funding levels at [$519.6 million],\" Wesolowski said. \"But with a lot of the changes within HHS, we've seen a fair number of the staff within the 988 behavioral health crisis coordinating office depart the administration.\"",
      "The Trump administration has implemented significant workforce reductions for HHS and SAMHSA over the last few months. HHS also recently announced a major restructuring effort, which includes plans for additional staffing cuts and and the reorganization of some of the department's agencies, including SAMHSA, under a new entity called Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Asked how these changes to SAMHSA's place within the federal government may impact its oversight of 988, SAMHSA told ABC News via email that, \"The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline will continue daily, life-saving work, helping thousands of people every day and millions of people every year.\"",
      "In addition to the federal funding of 988, states offer varying levels of funding to support the Lifeline's operation. Many states have chosen to either adopt fees or recurring state appropriations in order to maintain efficient service and availability of counselors.",
      "Currently, twelve states charge a small tax on phone bills every month to fund 988 operations. This funding structure is modeled after the one used to fund 911 call centers. Those twelve states include Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Vermont.",
      "The permanent funding fees range from no cost in New York to $0.60 in Delaware.",
      "An additional five states -- Arizona, Utah, Kansas, Georgia, Florida -- have implemented recurring state appropriations, meaning those states' legislatures offer funding through their annual budget.",
      "\"We've seen an increased commitment by states to create sustainable funding mechanisms for the service and a growth in local response to people in crisis,\" Palmieri said via email.",
      "While states have been increasing resources to support 988, the Lifeline's offerings nationwide are about to change.",
      "Currently, callers to the Lifeline are prompted to press numbered options for certain specialized services -- 1 for the Veterans' Crisis Line, 2 for the Spanish-language subnetwork and 3 for LGBTQ-youth centered care.",
      "'Press 3' option for LGBTQ youth",
      "SAMHSA recently announced that the Press 3 option, which provides specialized care for LGBTQ youth, will no longer be a part of the Lifeline. That repeal was announced during LGBTQ Pride Month, just under three years after the subnetwork was first established as a pilot program in 2022.",
      "The cut came as a surprise to those working on the specialized line, including The Trevor Project, which has been operating this type of service for ten years, according to Interim Vice President of Advocacy and Government Affairs Mark Henson.",
      "Henson told ABC News that the federal funding for the service allowed The Trevor Project and other organizations to \"double our capacity to serve youth.\"",
      "Since the launch of Press 3, Henson says the option has fielded over 1.3 million calls, chats and texts. Monthly calls have also increased from 1,752 at the option's launch to 69,057 answered contacts in its last reported data from SAMHSA in May 2025.",
      "In a letter to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a bipartisan group of Congressional representatives responded to the cut announcement, noting that the subnetwork has averaged approximately 2,100 contacts per day.",
      "\"These numbers reflect the critical, ongoing demand for this targeted support,\" the members said. \"To a young person feeling alone and scared, 988 is truly a lifeline.\"",
      "In a statement announcing the discontinuation, SAMHSA said the move comes in response to significant operation costs and \"to focus on serving all help seekers, including those previously served through the Press 3 option.\"",
      "\"The Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus included a Congressional directive for $29.7 million to fund the specialized services,\" SAMHSA said. \"Federal funding in FY24 for the Press 3 services increased to $33 million. As of June 2025, more than $33 million in funds have been spent to support the subnetworks, fully expending the monies allocated for 988 Lifeline LGB+ subnetwork services.\"",
      "Despite the evident utility of the specialized option, \"Press 3 option has run out of Congressionally directed funding,\" an HHS spokesperson wrote in a statement to ABC News, adding, \"continued funding of the Press 3 threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in services.\"",
      "The Trevor Project remains adamant that the change to the program will do more harm than good because it neglects the specific challenges that people in the LGBTQ community face.",
      "\"I think there's a fundamental lack of understanding that suicide prevention is about risk and not about identity,\" Henson told ABC News. \"It's because of the life experiences and the stigma and the bullying associated with LGBTQ+ young people that make them more than four times as likely to attempt suicide.\"",
      "\"It's their life experiences and the unique drivers that have increased their risk of suicidality and therefore, have tailored care,\" he added.",
      "For NAMI's part, Wesolowski said the organization is, \"continuing to advocate with Congress,\" to reverse the decision to remove press 3, saying that, \"members of Congress on both sides of the aisle express some concern around this.\"",
      "Despite the federal shifts, Wesolowski says she hopes the foundation of 988 is strong enough to withstand political changes, both now and in the future.",
      "\"The goal has always been that anyone who's in a mental health crisis or emotional distress gets appropriate mental health care response,\" she said. \"And I think right now, the [political] uncertainty is creating a lot of concern. [But] I think there's still strong bipartisan support and cross systems support.\"",
      "If you are experiencing suicidal, substance use or other mental health crises, or are worried about a friend or loved one, please call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. You will reach a trained crisis counselor for free, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can also go to 988lifeline.org.",

      "One local summer camp in the path of the disastrous flooding in central Texas was able to avoid any loss of life by closely monitoring weather reports",
      "It was about 1 a.m. on the Fourth of July when the facilities manager at a central Texas summer camp saw water from the Guadalupe River steadily rising amid a deluge of rain.",
      "Aroldo Barrera notified his boss, who had been monitoring reports of the storms approaching Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly, a recreation destination where an intercultural youth conference had been called off early just hours earlier.",
      "Despite an absence of warning by local authorities, camp officials acted quickly on their own, relocating about 70 children and adults staying overnight in a building near the river. With the kids safe, camp leaders including President and CEO Tim Huchton were able to avoid the catastrophe that hit at least one other camp near Hunt, where the 500-acre Mo-Ranch is located.",
      "\u201cThey helped them pack up,\u201d Lisa Winters, communications director for Mo-Ranch, told The Associated Press on Sunday. \u201cThey got them up, they got them out, put them up on higher ground.\u201d",
      "Other places fared much worse.",
      "Flash floods that roared through Texas Hill Country before dawn on Friday decimated the landscape near the river, leaving at least 79 dead and many others unaccounted for. As of Sunday, 10 girls from nearby Camp Mystic remained missing, officials said. Rescue and recovery teams combed the area for them and others still unaccounted for days after the flood.",
      "The decision to leave added to the mounting accounts of how camps and residents in the area say they were left to make their own decisions in the absence of warnings or notifications from the county.",
      "Local authorities have faced heavy scrutiny and at times have deflected questions about how much warning they had or were able to provide the public, saying the reviews will come later. For now, they say they're focusing on rescues. Officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months\u2019 worth of rain for the area.",
      "Mo-Ranch suffered no loss of life, said Winters, adding that the camp received no direct information from county officials about flooding that could \u2014 and did \u2014 take lives.",
      "\u201cWe had no warning this was coming,\" Winters said, adding that it would have been \u201cdevastating\u201d had camp officials not been looking at weather reports and the rising river waters.",
      "Mo-Ranch \u201csaw it coming well in advance and they did something about it,\u201d she said.",
      "By about 7 a.m. Friday, camp staff began contacting children's parents, telling them their kids were safe.",
      "\u201cThey knew that those parents would wake up and just see all this media footage of kids lost, or the river,\u201d Winters said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018tell your parents you\u2019re OK\u2019 \u2026 We made sure every single guest, every single kid, was accounted for.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe buildings don\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine losing children, or people.\u201d",

      "KERRVILLE, Texas -- KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) \u2014 Flash floods in Texas killed at least 82 people over the Fourth of July holiday weekend and left others still missing, including girls attending a summer camp. The devastation along the Guadalupe River, outside of San Antonio, has drawn a massive search effort as officials face questions over their preparedness and the speed of their initial actions.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly flooding, the colossal weather system that drove it in and around Kerr County, Texas, and ongoing efforts to identify victims.",
      "The floods grew to their worst at the midpoint of a long holiday weekend when many people were asleep.",
      "The Texas Hill Country in the central part of the state is naturally prone to flash flooding due to the dry dirt-packed areas where the soil lets rain skid along the surface of the landscape instead of soaking it up. Friday's flash floods started with a particularly bad storm that dropped most of its 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain in the dark early morning hours.",
      "After a flood watch notice midday Thursday, the National Weather Service office issued an urgent warning around 4 a.m. that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. By at least 5:20 a.m., some in the Kerrville City area say water levels were getting alarmingly high. The massive rain flowing down hills sent rushing water into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday that there were 41 people confirmed to be unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.",
      "In Kerr County, home to youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, searchers have found the bodies of 68 people, including 28 children, Sheriff Larry Leitha said Sunday afternoon. Fatalities in nearby counties brought the total number of deaths to 79 as of Sunday evening.",
      "Ten girls and a counselor were still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river.",
      "For past campers, the tragedy turned happy memories into grief.",
      "Beyond the Camp Mystic campers unaccounted for, the number of missing from other nearby campgrounds and across the region had not been released.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t even want to begin to estimate at this time,\u201d Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said Saturday, citing the likely influx of visitors during the July Fourth holiday.",
      "Survivors have described the floods as a \u201cpitch black wall of death\u201d and said they received no emergency warnings.",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, who lives along the Guadalupe River, said Saturday that \u201c nobody saw this coming.\u201d Various officials have referred to it as a \u201c100-year-flood,\u201d meaning that the water levels were highly unlikely based on the historical record.",
      "And records behind those statistics don\u2019t always account for human-caused climate change. Though it\u2019s hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur, meteorologists say that a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and allow severe storms to dump even more rain.",
      "Additionally, officials have come under scrutiny about why residents and youth summer camps along the river were not alerted sooner than 4 a.m. or told to evacuate.",
      "Officials noted that the public can grow weary from too many flooding alerts or forecasts that turn out to be minor.",
      "Kerr county officials said they had presented a proposal for a more robust flood warning system, similar to a tornado warning system, but that members of the public reeled at the cost.",
      "On Sunday, officials walked out of a news briefing after reporters asked them again about delays in alerts and evacuations.",
      "The flash floods have erased campgrounds and torn homes from their foundations.",
      "\"It\u2019s going to be a long time before we\u2019re ever able to clean it up, much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said Saturday after surveying the destruction from a helicopter.",

      "HOUSTON -- Getting ready for a hurricane\u2019s landfall means making sure everyone in your household is prepared, including your furry family members.",
      "It\u2019s important that the work in gathering essential items for your dog or cat and determining if your pets have their ID tags and are microchipped is done before a storm is bearing down, said Julie Kuenstle, a spokeswoman for the Houston Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.",
      "\u201cAll of that stuff needs to be done in advance because you can\u2019t do that obviously if your pet gets away before, during or after a disaster. And that\u2019s heartbreaking because we know that our pets are our family members,\u201d Kuenstle said.",
      "Just as the humans in your family require an emergency kit with food, water and medications, pets also need one. Their go bags will be a little different and should include things like chew toys, leashes and poop bags.",
      "Kuenstle said it\u2019s also important the kit has hard copies of your pets' vaccination records that you can show if you have to evacuate and end up at a hotel or shelter.",
      "\u201cA lot of items that pet owners need and are essential for their go bags, they already have around their house,\u201d Kuenstle said.",
      "Cesar Perea, the associate vice president of rescue for the American Humane Society, said people should also verify that their pets have ID tags on their collars and that the information linked to their pet\u2019s microchip is up to date and that multiple people are listed as contacts.",
      "\u201cIf you decide you want to ride out the storm and stay, we wouldn\u2019t recommend that,\u201d Perea said. \u201cBut if they do, typically, we tell people that you should have at least two-weeks worth of (pet) supplies in your home.\u201d",
      "Pets can sense any stress their owners feel as they prepare for a hurricane, Kuenstle said.",
      "\u201cWhen there is a disaster or storm, sirens, things like that, a natural fear response is for them \u2026 to hide and to run away. So, you know, making sure that your yard is secure and that they\u2019re in a quiet, safe, secure place can help avoid that,\u201d she said.",
      "Animal rescue groups say it\u2019s important to have your pet crate trained so their crate can be used as a safe space for your pets.",
      "People who decide to stay and ride out a storm should keep their pets close, Perea said. Leaving them alone in another room \u201cis just going to elevate their stress,\u201d he added.",
      "Leaving pets behind, particularly if they're left tied to a fence or chained in a backyard, can be deadly.",
      "\u201cIf the disaster comes along, they can\u2019t move away from it,\u201d Perea said. \u201cThe disaster rolls through and they suffer a horrific death potentially.\u201d",
      "Abandoning your pets could also result in animal cruelty charges.",
      "The plight of a bull terrier named Trooper, who was rescued last year during Hurricane Milton after being found chained to a fence along a Tampa highway, inspired a new Florida law that imposes tougher penalties on people who abandon pets during natural disasters.",
      "Most emergency operations centers during a natural disaster focus part of their work on animal rescues, Perea said.",
      "But both Perea and Kuenstle said most pets and other animals needing rescue are not abandoned on purpose.",
      "During Hurricane Harvey in Houston in 2017, Kuenstle's group rescued about 2,300 animals, including cats, dogs and horses, reuniting about 300 of them with their humans.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was ... \u2019We had no idea we wouldn\u2019t be able to come back.\u2019 They were contacting us in a panic. They were concerned about their pet,\u201d Kuenstle said.",
      "The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 is filled with countless stories of residents not wanting to leave their flooded homes if they couldn\u2019t bring their furry loved ones, Perea said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Eight men deported from the United States in May and held under guard for weeks at an American military base in the African nation of Djibouti while their legal challenges played out in court have now reached the Trump administration's intended destination, war-torn South Sudan, a country the State Department advises against travel to due to \u201ccrime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\u201d",
      "The immigrants from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan arrived in South Sudan on Friday after a federal judge cleared the way for the Trump administration to relocate them in a case that had gone to the Supreme Court, which had permitted their removal from the U.S. Administration officials said the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis was a win for the rule of law, safety and security of the American people,\u201d said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in a statement Saturday announcing the men's arrival in South Sudan, a chaotic country in danger once more of collapsing into civil war.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the transfer of the men who had been put on a flight in May bound for South Sudan. That meant that the South Sudan transfer could be completed after the flight was detoured to a base in Djibouti, where they men were held in a converted shipping container. The flight was detoured after a federal judge found the administration had violated his order by failing to allow the men a chance to challenge the removal.",

      "By Friday evening, that judge had issued a brief ruling concluding the Supreme Court had tied his hands.",

      "Meteorologists say incredible amounts of moisture in the air fueled a storm that moved slowly over central Texas, creating conditions for fatal flash floods",
      "WASHINGTON -- Incredible amounts of moisture in the air fueled a storm that moved slowly and dumped rain over central Texas, creating conditions for fatal flash floods in the early morning hours when it was easy to catch people by surprise, meteorologists said.",
      "More than 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Texas Hill Country over a span of several hours early Friday, causing water levels to quickly rise, according to the weather forecasting company AccuWeather. The area is naturally prone to flash flooding, but this was an especially bad storm that hit during the vulnerable overnight hours, experts said. Dozens of deaths have been reported along with numerous rescues.",
      "Meteorologists said that an atmosphere warmed by human-caused climate change can hold more moisture and allow bad storms to dump more rain, though it\u2019s hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur.",
      "\u201cIn a warming climate we know that the atmosphere has more moisture to give, to hold on to and then to release. But also the thing that we know about climate change is that our rain events are not as uniform as what they used to be,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist with Climate Central. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll get these big rain events happening in localized areas, tapping into the historic level of moisture in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, flash flooding driven by bursts of heavy rain turned deadly elsewhere in Texas and in West Virginia. In San Antonio in June, more than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain fell over a span of hours, prompting dozens of rescues from the fast-rising floodwaters and killing at least 13. And in West Virginia that month, at least nine people died when as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain fell within 40 minutes and caused flash flooding in the Wheeling area.",
      "Robert Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said this latest Texas rain storm was roughly a once-in-a-generation event. It fell in the Texas Hill Country where water quickly shoots down rugged hills into narrow river basins that swell quickly.",
      "\u201cAs is often the case with the worst disasters, many things came together in a terrible way.\u201d Henson said.",
      "Plus, the area had been in a drought, so the water ran down the dry, hard land fast. That made it more dangerous for children attending camp.",
      "\u201cA sudden surge of rain like that is going to have a harder time getting absorbed,\u201d said Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. \u201cIt just runs right off of it. It\u2019s like concrete.\u201d",
      "The sheer amount of rain was overwhelming. Former NOAA chief scientist Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist, calculated Saturday morning that the storm had dropped 120 billion gallons of water on Kerr County, which received the brunt of the storm.",
      "Moisture fueled the storm from many directions. Tropical Storm Barry formed briefly last weekend, moving over Mexico and then its remnants continued up into Texas. But the jet stream, a current of air that moves weather patterns, wasn\u2019t there to push that moisture away.",
      "\u201cNormally weather systems and the remnants of tropical systems will get picked up by the jet stream, and that\u2019s just not over Texas currently,\u201d said Winkley, the Climate Central meteorologist. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a weather system without a road to get away from the Lone Star State.\u201d",
      "The warm water of the Gulf fueled the moist atmosphere. Even more moisture came from areas over the Pacific Ocean to the west. The combination gave the storm plenty of fuel once it got started.",
      "Winkley said in the area that flooded, climate change might mean that rain storms are less common, but when they do occur they can be more severe.",
      "Generally a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, creating conditions for storms to drop more rain.",
      "\u201cWith climate change we have a warming atmosphere. A warmer atmosphere holds a lot more moisture, and we are seeing obviously much more total atmospheric moisture across the globe in recent years than we normally have,\u201d said Anderson, the AccuWeather meteorologist.",

      "NEW YORK -- Eight members of the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries say they will boost production by 548,000 barrels per day in August in a move that could further reduce gas prices this year.",
      "The group that includes Saudi Arabia and Russia made the decision at a virtual meeting Saturday. They cited a \u201csteady global economic outlook\" and low oil inventories.",
      "Oil prices spiked sharply last month during the bloody, 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran but then tumbled back down as the U.S. helped broker a peace deal after dropping bombs on three of Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites.",

      "A statement said the new measures were in accordance with a December decision to put off increasing production at that time, but gradually increase it by 2.2 million barrels per day over an 18-month period starting in April and ending in fall 2026.

      "Twenty people were killed when creeks near the small Middle Tennessee town of Waverly overflowed after more than more than 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain fell in the area in less than 24 hours in August 2021.",

      "Hurricane Harvey barreled into Texas in August 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. Harvey hovered for days as it trudged inland, dumping several feet of rain on many Gulf Coast communities and the Houston area.",
      "Harvey killed at least 68 people, according to a National Hurricane Center report. All but three of the Harvey deaths were directly attributed to freshwater flooding, which damaged more than 300,000 structures and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage.",
      "A rainstorm that initially seemed like no big deal turned into a catastrophe in West Virginia, trapping dozens of people during the night and eventually leaving 23 people dead around the state.",
      "Superstorm Sandy was a late fall freak combination of a hurricane and other storms that struck New York and surrounding areas in October 2012.",
      "Sandy killed 147 people, 72 in the eastern U.S., according to the National Hurricane Center. More than 110 deaths were attributed to drowning, Roys said.",
      "Heavy rainfall in several states, plus a larger-than-normal slow melt, led rivers in the Mississippi River Basin to swell and flood in 2011.",
      "Flash floods associated with these storms caused 24 deaths across Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee in April and May, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hurricane Ike struck the southeast Texas Gulf Coast in September 2008, creating a storm surge as high as 20 feet (6 meters) in the island city of Galveston.",
      "Ike then poured more than 4 feet (1.2 meters) of rain on Houston, destroying thousands of cars and leaving hundreds of thousands of families with flood-damaged homes.",
      "In all, Ike was responsible for more than 100 deaths, many caused by flooding.",
      "Hurricane Katrina is the deadliest flood event in the U.S. in the past 25 years.",
      "The storm crashed into the Gulf Coast and caused devastating flooding when levees failed in New Orleans, where people had to be rescued by boat and helicopter from rooftops.",
      "The costliest storm in U.S. history, Katrina caused nearly 1,400 deaths and an estimated $200 billion in damages.",
      "Tropical Storm Allison caused 41 deaths, mostly attributed to flooding caused by 40 inches (101 centimeters) of rain that fell in Texas and Louisiana, Roys said.",
      "Allison remained a threat for days as its remnants lingered after making landfall in June 2001, causing major flooding in Houston.",

      "At least 43 people, including 15 children, died in Kerr County after a storm unleashed nearly a foot (0.3 meters) of rain on Friday and sent floodwaters gushing out of the Guadalupe River through the hilly region known for its century-old summer camps. Another eight people died in nearby counties.",
      "State officials said 27 girls from Camp Mystic, a riverside Christian camp for girls in Hunt, Texas, still were unaccounted for about 36 hours after the flood.",
      "An 8-year-old girl from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who was at Camp Mystic, and the director of another camp just up the road were among those confirmed dead Saturday.",

      "Many more are still missing, and authorities said about 850 people had been rescued so far.",
      "The National Weather Service said a flood watch would remain in effect for the Hill Country region through late Saturday night.",
      "The camp was established in 1926. It grew so popular over the following decades that families are now encouraged to put prospective campers on the waitlist years in advance.",
      "Photos and videos taken before the flood are idyllic, showing large cabins with green-shingled roofs and names like \u201cWiggle Inn,\u201d tucked among sturdy oak and cypress trees that grow on the banks of the Guadalupe River. In some social media posts, girls are fishing, riding horses, playing kickball or performing choreographed dance routines in matching T-shirts. Girls ranging in age from 8 to 17 years old pose for the camera with big smiles, arms draped across the shoulders of their fellow campers.",

A wall is torn entirely off one building, the interior empty except for a Texas flag and paintings hung high along one side. A twisted bit of metal \u2014 perhaps a bedframe \u2014 is stacked next to colorful steamer trunks and broken tree limbs.",

      "The National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the region on Thursday, and it sent out a series of flash-flood warnings in the early hours Friday. The federal agency had predicted 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) of rain in the region northwest of San Antonio, but 10 inches (25.4 cm) fell.",
      "The Guadalupe River rose to 26 feet (7.9 meters) within about 45 minutes in the early morning hours, submerging its flood gauge.",

      "Elinor Lester, 13, said she was evacuated with her cabinmates by helicopter after wading through floodwaters. She recalled startling awake around 1:30 a.m. as thunder crackled and water pelted the cabin windows.",
      "Lester was among the older girls housed on elevated ground known as Senior Hill. Cabins housing the younger campers, who can start attending at age 8, are situated along the riverbanks and were the first to flood, she said.",

      "Her mother, Elizabeth Lester, said her son was nearby at Camp La Junta and also escaped. A counselor there woke up to find water rising in the cabin, opened a window and helped the boys swim out. Camp La Junta and nearby Camp Waldemar said in Instagram posts that all campers and staff were safe.",
      "Elizabeth Lester sobbed when she saw her daughter, who was clutching a small teddy bear and a book.",
      "\u201cMy kids are safe, but knowing others are still missing is just eating me alive,\" she said.",
      "Dozens of families shared in local Facebook groups that they received devastating phone calls from safety officials informing them that their daughters had not yet been located among the washed-away camp cabins and downed trees. Camp Mystic said in an email to parents of the roughly 750 campers that if they have not been contacted directly, their child is accounted for.",
      "Camp Mystic sits on a strip known to locals as \u201cflash flood alley.\"",

      "Chloe Crane, a teacher and former Camp Mystic counselor, said her heart broke when a fellow teacher shared an email from the camp about the missing girls.",
      "\u201cTo be quite honest, I cried because Mystic is such a special place, and I just couldn\u2019t imagine the terror that I would feel as a counselor to experience that for myself and for 15 little girls that I\u2019m taking care of,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also just sadness, like the camp has been there forever and cabins literally got washed away.\u201d",
      "Crane said the camp is a haven for young girls looking to gain confidence and independence. She recalled happy memories teaching her campers about journalism, making crafts and competing in a camp-wide canoe race at the end of each summer. Now for many campers and counselors, their happy place has turned into a horror story, she said.",

      "A federal judge on Friday temporarily halted deportations of eight immigrants to war-torn South Sudan the day after the Supreme Court greenlighted their removal, saying new claims by the immigrants' lawyers deserved a hearing.",
      "District Judge Randolph Moss proceeded with the extraordinary Fourth of July hearing on Friday afternoon, directing the Trump administration to discuss whether a prior Supreme Court ruling that immigrants slated for removal under an 18th century wartime act invoked by President Donald Trump deserve due process might also apply to those due to be removed to South Sudan.",
      "The administration has been trying to deport the immigrants for weeks. None are from South Sudan, which is enmeshed in civil war and where the U.S government advises no one should travel before making their own funeral arrangements. The government flew them to Djibouti but couldn't move them further because a Massachusetts court had ruled no immigrant could be sent to a new country without a chance to have a court hearing.",
      "The Supreme Court vacated that decision last month, then Thursday night issued a new order clarifying that that meant the immigrants could be moved to South Sudan. Lawyers for the immigrants, who hail from Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and other countries, filed an emergency request to halt their removal later that night.",

    "story": [
      "Fireworks are a cornerstone of America's Fourth of July celebrations, but that can make the spirited holiday dangerous",
      "St. Louis -- The Fourth of July is Americana at its core: parades and cookouts and cold beer and, of course, fireworks.",
      "Those pyrotechnics also make it an especially dangerous holiday, typically resulting in more than 10,000 trips to the emergency room. Yet fireworks remain at the center of Independence Day, a holiday 247 years in the making.",
      "Here are five things to know about July Fourth, including the origin of the holiday and how fireworks became part of the tradition.",
      "The holiday celebrates the Second Continental Congress\u2019 unanimous adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, a document announcing the colonies\u2019 separation from Great Britain.",
      "One year later, according to the Library of Congress, a spontaneous celebration in Philadelphia marked the anniversary of American independence.",
      "But across the burgeoning nation, observations didn\u2019t become commonplace until after the War of 1812. It quickly took off: The Library of Congress notes that major historic events in the 19th century, such as groundbreaking ceremonies for the Erie Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, were scheduled to coincide with Fourth of July festivities.",
      "The display of pyrotechnics has been a big part of Independence Day from the outset. Founding Father John Adams saw it coming.",
      "Commemoration of America\u2019s independence \u201cought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,\u201d Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, dated July 3, 1776.",
      "Fireworks were around centuries before America became a nation. The American Pyrotechnics Association says many historians believe fireworks were first developed in the second century B.C. in ancient China by throwing bamboo stalks into fires, causing explosions as the hollow air pockets overheated.",
      "By the 15th century, fireworks were widely used for religious festivals and public entertainment in Europe and early U.S. settlers carried on those traditions, the association said.",
      "Presidents from George Washington to Donald Trump have celebrated the nation\u2019s birth on the Fourth of July, with one exception: Adams.",
      "His letter to his wife aside, Adams refused to celebrate the holiday on July 4 because he felt July 2 was the real Independence Day. Why? It was on July 2, 1776, that the Continental Congress voted in favor of the resolution for independence, though the Declaration of Independence wasn\u2019t formally adopted until two days later.",
      "Adams was so adamant that he turned down invitations to festivals and other events, even while serving as the nation\u2019s second president. Ironically, Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, both died on the 50th anniversary of the document\u2019s formal adoption, July 4, 1826.",
      "Consumer sales of fireworks have grown rapidly over the past two decades.",
      "Statistics from the American Pyrotechnics Association show that in 2000, American consumers spent $407 million on fireworks. By 2024, that figure rose to $2.2 billion. The biggest jump came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when public fireworks displays were shut down. Consumer sales jumped from $1 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2020.",
      "The cost of fireworks could soar if the trade war between the U.S. and China continues \u2014 most aerial shells, paper rockets and sparkly fountains that transfix the eyes of Americans every Fourth of July are imported from China. A 90-day pause on Trump's hefty tariffs on Chinese imports brought some temporary relief, but industry experts are uncertain as they watch for an agreement.",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, thousands of Americans are badly injured by fireworks each year.",
      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that in 2024, 11 deaths were blamed on fireworks, up 38% from 2023. An estimated 1,700 people were treated at emergency rooms for sparkler-related injuries and 14,7000 people were injured from fireworks \u2014 a 52% increase compared to 2023.",
      "Burns were the most common injury. People hurt their hands and fingers most often, and head, face and ear injuries were frequent, too.",
      "For those planning to shoot off fireworks, experts urge finding a flat, hard, level surface away from structures and other things that could catch fire. The person responsible for the fireworks should avoid alcohol. Children should never ignite them.",
      "Experts have also encouraged having a bucket or hose nearby in case of fire or explosion. Shoot off one at a time and walk away quickly after igniting, she said, and never relight or handle a malfunctioned firework. When done, shovel up the remains and soak them before disposing.",

      "Millions of protesters have denounced President Donald Trump as a would-be autocrat and marched under the banner \u201cNo Kings.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Alarmed by the policies of President Donald Trump, millions turned out last month for protests around the United States and overseas. Mindful of next year\u2019s 250th anniversary of American independence, organizers called the movement \u201cNo Kings.\u201d",
      "Had the same kind of rallies been called for in the summer of 1775, the response likely would have been more cautious.",
      "\u201cIt ('No Kings') was probably a minority opinion in July 1775,\u201d says H.W. Brands, a prize-winning scholar and chair of the history department at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of passion for revolution in New England, but that was different from the rest of the country,\u201d says Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Joseph Ellis. \u201cThere were still people who don't want to drawn into what they feared was an unnecessary war.\u201d",
      "This month marks the 250th anniversary \u2014 the semiquincentennial \u2014 of a document enacted almost exactly a year before the Declaration of Independence: \u201cThe Olive Branch Petition,\u201d ratified July 5, 1775 by the Continental Congress. Its primary author was John Dickinson, a Pennsylvanian whose writing skills led some to call him the \u201cPenman of the Revolution,\u201d and would stand as a final, desperate plea to reconcile with Britain.",
      "The notion of \u201cNo Kings\u201d is a foundation of democracy. But over the first half of 1775 Dickinson and others still hoped that King George III could be reasoned with and would undo the tax hikes and other alleged abuses they blamed on the British Parliament and other officials. Ellis calls it the \u201cAwkward Interval,\u201d when Americans had fought the British in Lexington and Concord and around Bunker Hill, while holding off from a full separation.",
      "\u201cPublic opinion is changing during this time, but it still would have been premature to issue a declaration of independence,\u201d says Ellis, whose books include \u201cFounding Brothers,\u201d \u201cThe Cause\u201d and the upcoming \u201cThe Great Contradiction.\"",
      "The Continental Congress projected unity in its official statements. But privately, like the colonies overall, members differed. Jack Rakove, a professor of history at Stanford University and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cOriginal Meanings,\u201d noted that delegates to Congress ranged from \u201cradicals\u201d such as Samuel Adams who were avid for independence to such \u201cmoderates\u201d as Dickinson and New York's John Jay.",
      "The Olive Branch resolution balanced references to \u201cthe delusive pretences, fruitless terrors, and unavailing severities\u201d administered by British officials with dutiful tributes to shared ties and to the king's \u201croyal magnanimity and benevolence.\u201d",
      "\u201c(N)otwithstanding the sufferings of your loyal Colonists during the course of this present controversy, our Breasts retain too tender a regard for the Kingdom from which we derive our Origin to request such a Reconciliation as might in any manner be inconsistent with her Dignity or her welfare,\u201d the sometimes obsequious petition reads in part.",
      "The American Revolution didn\u2019t arise at a single moment but through years of anguished steps away from the \u201cmother\u201d country \u2014 a kind of weaning that at times suggested a coming of age, a young person\u2019s final departure from home. In letters and diaries written in the months before July 1775, American leaders often referred to themselves as children, the British as parents and the conflict a family argument.",
      "Edmund Pendleton, a Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress, urged \u201ca reconciliation with Our mother Country.\u201d Jay, who would later help negotiate the treaty formally ending the Revolutionary War, proposed informing King George that \u201cyour majesty\u2019s American subjects\u201d are \u201cbound to your majesty by the strongest ties of allegiance and affection and attached to their parent country by every bond that can unite societies.\u201d",
      "In the Olive Branch paper, Dickinson would offer tribute to \u201cthe union between our Mother country and these colonies.\u201d",
      "The Congress, which had been formed the year before, relied in the first half of 1775 on a dual strategy that now might be called \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d a blend of resolve and compromise. John Adams defined it as \u201cto hold the sword in one hand, the olive branch in the other.\u201d Dickinson's petition was a gesture of peace. A companion document, \u201cThe Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms,\" was a statement of resolve.",
      "The 1775 declaration was drafted by Thomas Jefferson, who a year later would be the principal writer of the Declaration of Independence, revised by Dickinson and approved by the Congress on July 6. The language anticipated the Declaration of Independence with its condemnation of the British for \u201ctheir intemperate Rage for unlimited Domination\u201d and its vows to \u201cmake known the Justice of our Cause.\u201d",
      "But while the Declaration of Independence ends with the 13 colonies \u201cabsolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\u201d the authors in 1775 assured a nervous public \u201cthat we mean not to dissolve that Union which has so long and so happily subsisted between us, and which we sincerely wish to see restored.\u201d",
      "\u201cNecessity has not yet driven us into that desperate Measure, or induced us to excite any other Nation to war against them,\u201d they wrote.",
      "John Adams and Benjamin Franklin were among the peers of Dickinson who thought him naive about the British, and were unfazed when the king refused even to look at the Olive Branch petition and ruled that the colonies were in a state of rebellion. Around the same time Dickinson was working on his draft, the Continental Congress readied for further conflict. It appointed a commander of the newly-formed Continental Army, a renowned Virginian whom Adams praised as \u201cmodest and virtuous ... amiable, generous and brave.\"",
      "His name: George Washington. His ascension, Adams wrote, \"will have a great effect, in cementing and securing the Union of these Colonies.\u201d",

      "States and rural health advocacy groups are sounding the alarm that Congress\u2019 slashing of Medicaid will devastate already financially fragile rural hospitals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.",
      "Now, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.",
      "\u201cOur budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it\u2019ll be difficult to keep the doors open,\u201d said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.",
      "If those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.",
      "\u201cThat's a long way for an emergency,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cSome won't make it.\u201d",
      "States and rural health advocacy groups warn that cutting Medicaid \u2014 a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.",
      "More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure under the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which tracks rural hospital closures. Even as Congress haggled over the controversial bill, a health clinic in the southwest Nebraska town of Curtis announced Wednesday it will close in the coming months, in part blaming the anticipated Medicaid cuts.",
      "Bruce Shay, of Pomfret, Connecticut, fears he and his wife could be among those left in the lurch. At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, \u201cit's going to be an emergency.\u201d",
      "Day Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has faced recent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday \u2014 estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years \u2014 would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball\u2019s current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that\u2019s even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.",
      "\u201cAn emergency means I\u2019m 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that\u2019s a problem,\" Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got, I\u2019m sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that\u2019s probably already stretched thin.\u201d",
      "Rural hospitals have long operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs \u2014 cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.",
      "But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.",
      "Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.",
      "\u201cWe see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,\" Cochran-McClain said. \"Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer \u2014 especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding \u2014 is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.\u201d",
      "A KFF report shows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky.",
      "The report estimates the Bluegrass State would lose a whopping $12.3 billion \u2014 nearly $5 billion more than the next state on the list. That's because the bill ends Kentucky's unique Medicaid reimbursement system and reduces it to Medicare reimbursement levels.",
      "Kentucky currently has one of the lowest Medicare reimbursement rates in the country. It also has one of the highest poverty rates, leading to a third of its population being covered by Medicaid.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat widely seen as a potential candidate for president in 2028, said the bill would close 35 hospitals in his state and pull health care coverage for 200,000 residents.",
      "\u201cHalf of Kentucky\u2019s kids are covered under Medicaid. They lose their coverage and you are scrambling over that next prescription,\u201d Beshear said during an appearance on MSNBC. \u201cThis is going to impact the life of every single American negatively. It is going to hammer our economy.\"",

      "Border Patrol arrests along the southern border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since 1966, including a 30% drop in June.",
      "On June 28, the Border Patrol made only 137 arrests, a stark contrast with late 2023 when arrests topped 10,000 on the busiest days.",

      "The U.S. military wants to keep training at this spot, called Pohakuloa, so it's ready to quickly send troops to Asia and the Pacific. Its importance to the U.S. is only growing as China becomes more assertive, particularly regarding Taiwan.",
      "But the Army's lease for state lands beneath a key part of the training range expires in 2029. Native Hawaiians upset with the U.S. military\u2019s history of damaging Hawaiian lands with target practice and fuel leaks want the Army out.",
      "\u201cThey have bombed and contaminated not just our land but our waters,\u201d said Healani Sonoda-Pale, a community organizer with the Hawaiian sovereignty group Ka Lahui Hawaii. \u201cWhen does this end?\u201d",

      "Memories are still fresh from when the Navy spilled jet fuel into Pearl Harbor\u2019s drinking water from a network of underground fuel storage tanks and pipes in 2021. The leak prompted 6,000 people to seek medical care for rashes, nausea and other ailments and contaminated a Honolulu aquifer. The disaster occurred after admirals spent years dismissing community calls to move the tanks. On Tuesday, Honolulu's water utility sued the Navy seeking to recoup an estimated $1.2 billion that it has had to spend because of the spill.",
      "Also on Oahu, environmental advocates say Army live-fire training in Makua Valley sparked wildfires and destroyed native forestland and sacred cultural sites. A legal settlement stopped such training in 2004.",
      "Pohakuloa consists of rocky plains, hills and brush about 6,200 feet (1,900 meters) above sea level between the Big Island\u2019s tallest volcanoes, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. It hosts endangered species including the Hawaiian catchfly shrub.",

      "Pohakuloa Training Area spans more than 200 square miles (518 square kilometers). The section in question is only 17% of that total, but it\u2019s critically located in between two larger federal parcels. Troops fire munitions from the state-owned parcel onto federal lands.",

      "On May 9, the state land board rejected it after hearing hours of often emotional testimony in opposition. Among other issues, the board cited inadequate inventory of unexploded ordnance and insufficient inventory of ancient burials and associated artifacts.",

      "Coral breeding has also been done in Hawaii, where in 2021, scientists were working to speed up the coral\u2019s evolutionary clock to breed \u201csuper corals\u201d that can better withstand the impacts of global warming.",
      "Baker's group teamed with the Florida Aquarium and Tela Coral, bringing in fragments of corals from a warm reef off of Tela, Honduras, which spawned in tanks at the aquarium.",
      "\u201cWe were able to cross the spawn from those corals, the sperm and the eggs, to produce babies. One parent from Florida, one parent from Honduras,\u201d Baker said.",
      "They chose the reef off of Tela because the water is about 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the water off the coast of Florida.",
      "\u201cAnd yet the corals in those environments, and especially the Elkhorn corals, are really thriving,\u201d Baker said.",
      "He noted that there are extensive beds that are hundreds of meters long, full of flourishing Elkhorn.",
      "\u201cAnd yet they survive there despite really warm conditions and also quite nutrient-polluted waters,\u201d Baker said.",
      "The conditions are similar to those Florida will face over the next century, Baker said.",
      "It's also the first time international crossbreeding of corals has been permitted for planting onto wild reefs.",
      "\u201cSo we're really excited to see how these do,\u201d he said.",
      "The hope is the corals will be more \u201cthermally tolerant,\u201d which Baker and the team will be testing throughout the summer.",
      "Elkhorn corals are some of Florida's most iconic species and are valuable because they form the crest of the reef, Baker said.",
      "\u201cAnd the reef is what protects shorelines from storms and flooding. So if you have healthy Elkhorn coral populations, you have a great reef that is acting almost like a speed bump over which waves and storms pass and dissipate their energy before they hit the coast,\u201d he said.",
      "Elkhorn corals are in serious decline, thanks in part to the coral bleaching in 2023 and warming sea temperatures, Baker said.",
      "While coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them, prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds. The coral ejects them, and a stark white skeleton \u2014 referred to as coral bleaching \u2014 is left behind, and the weakened coral is at risk of dying.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost maybe more than 95% of the Elkhorn corals that were on Florida\u2019s reefs at that point,\u201d Baker said.",
      "Some of the corals spawned in the Florida Aquarium's laboratory arrived there in 2020, said Keri O\u2019Neil, director and senior scientist with the aquarium's Coral Conservation Program.",
      "She said more fragments from Honduras and Florida will continue to live at the center.",
      "\u201cWe hope that every year in the future we can make more and more crosses and continue to figure out which parents produce the best offspring,\u201d O'Neil said.",
      "The tiny Elkhorn coral fragments were placed onto small concrete bases along the reef on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve arranged them in a certain way that we can compare the performance of each of corals,\u201d Baker said.",
      "The team will study how the corals that have a Honduran parent compare to the ones that are entirely from Florida.",
      "\"But it\u2019s really the future that we\u2019re looking to and in particular, a warming future and a warming summer, how these corals do and do they have more thermal tolerance than the native Florida population, because that\u2019s really what the goal of the whole project is,'' he said.",
      "Baker said it's the most exciting project he's worked on during his 20-year stint at the University of Miami.",
      "If the corals thrive, it could provide a blueprint for working across the Caribbean to share corals.",
      "\u201cThis is a project about international collaboration, about the fact that our environment really doesn\u2019t have closed borders, that we can work together to make things better in the world,\u201d said Juli Berwald, co-founder of Tela Cora. \u201cAnd it shows that when we talk to each other, when we work together, we can really do something that might be life-changing, not just for us but for the corals and the reefs and all the animals that rely on the reefs.\u201d",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyer says the music mogul got a standing ovation from fellow prisoners when he returned to the federal lockup in Brooklyn after the verdict.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering in his federal trial in New York, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America.",
      "Combs, 55, was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution, but was acquitted on the most serious charges, which carried potential life-in-prison sentences.",
      "\"They all said: 'We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'\" attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after the jury reached its verdict.",
      "The music mogul remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on the prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time served, which currently amounts to almost 10 months.",
      "After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"I said: 'Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'\" he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. \"They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.\"",
      "Blunt trial strategy works",
      "The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.",
      "The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.",
      "\"You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, \"is simply not sex trafficking.\"",
      "Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,\" he said.",
      "Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.",
      "\"No one knows what to think,\" Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.",
      "Morning surprise awakes lawyer",
      "\"I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: \"We have to get a bail application together,\" he recalled. \"It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.\"",
      "He said he \"kind of whipped everybody into feeling better\" after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.",
      "Agnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.",
      "The seemingly chastened Combs mouthed \"thank you\" to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: \"Dream Team! Dream Team!\" Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.",
      "\"This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,\" said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited \"a dream team of defense lawyers\" against prosecutors who almost always win.",
      "Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy \u2014 belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them \u2014 last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the \"federal government comes into our bedrooms,\" he said.",
      "Lawyers gently questioned most witnesses",
      "During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.",
      "Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team \"had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. That's masterful.\"",
      "Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.",
      "\"I knew the weak points in the statute,\" he said. \"The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.\"",
      "He said prosecutors had \"dozens of fail points.\"",
      "\"They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,\" he said. \"They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.\"",
      "Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.",
      "Once freed, Combs likely to reenter domestic abusers program",
      "For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.",
      "\"He's doing OK,\" said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.",
      "He said Combs genuinely desires improvement and \"realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.\"",
      "\"He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune\" that can erase them,\" he said. \"You can't cover them up.\"",
      "For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom.",
      "\"I'm like: 'What the hell?'\" recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures.",
      "Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse.",
      "\"We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. It was crazy. I was worried about him,\" he said.",
      "The man was eventually taken away conscious by rescue workers, leaving Agnifilo to ponder a tumultuous day.",
      "\"It was like I was getting punked by God,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:16:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Fifty years ago, a monumental movie premiered that forever changed Hollywood. Ben Mankiewicz talks with actors Richard Dreyfuss and Lorraine Gary and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb about filming the Steven Spielberg blockbuster.",
    "story": [
      "At a dock on Martha's Vineyard is the Orca, the boat from \"Jaws.\" It's a replica, of course; the original one sank, weighed down by a five-ton man-eating shark. The guy next to the Orca, however, is the real thing. Of this Orca, Richard Dreyfuss said, \"It's too neat, by far.\"",
      "It's been a while since Dreyfuss was on Martha's Vineyard. He says his memories of making \"Jaws\" are great. But back then, he did everything he could not to be in the movie. \"I turned the film down a couple of times because I was thinking that it was gonna be a bitch to shoot. And I was not wrong!\" he laughed. \"But it was such an adventure. And if you had to pick one word to describe the shoot, it was waiting.\"",
      "Now 77, Dreyfuss remembers the standing around, but he also knows \"Jaws,\" made here on the island in the summer of 1974, turned him into a Hollywood star.",
      "I asked, \"Was there ever a moment where you think, 'We're making one of the greatest outdoor films of all time'?\"",
      "\"No,\" Dreyfuss replied. He was convinced that what they were making was obviously a turkey, \"and this thing was gonna crash and burn.\"",
      "The production was a legendary slog. This was the first Hollywood movie to shoot on the unpredictable open seas of the Atlantic. The mechanical shark rarely worked in salt water, and the budget more than doubled.",
      "But Steven Spielberg, a 27-year-old director making his first big studio picture, turned misfortune into opportunity.",
      "\"Jaws\" became one of the most influential American films of the 20th century, and ushered in the summer blockbuster. Set 50 years ago over the July 4th weekend, the plot, says Dreyfuss, is simple: \"This was the story of three guys against this shark. It was this human thing. And we were really good and we knew it. Wow, a kid getting bitten? And if you remember the beginning of the film, you are terrified before you see the shark.\"",
      "Before the shark brought terror to the big screen, it arrived at the bookstore. In 1974, Peter Benchley's novel became a bestseller. Spielberg read it and immediately wanted to direct the movie version \u2013 though he was unhappy with early drafts. So, he asked a friend, screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, to rip it to shreds.",
      "\"Steven sent it to me with a note on the cover that said, 'Eviscerate it!!'\" Gottlieb said.",
      "Gottlieb wrote a lengthy memo, noting, \"If we do our jobs right, people will feel about going in the water the way they felt about taking a shower after 'Psycho.'\"",
      "They did their jobs, all right, led by those three guys: Actor Robert Shaw as Quint, the hunter with a shark-infested backstory; Roy Scheider, the police chief afraid of the water; and Dreyfuss, who changed his mind about making \"Jaws\" after seeing (and hating) his own performance in the film he'd just made, \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.\"",
      "\"I said, 'If I'm not working when this film comes out, I'll never work again,'\" Dreyfuss said. \"And so, I went back to Steven and begged him for the part, and he gave it to me. They had started shooting on April 2; I was cast on the 3rd; my first day of shooting was the 4th; that was the way it all went.\"",
      "Lorraine Gary played Ellen Brody, the police chief's wife. \"I had nothing to lose,\" she said. \"I was getting older. I was 32. That's almost ancient! And it sounded like fun.\"",
      "I asked, \"What about being cast in this sounded like fun to you?\"",
      "\"Going on location to Martha's Vineyard,\" Gary replied. \"I had never been there. Robert Shaw sounded like fun!\"",
      "\"Well, I think I know what that means. But what does that mean?\"",
      "\"You know what it means. And so do you in the audience!\" Gary laughed.",
      "Her experience with Roy Scheider? That was less fun. \"I feel closer to you than I did to the man who played my husband,\" Gary said. \"I think Roy was very protective of his career. I think he was at that point in his career where he hadn't quite made it to being a big-time star. And, perhaps, he thought that I wasn't top drawer enough to be his wife. I never felt a closeness with him. I felt older, and larger. A big head.\"",
      "\"Literally big head?\" I asked.",
      "\"Literally. I mean, he told me, 'Your head is bigger than mine' in the two-shot!\" she laughed.",
      "In addition to writing the script, Gottlieb played newspaperman Harry Meadows. He earned roughly $13,000 for writing and acting in \"Jaws.\" Though he says much of the dark humor was not on the page.",
      "\"We were blessed with a cast that could kind of ad lib in character,\" he said. \"With most actors if you say, 'Ad lib,' it makes their part bigger. But these people were ad libbing relatively selflessly. When I spotted something potentially funny, or if there was humor in something, I would say to Steven, 'I think we got a laugh here if we change the line.'\" And, he said, Spielberg was always responsive to that.",
      "Then there were the delays. As the shooting schedule tripled from 55 days to 159, the actors started to get under each other's skin. Dreyfuss said, \"The thing about Robert Shaw, he knew that he had me psychologically, like, with a little pin through my stomach. And if he said that I couldn't do 25 sit-ups, I couldn't. But I could. And he would say, 'You can't jump off the top of the Orca into the water.' And I couldn't. But I could. He had me!\"",
      "I spoke to Dreyfuss at the Harbor View Hotel, where some of the cast and crew stayed \u2026 and where Oscar-winning editor Verna Fields cut much of the movie. It was also the scene of a \"Jaws\" food fight. Dreyfuss doesn't quite remember who threw the first lobster roll: \"Well, it was either Roy or me.\"",
      "\"Jaws\" surfaced on June 20, 1975. For the first time ever, a movie opened nationwide, and for the first time ever, a movie made more than $100 million.",
      "Asked why it did so well, Gottlieb replied, \"You know, why is the Mona Lisa still a hit? It had that combination of things, any three of which or five of which would've made it a hit. But ['Jaws'] had, like, ten of those.\"",
      "\"Jaws\" changed Hollywood, as well as the lives of everyone associated with it. Steven Spielberg has become the defining director of his generation, and the legacies of Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are forever linked to this film, a movie that millions of us still think about every single time we stroll toward the ocean.",
      "Dreyfuss said, \"I will never walk from the beach into the water so that the water comes up to my chest. If and when that ever happens, I'll either be dead or in a mental institution. The fact that I can't see what's happening underneath is so real to me, I can't do it.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before 'Jaws' and after 'Jaws'?\"",
      "\"Before 'Jaws,\" I didn't care!\" Dreyfuss replied.",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 10:18:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer's latest book delves into the life, complexities and sardonic humor of a man who remains a vital presence in American culture.",
    "story": [
      "The Mississippi Valley is \"as tranquil and reposeful as dreamland, and has nothing this-worldly about it \u2026 nothing to hang a fret or worry upon.\" It's a beautiful sentiment, and yet it contrasts with the fretful and worried life of the man who wrote those words: Samuel Clemens, known to the world by his pen name, Mark Twain.",
      "Twain died 115 years ago, but his books are still being read, and hotly debated, around the globe. It's quite the legacy for a mischievous boy of modest means raised in Hannibal, Missouri, just steps away from the roaring Mississippi. It was, said Jim Waddell, \"the international highway of 1835.\"",
      "Waddell has portrayed Twain for three decades \u2013 a performance always in demand when Hannibal's streets are filled each spring for the Twain on Main festival. It's a good gig that requires of Waddell a clean white suit. \"You keep the suit white by doing no work!\" Waddell laughed.",
      "Korbin Asbury and Ainsley Ahrens competed against other eighth graders in the town to represent the characters Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher in Hannibal. \"I love meeting the new people, 'cause there's 44 different countries that visited Hannibal last year,\" said Asbury.",
      "Asked if she were surprised that an author who lived more than 100 years ago still seems so relevant today, Ahrens replied, \"I am, but not really, because his words that he said, they still work with us today. They're wise words.\"",
      "Wise words, with more than a touch of humor:",
      "\"Always do right. This will gratify some people, and astonish the rest.\"",
      "\"Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.\"",
      "Twain is quoted as having called himself not just an American, but \"the American.\" \"I think that part of the continuing fascination with Mark Twain is that he combines in his person both the best and the worst of our national culture,\" said Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow. He has chronicled the lives of great Americans, perhaps most famously Alexander Hamilton, whose biography spawned the Broadway musical. Chernow's latest book tackles the life of Twain, a figure who has never left the national spotlight.",
      "Twain once wrote, \"Biographies are but the clothes and buttons of the man \u2013 the biography of the man himself cannot be written.\" \"That line was in my head every single day that I worked on this book,\" Chernow laughed. \"I kind of had this image of Mark Twain coming back to life and saying, 'I told you so.'\"",
      "Chernow traces Twain's sardonic humor to the pain in which it was rooted. Although he enjoyed boyhood adventures that would inspire \"Tom Sawyer,\" his father was a failure in business.\u00a0 The fear of poverty, and an anxious pursuit of wealth, would dominate Twain's adult life.",
      "In Hartford, Connecticut, site of Twain's home, Chernow described the sprawling mansion that he had built: \"I see his personality. All the angles and porches and turrets, it's like all of the different sides of his personality. And he always loved conspicuousness, and this is probably the most conspicuous house in the city.\"",
      "I asked, \"Was Mark Twain happy here?\"",
      "\"Not just happy here, it was far and away the happiest 17 years of his life,\" Chernow said. \"It was this idyllic period. He had this large expensive house. He had a rich and gorgeous wife. He had three beautiful and smart daughters. It was really a charmed life.\"",
      "Although Twain became wealthy as a writer and public speaker, he poured his fortune \u2013 and his wife's \u2013 into ill-fated investments. The most notorious was the Paige Compositor, a typesetting machine that Twain was sure would make him millions.",
      "The themes that run through Twain's life and his work \u2013 politics, corruption, money, class, race, get-rich-quick themes \u2013 all seem quite relevant to America today. Chernow said, \"It's a great American story, and I think that there's so many things that he said \u2013 for instance, about politics \u2013 that really resonate today. One line that used to drive him crazy was, 'My country right or wrong.' You know, he said that we should support our country always, and our government when it deserves it.\"",
      "Chernow believes President Trump would be a familiar figure to the humorist, \"to the extent that one of the great stock characters in Mark Twain's fiction is the salesman. You can see it in President Trump. You could see it in so many different figures in American life \u2013 the big talkers, the big shots.\"",
      "It's no small irony that Twain was nothing if not a big shot himself \u2013 a man who craved attention as much as money. But fame also emboldened Twain to speak truth to power, most enduringly through his masterpiece, \"Huckleberry Finn.\"",
      "Chernow said, \"One of the things that I argued in my book was that there was no White author in the late 19th century who engaged more fully, and I think more affectionately, with the Black community than Twain. Now, I had to point out early on, if you read letters that he wrote when he was a teenager, they're full of crude, racist remarks \u2013 and not only about Blacks, seems like just about everybody.\"",
      "By 1884, Twain had published \"Huck Finn,\" which, said Chernow, \"whatever its imperfections, is still, I think, the great anti-slavery novel in the language.\"",
      "For Chernow, Mark Twain is still a vital presence in American life. His words continue to make us think, and almost certainly laugh.",
      "Asked why his works have endured when so many other great authors' books are languishing, Chernow replied, \"I think it's a very, very good question. He likened a fine literature to a wine, and he said, 'My writing is water, but everyone drinks water.'\"",

    "summary": "The feuding Gallagher brothers kicked off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, their first performance since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
    "story": [
      "Oasis ended a 16-year hiatus on Friday with a punchy, powerful trip through one of Britpop's greatest songbooks, kicking off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales to a crowd ecstatic for the band's 1990s hits.",
      "And was there brotherly love between the famously feuding Gallagher siblings? Definitely maybe.",
      "Fans traveled to the Welsh capital from around the world for a show that many thought would never happen. Guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher and his singer brother Liam, the heart of Oasis, had not performed together since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
      "One fan banner summed it up: \"The great wait is over.\"",
      "After a montage of headlines about the sparring siblings was capped with the words \"the guns have fallen silent,\" Oasis appeared on stage to a deafening roar, opening with the apt \"Hello\" and its refrain of \"it's good to be back.\"",
      "The brothers had a brief hand-in-hand moment but largely kept their distance onstage. Noel, 58, focused on his guitar while a parka-clad Liam, 52, snarled into the microphone with a swagger that has not dimmed in the 31 years since the band released its first album, \"Definitely Maybe.\"",
      "A crowd of more than 60,000 in the Principality Stadium was treated to a well-paced two-hour set that drew heavily on the first album and its 1995 followup, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory,\" alongside a smattering of later tracks and fan-favorite B-sides.",
      "Song like \"Supersonic,\" \"Roll With It\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" sounded as thunderous as ever and sparked mass sing-alongs.",
      "\"Put your arms over each other like you love each other,\" a tambourine-clutching Liam exhorted the crowd before launching into \"Cigarettes and Alcohol.\"",
      "There was poignancy on \"Live Forever\" when an image of Liverpool Football Club player Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash on Thursday, was projected above the band.",
      "Noel took his turn on lead vocals for several songs, including the touching \"Half the World Away,\" and the show ended with encores featuring some of Oasis' most enduring tracks: \"Don't Look Back in Anger,\" \"Wonderwall\" and \"Champagne Supernova.\" The brothers shared a half-hug as they ended the final song.",
      "Multicolored, sometimes faintly psychedelic projections formed the main technological accoutrement to a show where the focus was squarely on the songs. There was little banter, though Liam paused between songs to check the audience was having a good time.",
      "\"Was it worth the 40,000 pounds you paid for the ticket?\" he quipped at one point, referring to the scramble for seats that saw some fans pay hundreds to see a show.",
      "From the roar of response, it was.",
      "The show in Cardiff kicked off a 19-date Live '25 tour in the U.K. and Ireland. Then come stops in North America, South America, Asia and Australia, ending in Sao Paulo on Nov. 23.",
      "Before the show, the streets around the stadium filled with fans who gathered in groups to sing along to the band's hits and snapped up Oasis-branded bucket hats at 35 pounds ($48) each.",
      "\"It's very, very special \u2014 emotional,\" said 44-year old Rob Maule from Edinburgh, Scotland. \"I'm here with three of my friends, childhood friends, and we used to see Oasis across the country.",
      "\"For us, it's a generational thing. It's a chapter of our lives,\" he said. \"And then the second generation, as people are taking their kids. It's really special.\"",
      "Vicki Moynehan came from Dorchester, in southwest England. She said her life has changed since she bought her ticket almost a year ago.",
      "\"Seven months pregnant \u2014 ain't gonna stop me,\" she said.",
      "Founded in the working-class streets of Manchester, England, in 1991, Oasis was one of the dominant British acts of the 1990s, releasing eight U.K. No. 1 albums.",
      "The band's sound was fueled by sing-along rock choruses and the combustible chemistry between guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher \u2014 a Beatles and glam rock-loving musician with a knack for memorable tunes \u2014 and younger brother Liam.",
      "Then and since, the brothers have often traded barbs \u2014 onstage, in the studio and in interviews. Liam once called Noel \"tofu boy,\" while Noel branded his brother \"the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup.\"",
      "After a backstage bustup at a concert in France in 2009, they long resisted pressure to reunite, even with the promise of a multimillion-dollar payday.",
      "Now they have agreed on a tour that sees hem joined by former Oasis members Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs and Gem Archer on guitar, bassist Andy Bell and drummer Joey Waronker.",
      "The announcement of the U.K. tour in August sparked a ticket-buying frenzy, complete with error messages, hourslong online queues, dashed hopes and anger at prices that surged at the last minute.",
      "The ticketing troubles sparked questions in U.K. Parliament, where Arts Minister Chris Bryant criticized \"practices that see fans of live events blindsided by price hikes.\" Britain's competition regulator has since threatened Ticketmaster \u2014 which sold around 900,000 Oasis tickets \u2014 with legal action.",
      "No plans have been announced for Oasis to record any new music, and the tour is being presented as a one-off.",
      "Music writer John Aizlewood said that it's an opportunity for Oasis to \"tend the legacy\" of the band, and remind people of the power of the Oasis brand.",
      "\"There should be a sense of huge joy and life affirmation about these shows. And I think if they can just play it right, then that can be a massive burnishing of their legacy,\" he said. \"(There is) this enduring love for Oasis \u2014 and love means money.\"",
      "Fans were determined to enjoy the moment.",
      "\"I'm the oldest sibling of four brothers, so I know they'll fall out,\" said Stephen Truscott, from Middlesbrough in northeast England. \"(But) the first night, they're going to have an absolute unbelievable blast. It's going to be the best.\"",

      "\"MLE [Major League Eating] and Nathan's went to great lengths in recent months to accommodate Joey and his management team, agreeing to the appearance fee and allowing Joey to compete in a rival unbranded hot dog eating contest on Labor Day,\" Major League Eating, which sanctions the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, said in a statement at the time. \"For nearly two decades, we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions. However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different hot dog brand over our longtime relationship.\"",
      "Chestnut ended up competing against his old rival, Takeru Kobayashi, in a hot dog eating competition that streamed on Netflix on Labor Day last year. Chestnut won that contest, which followed the same rules as the Nathan's competition.",
      "Chestnut has agreed to only endorse Nathan's hot dogs going forward, so he was allowed to return this year.",
      "Who is expected to win the hot dog eating contest?",
      "Chestnut and Sudo are far and away the favorites to win the men's and women's contests, respectively. Chestnut comes in at an enormous -2000 favorite. Bertoletti is +1200, but comes in at +155 in the Winner Without Chestnut market, according to CBS Sports.",
      "Many sportsbooks aren't even offering odds on the women's side due to Sudo's dominance, according to CBS Sports. However, betting expert Matt Severance told CBS Sports the Under 45.5 for Sudo at -105 could be a worthwhile wager.",
      "Check out CBS Sports for a more detailed breakdown of the hot dog eating contest's odds and predictions.",
      "What is the record amount of hot dogs eaten at a hot dog eating contest?",
      "Chestnut holds both the official and unofficial world records for most hot dogs eaten in a competition. He downed 83 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes during his Labor Day competition against Kobayashi, but since that event wasn't sanctioned by Major League Eating, it's not considered official.",
      "The official world record is 76, also set by Chestnut during the 2021 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.",
      "What are the rules for Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest?",
      "The rules for the hot dog eating contest are fairly simple. Competitors have 10 minutes to eat as many hot dogs and buns as possible. They can break the hot dogs up with their hands and separate them from the buns, but the entire thing, hot dog and bun, has to be swallowed for it to count.",

    "story": [
      "Michael Madsen, the actor known for appearances in several Quentin Tarantino films, including \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" and \"The Hateful Eight,\" has died, his manager told CBS News.\u00a0He was 67.",
      "Madsen apparently went into cardiac arrest and was found unresponsive in his home in Malibu, California, on Thursday morning, manager Ron Smith said.",
      "\"In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films Resurrection Road, Concessions and Cookbook for Southern Housewives, and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life,\" managers Susan Ferris and Ron Smith and publicist Liz Rodriguez said in a statement.",
      "\"Michael was also preparing to release a new book called Tears For My Father: Outlaw Thoughts and Poems currently being edited. Michael Madsen was one of Hollywood's most iconic actors, who will be missed by many,\" they added.",
      "Originally from Chicago, Madsen appeared in more than 300 movies and TV shows throughout his more than four decades in Hollywood, according to IMDB.",
      "He began his career at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater.",
      "\"I am heartbroken to hear of the passing of old friend Mike Madsen,\" Steppenwolf co-founder Terry Kinney said in a statement. \"Although I knew him years ago, it was very memorable, as he acted in a production of 'Of Mice and Men' which I directed. Michael was a car mechanic when we started rehearsals. He wrote long handwritten letters to me for years about how art saved his life. He was wonderful in that production and you could see his future success from the outset. He will be missed.\"",
      "He is perhaps best known for his role as Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and the iconic scene in which he tortures a police officer while the 1973 Stealers Wheel hit \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" plays in the background.",
      "While usually not playing the lead role, his unmistakable gruff voice made him a memorable presence in smaller roles and even bit parts in films like \"Sin City,\" \"Donnie Brasco\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"",
      "Madsen has also published several collections of poetry, including \"Burning in Paradise\" and \"Expecting Rain.\"",
      "\"His work reflects the same gritty realism and emotional undercurrent that defines his acting,\" his representatives said in a statement. \"In addition to acting and writing, he is an accomplished photographer and has produced a number of independent projects.\"",
      "During a speech at his handprint ceremony at Los Angeles' famous TCL Chinese Theatre in 2020, Madsen reflected, \"I could have been a bricklayer. I could have been an architect. I could have been a garbageman. I could have been nothing. But I got lucky. I got lucky as an actor.\"",
      "Madsen also referenced \"mistakes\" he had made in his life during that speech, which was mainly addressed to his wife, DeAnna Morgan. Madsen pleaded no contest to a DUI charge in 2019, which had come within 10 years of another DUI charge. He was sentenced to four days in jail and five years probation, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "He received a $500 citation for a misdemeanor after allegedly trespassing on a property in 2022, People reported at the time, which came just a month after his son, Hudson, died by suicide at 26. Two years later, he was arrested on a charge of misdemeanor domestic battery and later released after what his representative said was a \"disagreement between Michael and his wife,\" People reported.",
      "Madsen and Morgan had two other sons, Calvin and Luke. Madsen had two other sons from a previous marriage to Jeannine Bisignano, Max and Christian, both of whom are also actors.",

      "Red Panda \u2014 whose real name is Rong Niu \u2014 spent 11 hours in a Minneapolis hospital, with a pair of Lynx staffers there with her the entire time, agent Patrick Figley said. The Chinese American acrobat was heading home for treatment and recovery, which should take a few months.",
      "\"She is very grateful,\" Figley said. \"Red Panda thanks everyone for all the kind wishes and support. It means the world to her.\"",

    "summary": "The verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial comes after the high-profile proceedings started in May.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his federal trial in New York City, but the music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Combs will remain in detention while he awaits his sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years.",
      "How did Sean \"Diddy\" Combs react to the verdict?",
      "As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura \u2014 the R&B singer known as Cassie \u2014 Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples.",
      "When he heard the word \"guilty\" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then \"not guilty\" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her.",
      "Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed \"thank you\" to attorney Marc Agnifilo.",
      "Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: \"I'm coming home.\"",
      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained.",
      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",
      "Jericka  Duncan and \n                                                  \n                      The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "\"We are not nearly done fighting,\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told reporters outside U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan. \"Today was a major, major step in the right direction, but we fight on and we're gonna win, and we're not gonna stop until he walks out of prison a free man to his family.\"",
      "Prosecutors previously said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years. They told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",
      "Combs has also shown no remorse or regret in abusing his ex-girlfriend \"Jane,\" the prosecution said, adding that the defense's suggestion that Combs slapping Jane while she was in the shower was in self-defense is \"insulting.\"",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving Jane. He was also accused of sex trafficking Jane by force, fraud or coercion, a charge the jury found him not guilty of.",
      "Jane had told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. She testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Combs had drugs and supplies for another act of prostitution in the New York hotel where he stayed \u2014 and also invited Jane to come \u2014 before he was arrested.",
      "Following the seven-week jury trial, Combs' attorneys moved to have him released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he has been held during the trial. They argued that the 55-year-old had been acquitted of the most serious charges and that \"continued detention of Mr. Combs is inappropriate.\"",
      "\"He is a man who's in the process of working on himself. He's been a model prisoner,\" Combs' lawyer told the judge. \"I just think we should trust him\" that he's not going to flee, the defense said.",
      "The defense said Combs should be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. In a filing submitted to the judge on Wednesday, Combs' legal team said he came to New York to surrender because he was \"committed to showing his innocence\" and that Combs should be released pending sentencing.",

      "Federal prosecutors, however, argued that the Bail Reform Act dictates that Combs should remain in custody.",

      "The panel of eight men and four women entered the third day of deliberations at U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan, having arrived at a decision Tuesday on two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, the latter concerning allegations of arranging to fly women and sex workers across state lines.",
      "It remains unclear whether the jury found Combs guilty or not guilty of those four counts. Before the results of the verdict can be announced, jurors will have to decide on count 1 of racketeering conspiracy.",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0all the charges.",
      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1. The foreman told Judge Arun Subramanian that the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the racketeering conspiracy charge because they had jurors \"with unpersuadable opinions on both sides.\" The judge told them to keep deliberating, and the jurors were later dismissed for the day.",
      "According to the jury's verdict sheet, there are eight acts under the federal racketeering conspiracy charge: kidnapping, arson, bribery, witness tampering, forced labor, sex trafficking, transportation and inducement to travel for purposes of prostitution, and possession with intent to distribute narcotics.",

    "summary": "The partial verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial came on the second day of deliberations. The jury will return to deliberate on the final count Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was convicted of prostitution-related offenses but acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges on Wednesday, July 2. Read the story here. Our earlier coverage is below.",
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial in New York City said it reached a partial verdict in the case, but the judge told them they need to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1, racketeering conspiracy. The note indicated there are jurors with unpersuadable opinions on that charge.",
      "After discussing the options with attorneys for both sides, Judge Arun Subramanian asked the jury to keep deliberating on the remaining charge, which is what prosecutors and defense attorneys asked for.",
      "Court then ended for the day. The jury will return to continue deliberations at 9 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "After the note from the jury was brought to court, Combs was seated with his attorneys surrounding him, standing in a half-circle. Combs appeared to be praying with his head bowed and hands folded on his lap. Combs wiped and rubbed his eyes, but it wasn't clear if he was crying.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday.",
      "What are the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "A sweeping grand jury indictment against Combs, 55, was unsealed in September 2024, initially charging the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at an upscale midtown Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges against Combs in a superseding indictment, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "The charges against Combs are one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs' attorneys didn't call him or any witnesses to testify in his defense during the trial. Combs told Judge Subramanian that he decided not to testify, saying: \"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it.\" His lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Combs, and the defense sought an acquittal after the prosecution rested.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" and \"hotel nights\"",
      "The high-profile trial started in May. The proceedings included graphic and emotional testimony, including from singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend who spent more than a decade with him.",
      "Ventura testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura said in court that Combs directed all the encounters, which could last for days. She said Combs would decide who participated, what she could wear and the role she was expected to play. She testified that she felt forced to participate in the \"freak-offs\" to make Combs happy.",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual, and during cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Last year, CNN aired surveillance video from 2016 showing what appears to be Combs assaulting Ventura at a California hotel. Combs apologized at the time, and said his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions. Ventura testified during the trial that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly settled with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Singer Dawn Richard, who was part of two bands tied to Combs, testified that she often saw Combs being violent toward Ventura. She said that after one incident in 2009, Combs allegedly threatened her and a bandmate, saying they could go missing if they didn't stay quiet.",
      "The defense focused on inconsistencies in Richard's testimony, and she said it takes time to remember things she tried to forget. Separately, Richard has made allegations against Combs in a civil lawsuit, accusing him of physical and psychological abuse, which he has denied.",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym Jane in court. During their relationship between 2021 and 2024, she told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched.",
      "She said she told Combs she didn't like the \"hotel nights.\" Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting them up. Jane said she felt pressured to meet her partner's expectations and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "Jane said she got into a fight with Combs last year over another woman. She said she slammed his head on a marble table and he allegedly grabbed her by the neck, punched and kicked her.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial wanted to review some of the testimony from the hip-hop mogul's former longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura during the second day of deliberations Tuesday.",
      "The panel of eight men and four women continued deliberating the charges against Combs after not reaching a verdict on the first day of deliberations.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian began the day by addressing with the prosecution and defense a question posed Monday from the jury about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 which relates to the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The jury sent a note asking for clarification on the part of the instructions addressing drug distribution.",
      "Subramanian said he would remind jurors of the instructions he gave them on that part of the case before they started deliberating on Monday. Combs' lawyers had pushed for a more expansive response, but prosecutors argued \u2014 and Subramanian agreed \u2014 that doing so could end up confusing jurors more.",
      "An exchange between Subramanian and Combs' defense team got a little testy as they wrangled over the response.",
      "\"Can you do what I'm asking or no?\" the judge asked.",
      "\"Of course I can do what your honor is asking,\" one of the defense lawyers responded.",
      "About 75 minutes into Tuesday's deliberations, the jury requested the testimony from Ventura, one of the prosecution's most important witnesses, when she gave her account of Combs allegedly beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 \u2014 an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage. Combs apologized after the video surfaced.",
      "The jury also asked to see Ventura's testimony about an incident in which she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off of their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.",
      "In addition, the jury asked for Ventura and stripper Daniel Phillip's testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel after, as Phillip testified, he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.",
      "\"Her whole entire body was shaking, like she was terrified,\" said Phillip, who was at the hotel for a sexual encounter with Ventura sometime between 2012 and 2014.",
      "Phillip testified that he asked Ventura why she was with Combs if he was hitting her and beating her. He said he told her she was in real danger. Ventura, he said, \"basically tried to convince me that it was OK, it's OK. I'm fine, I'll be OK.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0federal charges\u00a0of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "The first day of deliberations saw several notes from the jury, as well as Combs and his supporters bowing their heads in prayer in the courtroom. One of the notes came not long after jurors started deliberating and raised concerns from several jurors about another member of the panel. They told the judge they thought \"he cannot follow your honor's instructions.\"",
      "After a discussion between the judge, attorneys for Combs and prosecutors, the judge reminded the jurors of their obligation to follow the law and sent them back to resume their deliberations, but said if more issues should arise, the foreperson should send another note.",
      "To help them come to a verdict, jurors were provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Five alternate jurors\u00a0are also on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury.",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of at times\u00a0graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\" Defense lawyers argued that there was no conspiracy and that his conduct did not violate federal laws.",

    "story": [
      "Former NFL player Corey Parchman appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday to discuss his new book \"IVF Playbook for Men,\" sharing his personal experience with infertility and advocating for greater awareness of male fertility issues.",
      "Parchman, now a real estate developer, wrote the book after struggling to find resources for men going through infertility treatments. At least 30% of infertility cases are related to male factors, yet men are less likely to discuss the issue or seek support.",
      "\"As I went through the process, there was nothing out there for men that were going through the process,\" Parchman said. \"There's a ton of information for women, and it should be, because women carry 99% of the load ... So I wanted to create this book as a resource for men.\"",
      "Parchman and his wife, Elisha, endured five IVF cycles over two-and-a-half years, including multiple miscarriages, before welcoming their son. He described receiving the initial diagnosis of male factor infertility as shocking.",
      "\"I asked the doctor to do a recheck. You're not talking about me, are you?\" Parchman recalled. \"It's a shock because as you grow up you think this is the process of having kids. It's as simple as ABC.'\"",
      "The former athlete said he felt like he was being \"the weakest link on the team,\" and worried he had let his partner down. Throughout the process, he struggled with feeling sidelined during a time when he wanted to be actively involved.",
      "\"I'm a person that's a fixer. I fix things. This situation I had to sit back and put the faith in my doctors and my wife,\" he explained. \"Once you get out of your own way and realize it's not about you, it's about your family, the process becomes easier.\"",
      "Parchman said there's an importance of open communication between partners during fertility treatments. He and his wife created what he called a \"safe space\" where they could express their feelings without judgment.",
      "The book also addresses how to handle well-meaning but often misguided advice from friends and family. Parchman advised giving people grace while recognizing that their suggestions may not be helpful.",
      "\"I had friends tell me, 'Eat three eggs and spin around and jump,'\" he said. \"Thanks for the advice, but I'm listening to the doctors.\"",
      "Beyond becoming a father, Parchman said the IVF journey transformed his understanding of masculinity. He now advocates for men to be more vulnerable and open about their struggles.",

    "story": [
      "The White House is set to put pressure on the U.S.'s trading partners this week to sign new tariff deals, with the hope that they will be finalized before a Wednesday deadline.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to send dozens of letters to countries that have not made a trade deal, warning them that higher tariffs could kick in Aug. 1, White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday.",
      "\"Our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners,\"\u00a0Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0\"And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.\"",
      "As many as 15 letters will be going out beginning Monday, President Trump confirmed to reporters before heading back to the White House from his New Jersey club on Sunday. Some will go out on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said, adding that \"some deals have been made.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wrote later on social media that \"Letters, and/or Deals, with various Countries from around the World\" would start being delivered at 12:00 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "\"Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff,\" Mr. Trump wrote in another post, referring to an alliance of nations with emerging economies, which held a summit in Brazil over the weekend. \"There will be no exceptions to this policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "Initially comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the group now also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Mr. Trump did not specify what exactly would trigger the added BRICS tariff.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also told reporters Sunday that higher tariffs could go into effect Aug. 1 for countries that don't make a deal by Wednesday.",
      "Questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether Mr. Trump will once more push off imposing the rates.",
      "In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Bessent said about 100 letters will be sent to small countries \"where we don't have very much trade\" and where tariffs are already at the baseline of 10%. The treasury secretary also said that the administration is primarily focused on nations with the largest trade deficit with the U.S.",
      "\"There are 18 important trading relationships that account for 95% of our deficit, and those are the ones we're concentrating on,\" Bessent said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was a new deadline and declined to say what might happen Wednesday.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Bessent said on CNN's State of the Union. \"I'm not going to give away the playbook.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers say he could extend the time for dealmaking but they insist the administration is applying maximum pressure on other nations. Hassett said that Trump would decide when it was time to give up on negotiations.",
      "Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, likewise said countries negotiating in good faith and making concessions could \"sort of, get the date rolled.\"",
      "The\u00a0steeper tariffs\u00a0that Trump announced April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "With the freeze on\u00a0sweeping U.S. tariffs\u00a0set to expire Wednesday, July 9, the White House\u00a0has touted new trade agreements with countries in recent weeks, like China, the U.K. and Vietnam.\u00a0But there are still questions heading into the week with other deals yet to be announced.",
      "Bessent said the U.S. was \"close to several deals,\" and predicted several big announcements over the next few days. He gave no details.",
      "\"I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent said.",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS News' MoneyWatch.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced a deal with Vietnam. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. would levy 20% tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam, and a 40% tariff on \"any transshipping.\" The president said Vietnam would \"'OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,' meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.\"",
      "That was a decline from the 46% tax on Vietnamese imports he proposed in April \u2014 one of his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting dozens of countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit.",
      "Asked if he expected to reach deals with the\u00a0European Union\u00a0or India, Trump said Friday that \"letters are better for us\" because there are so many countries involved.",
      "\"We have India coming up and with Vietnam, we did it, but much easier to send a letter saying, 'Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And this is what you're going to have to pay if you want to do business in the United States.\"",
      "Canada, however, will not be one of the countries receiving letters, Trump's ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, said Friday after trade talks between the two countries recently resumed.",
      "\"Canada is one of our biggest trading partners,\" Hoekstra told CTV News in an interview in Ottawa. \"We're going to have a deal that's articulated.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he wants a new deal in place by July 21 or Canada will increase trade countermeasures.",

      "The president on April 2 unveiled a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "Hassett said Sunday that there are a \"whole number\" of deals that U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments, along with letters to be sent to countries where \"deals aren't advanced enough\" this week. Mr. Trump told reporters Friday that the U.S. will start sending letters Monday to around a dozen countries.",
      "Though Hassett wouldn't share any details about the countries set to receive the letters, he said the notices could go to both small and large trading partners.

      "Asked by senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang whether the president will extend the pause for some of the most important trading partners if deals don't come together by Wednesday, Hassett said \"the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world.\"",
      "\"There are deadlines, and there are things that are close, and so maybe things will push back past the deadline, or maybe they won't,\" Hassett said. \"In the end, the president's going to make that judgment.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday that he would likely start the tariffs on Aug. 1.

      "Hassett touted the trade strategy Sunday, saying \"people are responding to President Trump's potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the U.S., which is creating jobs.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and people who benefit the most are the richest people,\" Kogan added.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 15:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP tax and spending bill creates a tax deduction for workers in tipped occupations. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips will become a reality Friday when he signs the\u00a0massive budget package\u00a0into law.",
      "After narrowly squeaking through the House\u00a0on Thursday, the \"big, beautiful bill\" now heads to the president's desk for his signature. As part of the legislation, workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, will see relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How does \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill creates a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who benefits?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all will necessarily benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants could\u00a0qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees might not\u00a0despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that the the U.S. is likely to start informing some countries on Friday what tariffs their exports will face. Earlier in the week, he said doesn't plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff\u00a0pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Countries that fail to come to terms with the Trump administration face potentially large tariff increases. For example, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit EU members with a 50% flat tariff.",
      "\"If this happens, the EU will likely feel compelled to respond in kind, potentially sparking a full trade war and market instability,\" analysts with investment adviser Gavekal said in a report.",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

      "Salt Lake City will be hosting a drone show for the third year in a row. Andrew Wittenberg, a spokesperson for the city's mayor's office, said the main reason for adopting the new Fourth of July display was safety. Drone shows reduce the risk of fires and are touted as a more environmentally friendly option than fireworks which can leave behind debris.",

      "Drone shows are also far much quieter than fireworks, making them more inclusive for people with PTSD and dogs, Jana Cunningham, a communications manager at the Salt Lake City Public Lands Department, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The city expects some 7,500 people for this year's show, which will include the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, among other iconic American images, she said.",
      "That said, drone shows are not accident-proof. Last year, a 7-year-old boy suffered severe injuries after a\u00a0drone crashed and fell\u00a0onto his head during a holiday light show in Florida. The incident prompted New York Road Runners to cancel a drone show it had planned for its annual New Year's Eve run in Central Park.",
      "Read on for more details about drone shows and what ignited their popularity.",
      "How do drone shows work?",
      "Drone shows use the remotely controlled mini-aircrafts to create patterns and animated scenes in the night sky. In the case of Sky Elements Drones \u2014 a big player in the industry for movie events (Marvel, Star Wars), sports events (Seattle SeaHawks half-time show) and more \u2014 the displays can involve thousands of drones and span up to 400-feet high and 400-feet wide.",
      "To produce the shows, Rick Boss, CEO of Sky Elements, said that his design team works with clients to create storyboards, and then programs the drones to get them ready for flight.",
      "\"A 300-drone show might take as much as 80 hours of programming just to make sure every drone knows exactly where it's supposed to be, what color it's supposed to be, throughout its flight path,\" Boss said.",
      "During the drone show performance, Sky Elements has a pilot and co-pilot monitoring a computer to make sure everything is running smoothly. Drones are programmed to stay within a \"geofence,\" Boss said, which sets limits on where the devices can fly and turns off their motors if they fly outside the boundaries.",
      "Some cities, like Nashville,Tennessee, have opted to combine drones with traditional firework displays as a way of\u00a0 increasing the wow factor. This year, the capital city is incorporating 400 drones into its Independence Day show.",
      "Sky Elements said it also has permits to load its drone shows with traditional pyrotechinics, giving them the ability to shoot off fireworks directly.",
      "Growing business",
      "Drone shows have exploded in popularity in recent years as Americans search for safer and more environmentally friendly ways to mark major events. Among the biggest adopters are\u00a0Major League Baseball and the Grammy Awards.",
      "Industry revenue is around $338 million, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy think tank.",
      "Drone shows started to appear pre-pandemic and really picked up around four years ago, according to Boss. \"The demand has just gone through the roof,\" he said.",
      "In fact, the only thing stopping Sky Elements from hosting more shows is a lack of supply, he added. The company has a fleet of 7,000, which may sound like a lot, but is still not nearly enough to keep up with demand. The company's Fourth of July shows are already sold for next year, he said.",
      "\"Bringing back the boom!\"",
      "Not all places are not ready to break up with traditional firework displays quite yet.",
      "Tahoe City and Kings Beach, which both border Lake Tahoe in California, introduced drone displays two years ago, but are now reversing course this year amid pushback from residents. Kristen Guinn, marketing director of a nonprofit group called North Tahoe Community Alliance, said the two towns made the call after a community survey found that 80% of respondents wanted regular fireworks back.",
      "\"After two years of doing a drone show for Fourth of July festivities, the community has spoken loud and clear \u2014 and the Tahoe City Downtown Association is bringing back the boom!\" reads a statement\u00a0on the group's website.",
      "Galveston, Texas, also returned to traditional fireworks in 2023 after switching to drones in 2022, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June, with the labor market remaining resilient despite slowing economic growth this year. That figure is in line with the average monthly gain of 146,000 over the last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger\u00a0than expected in June. Payroll gains sailed past the 115,000 predicted by economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May and the lowest since February. The jobless rate came in below economist forecasts of 4.3%, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "June's employment data shows that the labor market remains solid even amid significant uncertainty over U.S. trade and fiscal policy. The upshot is that employers continued to add jobs at a steady pace.",
      "Government employment rose the most in June with 73,000 jobs added, driven by gains in the state and local government education sectors. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 7,000 lost in June. Massive cuts in federal jobs by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, earlier this year have gutted several key agencies. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says DOGE layoffs have accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",
      "The health care sector added 39,000 jobs.",
      "The Labor Department also revised up its numbers for April and May by a collective 16,000, a further indication the job market remains on solid ground.",
      "While the labor market remains sturdy, economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Federal Chair Jerome Powell has\u00a0said tariffs could start to hobble economic activity and drive up inflation this summer. At a gathering of central bankers in Portugal earlier this week, Powell said\u00a0the Fed has held off lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "What the experts are saying",
      "Economists underlined that the labor market continues to persevere despite considerable economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Today's stronger jobs report confirms a still resilient U.S. labor market, defying, at least for now, the signs of weakness seen in some leading indicators,\" Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a research note.",
      "The healthy level of job growth likely means the Fed will hold off cutting rates at its meeting this month, experts say. At its most recent meeting, the central bank penciled in two rate cuts by year-end, although some economists predict just one.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks U.S. inflation stemming from tariffs is likely to peak by the fourth quarter, giving the Fed room to lower rates in December to propel economic growth.",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 16:30:30 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by Congress on Thursday pulls the plug on federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "The massive tax and spending cut bill that Congress passed Thursday ends federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
      "Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.",
      "Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.",
      "According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.",
      "Pricier EVs",
      "Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.",
      "\"That's really disappointing because ... they're just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,\" Malmgren said.",
      "The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.",
      "That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.",
      "\"Quickly you'll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,\" Malmgren said.",
      "Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver's savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiplecalculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.",
      "How much you save",
      "A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas.",
      "Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car's purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.",
      "Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long-term is still less polluting than a gas car.",
      "Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) \u2014 slightly more than the average American drives in a year \u2014 the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation.",
      "Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car's life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Cleaner machine",
      "So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.",
      "\"They are a no-brainer,\" Slowik said. \"Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.\"",
      "A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.",
      "Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.",
      "\"If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that's already four to five times more efficient,\" Slowik said.",

    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

      "Microsoft on Wednesday announced it would cut just under 4% of its workforce, or roughly 9,000 employees, in what is a second major round of layoffs this year for the profitable tech giant.",
      "While the economy remains solid by most measures, economists warn that growth could cool in the coming months as the effects of the Trump administration's tariff policies take hold.",
      "DOGE effect",
      "Challenger, Gray & Christmas point to several reasons layoffs are on the rise. The leading factor is DOGE, which the firm said has accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",
      "Firings by the task force led to a spike in federal worker cuts earlier this year at the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, USAID\u00a0and other agencies.\u00a0Thousands also departed through a deferred resignation program.",
      "States in the East and Southeast have seen the biggest jump in layoffs, with a more than 220% jump from a year ago, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "\"This dramatic rise is largely due to significant reductions at federal agencies headquartered in Washington, D.C.,\" the firm said in its report.",
      "DOGE's activities also affected employees in other states and industries that benefit from government funding, including nonprofit groups. So far this year, nonprofit organizations have announced roughly 17,000 job cuts, up 407% from the same period last year, the new data shows.",
      "Tariff hit",
      "An economic slowdown and rocky financial markets has led companies to shed more than 154,000 jobs this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have eliminated nearly 80,000 jobs this year, up 255% from the first half of 2024.",
      "\"Retailers are one of the hardest hit business sectors by tariffs, inflation and uncertainty,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. \"If consumer spending continues to fall, it could mean more job losses in this industry.\"",
      "Challenger Gray directly attributes 2,000 layoffs so far this year to stepped-up U.S. tariffs on foreign imports. Other factors the contributing to the wave of layoffs include store closings and company restructuring efforts.\u00a0Del Monte, At Home and 23andMe are among the companies that have filed for bankruptcy this year.",
      "Although layoffs have jumped, the nation's unemployment rate remains historically low at 4.2% and hiring has remained steady.

      "Small businesses facing higher import costs because of steeper U.S. tariffs are having to find different ways of handling the added expense.",
      "Facing hefty tariffs on parts shipped from China, one small business owner took the hit by redeeming over 1.8 million reward points on his American Express card. Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, a roughly 33-person guitar pedal company in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told CBS MoneyWatch he used the points, rather than cash, to cover the tariffs.",
      "That unusual approach, first reported by Bloomberg, highlights the challenges many smaller enterprises are facing in coping with higher import duties.",
      "Keeley's operation makes pedals used to create effects for electric and some acoustic guitars in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse in Oklahoma. But he's been unable to source one of the pedals' key components, a so-called potentiometer from anywhere other than China, leading to ballooning tariff charges.",
      "\"We manufacture and build nearly every part of the pedals in our factory, including the aluminum enclosures and all the circuit boards,\" Keeley told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I really love manufacturing and giving someone a job.\"",
      "Keeley said his team has tried to find a provider of potentiometers, which control voltages, outside of China, but to no avail.",

      "$11,000 credit card bill",
      "Tariffs on the key component have surged since the start of President Trump's second term in January, according to Keeley. His business was on the hook for tariffs of 25% until March, when the duties temporarily shot up to more than 100%. Now the company pays a rate of 55% for potentiometers, he said.",
      "A 90-day freeze on country-based tariffs, including those in place on China, expires on July 9. Keeley is hoping the current rate will come down, but uncertainty lingers. Trade experts also say Mr. Trump could again extend the tariff pause if trade deals are not reached by the deadline.",
      "Keeley's most recent credit card bill, which included shipping and tariff fees, totaled nearly $11,000, according to a copy of the statement viewed by CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of paying cash, Keeley used the credit card points he'd accrued by paying previous tariff charges with plastic.",
      "\"I decided to use my points because I wasn't redeeming them for other things like gift cards. So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",

He took issue with CBS News airing two different portions of Harris' response to a question about the Middle East, one in an early excerpt on \"Face the Nation\" and the other on the full broadcast of \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee, and it was based on a state consumer protection law that is intended to prevent advertisers from misleading the public about a product being sold. CBS News is not headquartered in Texas, nor did the interview take place there.",
      "He initially sought $10 billion in damages when he filed suit last October but upped his demand to $20 billion in February after adding a federal claim alleging false advertising and unfair competition. Jackson, a Texas Republican, joined Mr. Trump as a plaintiff in the amended complaint.",
      "Paramount has maintained that the lawsuit was completely without merit and that \"60 Minutes\" followed a standard editing process. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, stood behind the show's interview and said he would not apologize. He announced in April that he would depart the network, citing a loss of editorial independence.",

The day after McMahon announced her departure, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone raising concerns that efforts to settle with Mr. Trump would amount to bribery. Redstone had recused herself from settlement talks.",
      "In an April Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said he was \"honored\" to be suing CBS and Paramount. He also urged Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to \"impose the maximum fines and punishment\" against CBS in connection with a news distortion complaint, which was filed by a conservative group over the same Harris interview. Outgoing FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed the complaint in January before former President Biden's term ended, but Carr reopened it days after Mr. Trump took office and appointed him to the role.",
      "Back in February, CBS complied with an FCC inquiry to hand over the transcript and videos from the Harris interview, simultaneously releasing those files to the public.",
      "CBS sought dismissal of the FCC complaint in a March filing, writing, \"The Complaint filed against CBS for 'news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor \u2014 one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.\"",
      "The news distortion complaint remains open and under investigation.",

Carr said Thursday that the FCC was still reviewing the transaction.",

    "story": [
      "The White House is set to put pressure on the U.S.'s trading partners this week to sign new tariff deals, with the hope that they will be finalized before a Wednesday deadline.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to send dozens of letters to countries that have not made a trade deal, warning them that higher tariffs could kick in Aug. 1, White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday.",
      "\"Our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners,\"\u00a0Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0\"And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.\"",
      "As many as 15 letters will be going out beginning Monday, President Trump confirmed to reporters before heading back to the White House from his New Jersey club on Sunday. Some will go out on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said, adding that \"some deals have been made.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wrote later on social media that \"Letters, and/or Deals, with various Countries from around the World\" would start being delivered at 12:00 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "\"Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff,\" Mr. Trump wrote in another post, referring to an alliance of nations with emerging economies, which held a summit in Brazil over the weekend. \"There will be no exceptions to this policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "Initially comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the group now also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Mr. Trump did not specify what exactly would trigger the added BRICS tariff.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also told reporters Sunday that higher tariffs could go into effect Aug. 1 for countries that don't make a deal by Wednesday.",
      "Questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether Mr. Trump will once more push off imposing the rates.",
      "In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Bessent said about 100 letters will be sent to small countries \"where we don't have very much trade\" and where tariffs are already at the baseline of 10%. The treasury secretary also said that the administration is primarily focused on nations with the largest trade deficit with the U.S.",
      "\"There are 18 important trading relationships that account for 95% of our deficit, and those are the ones we're concentrating on,\" Bessent said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was a new deadline and declined to say what might happen Wednesday.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Bessent said on CNN's State of the Union. \"I'm not going to give away the playbook.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers say he could extend the time for dealmaking but they insist the administration is applying maximum pressure on other nations. Hassett said that Trump would decide when it was time to give up on negotiations.",
      "Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, likewise said countries negotiating in good faith and making concessions could \"sort of, get the date rolled.\"",
      "The\u00a0steeper tariffs\u00a0that Trump announced April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "With the freeze on\u00a0sweeping U.S. tariffs\u00a0set to expire Wednesday, July 9, the White House\u00a0has touted new trade agreements with countries in recent weeks, like China, the U.K. and Vietnam.\u00a0But there are still questions heading into the week with other deals yet to be announced.",
      "Bessent said the U.S. was \"close to several deals,\" and predicted several big announcements over the next few days. He gave no details.",
      "\"I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent said.",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS News' MoneyWatch.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced a deal with Vietnam. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. would levy 20% tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam, and a 40% tariff on \"any transshipping.\" The president said Vietnam would \"'OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,' meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.\"",
      "That was a decline from the 46% tax on Vietnamese imports he proposed in April \u2014 one of his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting dozens of countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit.",
      "Asked if he expected to reach deals with the\u00a0European Union\u00a0or India, Trump said Friday that \"letters are better for us\" because there are so many countries involved.",
      "\"We have India coming up and with Vietnam, we did it, but much easier to send a letter saying, 'Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And this is what you're going to have to pay if you want to do business in the United States.\"",
      "Canada, however, will not be one of the countries receiving letters, Trump's ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, said Friday after trade talks between the two countries recently resumed.",
      "\"Canada is one of our biggest trading partners,\" Hoekstra told CTV News in an interview in Ottawa. \"We're going to have a deal that's articulated.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he wants a new deal in place by July 21 or Canada will increase trade countermeasures.",
      "Hoekstra would not commit to a date for a trade agreement and said even with a deal, Canada could still face some tariffs. But \"we're not going to send Canada just a letter,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight EST on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it deported a group of eight men convicted of serious crimes in the United States to the conflict-ridden African country of South Sudan, following a legal saga that had kept the deportees stuck in a military base in Djibouti for weeks.",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight Eastern time on Friday. A photo provided by the department showed the deportees, with their hands and feet shackled, sitting inside an aircraft, guarded by U.S. service members.",
      "The deportations to South Sudan \u2014 a country plagued by armed conflict and political instability that the U.S. government warns Americans not to visit \u2014 mark an unprecedented new frontier in President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "None of the deportees is from South Sudan. They hail from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, and were ordered deported from the U.S. after being convicted of crimes, including murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "The high-profile legal battle over the fate of the men culminated when two federal judges on Friday denied a last-ditch attempt by immigration rights advocates to halt the deportations, saying their hands were tied by recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The deportations signify a major political victory for the Trump administration, which has sought to convince countries around the world \u2014 irrespective of their human rights record \u2014 to accept deportees who are not their citizens, including those convicted of serious crimes.",
      "\"A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman. \"This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "The deportations have also alarmed human rights advocates, who fear the men could face jail time, torture or other harms in South Sudan. They've argued the deportations to South Sudan are designed to punish the men for their crimes, even though they have already served criminal sentences in the U.S.",
      "\"The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process,\" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which tried to halt the deportations. \"Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how the deportees will be treated in South Sudan. A Justice Department attorney told a federal judge Friday that South Sudan informed the U.S. it would offer the men a temporary immigration status, but the lawyer could not confirm whether they would be detained. The Trump administration has said in court filings that South Sudanese officials have made assurances that the deportees will not face torture.",
      "The men's deportation was made possible by a Supreme Court order earlier this week. At the request of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Thursday clarified the scope of an earlier order it had issued to pause a lower court ruling barring deportations to third-party countries without a degree of due process and notice.",
      "That April lower court ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts had required the Trump administration to give detainees sufficient notice and a chance to be interviewed by a U.S. asylum officer before any deportation to a country where they did not hail from. That case thwarted several deportation efforts, including a plan to send detainees to Libya.",
      "When he learned of the administration's plan to deport the eight men to South Sudan in May, Murphy blocked that effort, mandating the U.S. to retain custody of the detainees and to offer them a chance to contest their deportation. The administration transferred the detainees to the Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti, where U.S. officials described dangerous conditions, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "But the Supreme Court last month suspended Murphy's ruling from April. And on Thursday, it said Murphy could no longer require the government to allow the detainees in Djibouti to contest their deportation, since the order underpinning that requirement had been paused.",
      "Hours later, immigrant rights advocates asked a different federal judge, Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., to halt the deportations to South Sudan. He did so on Friday, but only briefly before saying the request should be handled by Murphy.",
      "Moss expressed concern about risks to the men's \"physical safety\" and said the U.S. government should not be in the business of inflicting \"pain and suffering\" on people who have already served their sentence, even for a \"terrible crime.\" But he said his hands were tied, telling the advocates they needed to ask Murphy for any intervention.",

    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk is floating a new political party dubbed the \"America Party\" \u2014 but the idea could face major hurdles.",
    "story": [
      "As billionaire Elon Musk feuds with President Trump over his signature tax and domestic policy legislation, Musk has reupped his calls to launch a new political party \u2014 a daunting task even for the wealthiest person on Earth.",
      "Musk first floated launching a third party, dubbed the \"America Party,\" earlier this month, part of a nasty back-and-forth between the president and the Tesla CEO that marked the likely end of their political alliance. The billionaire raised the idea of a third party again last week as lawmakers raced to send the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Mr. Trump's desk \u2014 saying he would start the party if Congress passed what he\u00a0described as\u00a0an \"insane spending bill.\"",
      "On Saturday, a day after Mr. Trump signed the bill into law, Musk wrote in a social media post that the \"America Party\" had formed after\u00a0polling his followers on X.",
      "\"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!\" Musk said in the post. \"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.  Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Mr. Trump reacted to the idea of Musk's new party, saying it would cause \"total disruption and chaos.\" The president also said Musk is \"off the rails\" and was \"becoming a train wreck\" over the past five weeks.",
      "Musk did not offer any other details on the formation of the \"America Party\" this weekend, and it's unclear what steps he has taken so far.",
      "Since Musk decided to launch a new political party, he'll need to contend with a thicket of complicated state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules and intense litigation.",
      "\"Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,\" Brett Kappel, a veteran election lawyer, told CBS News last week.",
      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Musk wrote on X Friday\u00a0that a nascent political party could \"laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,\" arguing, \"that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws.\" On Sunday, Musk said he initially plans to focus on congressional races, but\u00a0\"Backing a candidate for president is not out of the question.\"",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process of forming a new national party is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge the issues himself on Sunday, saying Musk \"even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States - The System seems not designed for them.\"",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired in late June. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said Sunday on Truth Social that Musk previously told him that he \"had no problems\" with the elimination of the electric vehicle mandate, \"which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time.\"",

      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): The National Weather Service has indicated that, with that and NOAA, that we needed to renew this ancient system that has been left in place with the federal government for many, many years. And that is the reforms that are ongoing.",

      "JASON ALLEN: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has now signed an expanded disaster declaration order. You can see there is a little bit of rain here in the area this morning, but it's not expected to be anything like we saw the past couple of days, Weijia.",
      "And although officials say that this is still an active rescue mission, they acknowledge that, as the hours go by, it becomes less and less likely that they will find anyone alive.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Our hearts are with all those families.",
      "Jason Allen in Kerrville, Texas, thank you.",
      "We turn now to Kevin Hassett. He is the director of the National Economic Council and one of President Trump's top advisers. He's also very popular on that driveway, where I'm usually alongside about a dozen reporters.",
      "So, Kevin, thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "I want to start with trade, because there's a big deadline coming up on Wednesday, as you know. That 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs that the president announced back in April is set to end. So far, the U.S. has announced a few deals, the U.K., Vietnam, and you're inching closer to a final agreement with China.",
      "Do you expect to get any more deals done with America's biggest trading partners by Wednesday?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Yes.",
      "First, I do have to take a pause and share your thoughts and prayers with the people of Texas. It's an incredible, heartbreaking story. And Kristi Noem and the president have instructed the federal government to throw everything they have got at helping the survivors and helping clean up that place.",
      "And so, anyway, I'm really heartbroken today to see these stories. And I want you to know that, in the White House, everybody is putting every effort they can into helping the people of Texas today.",
      "On trade, there's going to be quite a bit of news this week. And I think the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized. There are a whole number that Jamieson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments. And then there are going to be letters that are sent to countries saying, here's how we think it ought to go because the deals aren't advanced enough.",
      "And the headline is going to be that countries are agreeing around the world to open their markets up to our products and to allow us to put some kind of tariff on their products when they come into the U.S. And exactly what the numbers will be will be things that you will find out in the news this week.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And, Kevin, you said there are going to be deals.",
      "For those really important trading partners, if there's not a deal by Wednesday, is the president going to extend this pause?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: You know, the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world. And there are deadlines and there are things that are close. And so maybe things will push back the dead \u2013 past the deadline, or maybe they won't.",
      "In the end, the president is going to make that judgment.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And you also mentioned those letters that will start going out tomorrow, according to President Trump. He said about 10 to 12 countries will receive them.",
      "Do you \u2013 can you tell us who's going to get one and what they say?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: I'm sorry, I can't, because \u2013 because, again, the part of the letter that could be happening, right, is that we're close to a deal, we're not really satisfied with the progress that we're making in the deal, and so we're saying, OK, fine we're going to send a letter, but maybe you get a deal at the last minute too.",
      "Until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Is it fair to say that those notices are going to go to our smaller trading partners, as you negotiate with our bigger ones?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: I think that it could be that it'll be both.",
      "But also don't forget that, when we have great trade deals, our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners. And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I have to ask you about the deadlines, Kevin, to make these deals, because you just mentioned you're always open. The president said there's not really any flexibility left between now and Wednesday.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said that deals would be wrapped up by Labor Day. So I wonder if \u2013 how can companies plan if the goalposts keep moving? How can countries negotiate if they don't even know how much time they have left?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well, the rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear to everybody, because we have some deals, like the U.K. and the Vietnam deal, that are starting to be, I guess, guidelines for what might happen.",
      "But one of the things that we're seeing that's really interesting to me is that people are just onshoring production to the U.S. at a record rate. And so we have had record job creation, record capital spending. And this is even ahead of the Big Beautiful Bill. And so I think what's happening is that people are responding to President Trump's potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the U.S., which is creating jobs, more than two million jobs since he took office, and raising wages.",
      "You know, wage growth is heading up towards the really, really high pinnacles that we saw in 2017. And so I think there's a race right now to get activity into the U.S. And, in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I remember, after these reciprocal tariffs were announced, you told me that there are about 15 deals that countries were bringing to the president.",
      "How close \u2013 if you could give us any number at all, what number are we going to see this week?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, you will have \u2013 you will have to get that from Jamieson and the president. I think that we have seen lots of deals that have been finalized by negotiators, and then the president finds things that can make them better.",
      "And so it's \u2013 I'm not going to get ahead of the president on the number of deals.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK, thanks, Kevin. We will look out for that.",
      "I want to move now to the One Big Beautiful Bill that\u2026",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: \u2026 of course, the president signed into law on Independence Day.",
      "You have it, and now you have to pay for it. And there's a consensus that this bill adds tremendously to the deficit. I know that you are so familiar with these numbers. The Yale Budget Lab estimates it will add $3 trillion to the debt. The Tax Foundation says this tax portion of the bill could also add $3 trillion to the deficit.",
      "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which factors an interest on the debt, says it could add up to $5 trillion over the next decade. And on this very program, even Speaker Johnson answered in the affirmative when asked if this bill would add over $4 trillion to the deficit.",
      "I know that the administration says the bill will actually shrink the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Help me understand\u2026",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: \u2026 why there is such a drastic difference between your numbers and all those others.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Well \u2013 well, first of all, let's remember that science is not democracy. Truth is not democracy.",
      "Our estimates are based on modeling that we used last time when I was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to say what would happen if we had a bill, how much growth we would get. And we said \u2013 and we were criticized soundly \u2013 that we would get 3 percent growth.",
      "And we even had the really technical macroeconomic models that said that we would get 3 percent growth. We run the same models through this tax bill, it's even better. And what we're seeing is that, if you get 3 percent growth again, then that's $4 trillion more in revenue than the CBO and these other bodies are giving us credit for.",
      "They have been wrong in the past, and they're being wrong again, in our belief. But the thing that disappoints me is that, if I put out a model and I say, hey, here's what's going to happen, we're going to get 3 percent growth, and then it turns out it's 1.5 percent growth, then, as an academic economist, as a scientist, then it's my duty to say, what did I get wrong? What did my model miss?",
      "These people aren't doing that. And that's the thing that I find disappointing, because we put peer-reviewed academic stuff on the table and said, we're going to get that 3 percent growth, and then we got it right last time. And we believe we're going to get it right this time.",
      "But if you think that 1.8 percent growth is what's going to happen over the next 10 years, then you should agree with the CBO number. But there's another part of the CBO number that you need to worry about. And that is that, if we don't pass the bill, then it's the biggest tax hike in history.",
      "And with that big tax hike, then, of course, we would have a recession. The CEA says that we'd have about a 4 percent drop in GDP and lose nine million jobs. If we had a 4 percent drop in GDP and we lost nine billion jobs, what would happen to the deficit?",
      "And so I don't think that the CBO has a very strong record. I don't think these places have a very strong record. And what they need to do is get back to the basics of looking at macroeconomic models. There's a really famous macroeconomist in Harvard named Jim Stock. They should go back and read everything Jim Stock has written for the last 15 years and fold those into their models, and then maybe we could talk.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to talk to you, Kevin, about another number that I know you and the president disagree with, but that Democrats and many Republicans are worried about.",
      "And that's the CBO's projection that as many as 12 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage because of this law. What is the NEC's estimate for how many people could lose coverage?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yes, let's unbundle that a little bit, because, first, on the CBO coverage, so what are we doing?",
      "So what we're doing is, we're asking for a work requirement, but the work requirement is that you need to be looking for work or even doing volunteer work, and you don't need to do it until your kids are 14 or older. And so the idea that that's going to cause a massive hemorrhaging in availability of insurance doesn't make a lot of sense to us.",
      "And then, if you look at the CBO numbers, if you look at the big numbers they say that people are going to lose insurance, about five million of those are people who have other insurance. There are people who have two types of insurance. And so, therefore, if they lose one, they're still insured.",
      "And so the CBO numbers on that side don't make any sense to us at all, but, on the other side, go back to 2017, when we had work requirements for Obamacare, and they said that we'd lose about four million insured between 2017 and 2019, and about double that over the next 10 years. And, in fact, the number of insured went up, went up quite a bit, by more than 10 million, over those two years, because the bottom line is, the best way to get insurance is to get a job.",
      "And we have got a Big Beautiful Bill that's going to create a lot of job creation and a lot of insurance. And the CBO is just not accounting for that.",
      "And, again, they need to go back and look at all the things that they got wrong. You realize that they're underestimating Medicaid spending by 20 percent. They should look back at all the things they got wrong and explain what they're going to do to get it right in the future and to do a better job. And if they do that, we will take them more seriously.",
      "But, right now, I don't think any serious thinker could take them seriously, because they have done so wrong \u2013 been so wrong for so long. Even back \u2013 if you go back to when President Obama passed Obamacare, they got every single number there wrong about how many people would get private insurance and how few people would get Medicaid and so on.",
      "And so their record in this modeling space is about as bad as it's possible to be. In fact, you could kind of roll the roulette wheel and come up with a better set of numbers, a better history, track record history, than CBO.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, Kevin, what about the enhanced subsidies? Is that number wrong too, that the ACA allows about $705 for people to help pay for their health insurance?",
      "That doesn't sound like the waste, fraud and abuse that I know you and the president have talked about eliminating. That just sounds like people who cannot afford coverage, and now it's going to be even more so with these subsidies gone.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well \u2013 well, what \u2013 what \u2013 if you're \u2013 if you're looking at the \u2013 the change in the tax on the providers, which is something that has been a key talking point for the Democrats, they say that that's going to close down rural hospitals, what has happened is that, rather than let the states \u2013 the states have this game where they give a dollar to a hospital, and then the federal government matches the dollar, and then the state taxes some of the dollar away.",
      "In other words, that we have an agreement with the states that they're going to match, but then they have this trick where they tax the hospitals after they give them money, so really it's the federal government giving them money. And that's why we have been overspending Medicaid by 20 percent since this trick started happening.",
      "And so what we have done is that we have put a haircut on that, but we have also put $50 billion into a trust fund to make sure that the rural hospitals are there to treat the sick.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: And so I think this is a prudent reform. It's sound budgetary politics, and I think that nobody's going to lose their insurance.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Kevin Hassett, we will watch for how that ages.",
      "Thank you very much. Really appreciate your time.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: And if I get it wrong, we will check and we will talk about why I got it wrong, I promise.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK.",
      "Thank you. We will have you back. Thank you very much, Kevin.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Thanks, Weijia Jiang.",
      "We now turn to Congressman \u2013 Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We turn now to New York Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi.",
      "Congressman, thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-New York): Yes, thanks so much for having me.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, you just heard from Kevin Hassett.",
      "You know, like President Trump, he said, without this bill, it would be one of the greatest tax hikes for the American public. They say it is the greatest tax cut in American history.",
      "You sit on the Ways and Means Committee, so I have to wonder how you describe it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I describe it as the big, ugly bill, not the Big Beautiful Bill.",
      "It's going to do a lot of things that are going to hurt a lot of people in our country. The biggest one, which you talked about with Mr. Hassett, is increase the deficit enormously in the country. And what that does is, that creates inflation, that keeps interest rates high, that makes it hard for people to buy homes, makes it hard for them to borrow money to do the things that they want to do.",
      "In addition, it's going to knock a bunch of people off of health care. We know that the Republicans have tried for a decade to undo the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, and this is kind of a backdoor way to take health insurance away from people that really need it the most here in our nation.",
      "And it's going to cause health insurance costs to go up for a lot of people. One of the president's biggest issues he campaigned on was reducing prices rapidly. On day one, we're going to cut the costs.",
      "Well, costs are not going down. Inflation \u2013 inflation is going to be affected by this deficit. Interest rates are going to stay high, and this is going to have a negative impact on health insurance costs for many people in our country.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I know that you just brought up Medicaid and potential loss of coverage. What do you say to some Americans who might wonder, well, why should the able-bodied not have to work in order to access Medicaid?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, you have to understand that 92 percent of the people that are able to work are currently working, and the 8 percent that are not are often people that are taking care of disabled children.",
      "Remember that two-thirds of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. One-tenth of all the veterans in the United States of America are on Medicaid. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many people that are facing such difficult circumstances that we can't even possibly imagine.",
      "And why would we be taking health insurance and food benefits away from some of the most needy Americans, while we're providing what I believe is an unnecessary tax break for some of the wealthiest Americans? It just doesn't make sense that you're reducing taxes for some of the wealthiest people, hurting some of the lowest-income people, while blowing the biggest deficit in the budget that we've had in the history of the country.",
      "Those things just don't add up.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, just last week, you said you agree with 75 percent of what's in this package. That's a pretty significant number. So why isn't it worth the 25 percent that you don't like?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because those things that I just mentioned are so devastating.",
      "I like the idea that we're investing more money to secure the border. I like the idea that we are paying \u2013 providing tax breaks to lower-income folks and hardworking middle class folks and people aspiring to the middle class.",
      "I like the idea of providing tax breaks for those folks. But why are we providing \u2013 and when the economy is doing as well as it has been over the past several years, why would we be providing a tax decrease, tax breaks for some of the wealthiest Americans in our country, while blowing a massive hole in the deficit?",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Congressman, I want to turn to an op-ed that you wrote in \"The Wall Street Journal\" last week saying Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City's Democratic mayoral primary should be a \u2013 quote \u2013 \"loud wakeup call for Democrats.\"",
      "What lessons do you think your party can learn from \u2013 from his campaign?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, you know, I disagree with Mr. Mamdani. I have to make that very clear that, you know, I'm a Democratic capitalist. I'm not a Democratic socialist.",
      "And \u2013 but you have to recognize that he tapped into something. He tapped into the same thing that Donald Trump tapped into, which is that people are concerned that the economy is not working for them. Affordability and the economy is the number one issue in the country.",
      "And, too often, Democrats are not perceived as being focused on affordability and the economy and the middle class, and people aspiring to the middle class and their economic concerns. They see Democrats as being primarily focused on reproductive rights and on LGBT protections, which are important issues, but they're not the issues that people think about every night when they're lying in bed thinking about paying their bills or when they're talking about how they're going to send their kids to school.",
      "So Democrats have got to do a better job learning from both Trump and Mamdani, not with their solutions, which I think are wrong, but with the diagnosis of the problem, that we're frustrated, we're concerned. Everybody in America, whether you're a right-wing conservative or a left-wing progressive, should believe that, in return for working hard, you make enough money so you can live a good life.",
      "You can buy a home, you can educate your children, you can pay for your health insurance, you can retire one day without being scared. People don't feel that currently, and we have to do a better job of communicating that.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, I'm glad you brought up the perception, because you also wrote that Democrats must recognize the future starts with a message of economic security for American families.",
      "I covered the Biden campaign. I covered the Harris campaign. That was the center of their messages. So what's the problem here? Is it the messenger? Is it the messaging? Because they have that message already.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: It's a combination.",
      "Number one, the Democratic Party as a whole has to have this platform that focuses on what the people care about. They care about the economy. They care about immigration. They care about taxes. They care about crime. They care about health care.",
      "But then we have to recognize that the media infrastructure is fractured. And Trump figured it out before the Democrats have, which is that it's not just traditional media, like your shows and newspapers, but it's social media. It's podcasts.",
      "Podcasts, the top 500 podcasts in America, 400 of the top 500 are right- leaning, 100 are left-leaning, and of the 100 left-leaning ones, half of them beat the you-know what out of the Democrats. Then you have other national media, and then you have some of this ethnic and underground media related to WeChat and WhatsApp and different types of apps that people use.",
      "So we have to communicate across all those platforms, because people are getting their messages in these fractured environments and living in these echo chambers. And we have to do a better job communicating across all these platforms and getting Democrats as a whole to focus on the economy, immigration, et cetera.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: All right, Congressman, we are all trying to learn all those new languages. Thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "A day ahead of America's 249th birthday, \"CBS EVENING NEWS\" co-anchor John Dickerson met up with filmmaker and historian Ken Burns at Monticello, Virginia, the home of our third president, Thomas Jefferson. Burns has a new film out this November on PBS entitled \"The American Revolution,\" and he gave us a preview.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You call the \u2013 the revolutionary period a civil war.",
      "KEN BURNS (Documentary Filmmaker): It is.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Was that always your conception of the \u2013",
      "KEN BURNS: No.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How did you come to think of it that way?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think because there's no photographs and there's no news reels and they're in, you know, stockings and breaches and powdered wigs there's a sense of distance from them. I think we also are so proud, rightfully, of the power of the big ideas that we \u2013 we just don't want to get into the fact that it was this bloody civil war, patriots against loyalists, disaffected people, native people, enslaved and free people within it, foreign powers that are in \u2013 ultimately engaged in this. This is a big world war by the end.",
      "I think we \u2013 we \u2013 we perhaps are fearful that those big ideas are diminished and they're not in any way. They're, in fact, become even more inspiring, that they emerge from the turmoil.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How should we think about the Declaration of Independence this period in America in our present day?",
      "KEN BURNS: First of all, I think the American Revolution is the most important event since the birth of Christ in all of world history.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Why?",
      "KEN BURNS: I mean it turned the world upside down, which is the cliche. Before this moment, everyone was a subject. Essentially under the rule of somebody else. We had created in this moment a very brand-new thing called a citizen. And this has had powerful effects. It's going to set in motion revolutions for the next two plus centuries all around the world, all attempting to sort of give a new expression to this idea that all men are created equal, that they're endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. And that's a big, big deal in world history.",
      "So, what happens here is I suppose you could, you know, miss the point and say it's a quarterfinal between Englishmen, but it is the beginning of something absolutely new in the world. And \u2013 and that is something to celebrate. And to understand, too, that it comes out of so much division that's going on between the states. People in New Hampshire and Georgia are \u2013 they're \u2013 they're from different countries. They believe different things, that you could have the divisions of \u2013 of loyalists and patriots, you could have this \u2013 all the \u2013 the things that are rolling in these colonies and understand that out of that we could still figure out a way to come together.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Americans think they're pretty divided right now. They weren't nearly as divided as they were during the revolutionary period.",
      "KEN BURNS: Here is the simple thing. We're always divided. So, it \u2013 it ebbs and flows a little bit, but we're always have big differences.",
      "You know, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal is not met with universal approval. The Civil War kills 750,000 Americans we think over the issue of slavery. We have our own revolution. There are lot of periods. The Vietnam period, when we're so particularly divided.",
      "So, I think there's a little bit of chicken little, you know, oh, the sky is falling because now things are always worse now than they ever were. The only \u2013 the reason why historians, and God knows I'm an amateur historian, feel a kind of optimism is because there's something familiar. There's, you know, the Bible says there's nothing new under the sun, human nature essentially doesn't change, and that's true.",
      "What's great about the revolution is, for a moment things actually \u2013 there was something new in the world. And that's the thing that we need to use. That's the leverage we have to bring us back to the ability to speak to one another, to understand how you solve your differences, as opposed to the sort of soup of anger and \u2013 and distrust that seemed to be, you know, everywhere now.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What is a citizen's obligation now?",
      "KEN BURNS: A citizen's obligation now is the same as it's ever been. And that's the most important thing. There's a wonderful phrase, a little bit later from the famous words, where Jefferson says, \"all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable.\" Meaning, we all kind of have gravitated to be under authoritarian rule. You know, the trains running on time, or we get at least this. But we're going to require of you to be a citizen something more. It's got to be active.",
      "The pursuit of happiness is not the acquisition of things in a marketplace of objects, but lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. That's what the founders said. To be virtuous, to live a virtuous life, to continually educate yourself is what was required to sustain this republic. And I think that's what we've gotten away from. Everything is sort of all individualized. We're all free agents. We don't realize that freedom, the thing that we tout, is not just what I want, but also that's intention with what we need.",
      "And I think what happens is that when we study these words, we can go back to the sense of newness and freshness that they represented and rededicate ourselves. And that means me, for me, and you for you, to this idea that the pursuit of happiness is about lifelong learning. It's about becoming ever more educated to the responsibility of citizenship. And that's a huge, huge responsibility. Not just to take your feed, not just to go with the flow, not just to get your information that \u2013 that sort of ratifies what you already thought, but to actually explore what my neighbor thinks.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Being an American, as Jefferson saw it, as the founders saw it, was a continuing obligation to engage with its history.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right. And \u2013 and this is really important, in order to form the government, they had to reach back through the middle ages, through the dark ages, back to antiquity, to bring up these ideas like virtue and temperance and moderation and all of the things that all of them were looking for.",
      "I mean, the amazing things is, we're here at Thomas Jefferson's house, but we don't have a country without his words, but also we don't have a country without George Washington. And yet we know about all of these men. They're deeply flawed, in many important ways. And I think today, in our binary culture, you know, where everything's a one or a zero, or it's a red state or a blue state, it's my way or the highway, we've forgotten that it's possible to tolerate, as we do among \u2013 with the people we love, their strengths and their weaknesses.",
      "So, heroism is not perfection if we can take an historical view that permits us to see a Jefferson and a Washington in \u2013 in these very complicated understanding of them, then it's possible to then breathe, to have some room to understand who we are now, who we were then, and where we might be, which is, of course, the most important thing. All the anxiety about this present moment is really not so much about the present moment, but about, will we survive.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Can you talk about the genius and brilliance of his words without sitting right in the middle Jefferson's owning of slaves, enslaved people?",
      "KEN BURNS: No. I think this is the important thing. And somehow we've \u2013 we've gotten to the idea that you just don't want to mess with the good stuff and let's just pretend \u2013 pay no attention to that man behind the \u2013 you can't do that. A good story is a good story is a good story. And this is a really good part of the story. It's complicated. It's dark. There are human beings in this house who are owned by a person who has articulated universal rights for everyone. And what's so great is that the vagueness of the words has allowed everybody to plow through and make it their own. Not just here, but all around the stuff.",
      "So \u2013 so, when he says \"pursuit of happiness,\" that may be the key word. When we say a \"more perfect union\" in the Constitution later on, that may be the key word, that this is a process that we're engaged in. And so maybe the \u2013 the poetry, but also the vagueness of the words have opened a door that have \u2013 have \u2013 have allowed women to come through, that have allowed enslaved people to have citizenship, that have expanded in so many different ways. And all around the world, that that's \u2013 this is progress.",
      "And so, I think going back and understanding them for the deep undertow that's present, and sometimes really discomforting undertow about it, is OK. It's \u2013 nothing is diminished. Don't make a Madison Avenue version of - - of \u2013 of our past, but celebrate the grittiness. And I think in this case, the violence of the American Revolution, we do a service to those ideas that we think need to be protected. I mean, with \u2013 this is not ideas that are fixed in amber, you know, this is \u2013 this is \u2013 this is gritty, gritty stuff. People died. Lots of people died fighting for this in \u2013 in just horrific struggles when the main form of killing was a bayonet. That's not fun.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: President Trump has issued an executive in which he says basically history has gotten out of balance as of the American government, either funds it through museums or national parks, and he said instead that \u2013 that this federal role in history should instead \"focus on the greatness of the achievements and the progress of the American people.\"",
      "So, President Trump thinks there's an imbalance in the way we talk about history. How do you see that?",
      "KEN BURNS: I don't see the imbalance. I think we need to celebrate the greatness of the American people. The greatness of the American people comes from telling these compensated stories. And \u2013 and \u2013 and that's a good story is a good story is a good story. That's what you're looking for. You don't want to just say is, otherwise it's just sort of slogans that are \u2013 that are put up on the wall.",
      "We want to feel that we know who Thomas Jefferson is. We need to understand the internal struggles that Abraham Lincoln had. We have to understand what was going through Rosa Parks' mind when she, you know, refused to give up her seat on the bus. This in no way take away from the glory (ph), it makes the story fuller and richer and \u2013 and permits purchase for everyone. You - - you want a \u2013 a history to be complicated because it gives everybody a chance to own or have access to it.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Diversity of voice in storytelling was important to you. That also is under assault at the moment. The president basically is trying to remove all efforts to keep diversity in mind. Is there something that is lost in that?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, you know, there's a strength in the wagon wheel of all the different spokes into the hub. We're all looking for the hub, whatever the hub is. Meaning, you know, something that pulls us together, that chorus. That's what we're all about.",
      "And so that \u2013 the strength of that wheel has to do with having the spokes and having a multitude of perspective. The impulse for some is to say there's only one perspective. And that's true of many different things. Sometimes say it's got to be only from this perspective. It's got to be Freudian or it's got to be Marxist economic or it's got to be symbolic or it's got to be, you know, post-modern, or whatever the thing is. You don't need that.",

      "People don't re-read The Declaration every Fourth of July, as Thomas Jefferson wanted. People, in your telling, seem to have lost sight of some of the parts of our founding. Maybe we don't even know them because we've been told different kinds of stories. Is this an intervention?",
      "KEN BURNS: No. Intervention imposes between the storyteller, that would be us, and the story we're trying to tell and our audience, some sort of larger, high-fluting purpose. A good story is a good story is a good story. And that's all we're interested in doing.",
      "The Fourth of July is my favorite holiday because you sit there on a blanket, on a field, looking at these fireworks with all of these other people in the dark and you share with them in common that we agree to basically a sentence in a \u2013 in a \u2013 in a document, written, you know, by a Virginian who lived here, you know, 249 years ago. That's really powerful stuff.",
      "So, the fact that it can be misinterpreted by some, this is always going to be the case. Manipulated by others, this will always be the case. Sort of, you know, genuinely embraced but for the wrong reasons, this will always be the case. But we still, we know. We understand that we hold these truths to be self-evident, even though they weren't, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It doesn't get any better of that.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You've told a lot of your stories on PBS. PBS is under threat.",
      "KEN BURNS: All off them. All of them. All of them (INAUDIBLE).",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Are you worried about the future of PBS?",
      "KEN BURNS: Of course I am. And I've always been worried about it. In the 1990s, I think I testified in the House or the Senate, in appropriations or authorization about the endowments are about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting a half dozen times.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Make the case for PBS.",
      "KEN BURNS: It is the Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world. It's a bottom up. It's the largest network in the country. There's 330 stations. It mostly serves, and this is where the elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is so shortsighted, it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only they get. They also have not only our good children's and primetime stuff, they have Classroom of the Air continuing education, homeland security, crop reports, weather, emergency information. That we're going to take away? This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left wing thing when this is the place that for 32 years gave William F. Buckley a show. And it's \u2013 I mean it's \u2013 and it's - - that show is, by the way, is still going on and moderated by a conservative.",
      "So, I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And I couldn't do \u2013 let me personalize it. And I didn't want to. John, I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS. I \u2013 I could go into a streaming service or a premium cable tomorrow and get every one of the millions of dollars it took to do this in one pitch. But they wouldn't give me ten years. They want it in a year or a year and a half. And that's \u2013 I can't do that. Same with Vietnam. Same with the Civil War. Same with jazz. Same with the national parks. Same with, you know, the Roosevelts. All these \u2013 country music. All of those have taken time to incubate. And that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out. Kind of like the national parks, or the Declaration of Independence, applied to the landscape.",

      "JOHN DICKERSON: As someone who worked so hard on telling the story of slavery and enslaved people in various different ways, what did you learn about slavery in America from working on this?",
      "KEN BURNS: It's so complicated and so interesting. I \u2013 I think the thing that was most striking that's come to me is that it was really clear that our founders, even those founders who owned other human beings, knew that the institution of slavery was indefensible. It's only later in the 19th century that you'll sort of make \u2013 you try to make excuses for why it's OK. And that they're really wrestling with ways. But there are human beings that are owned by other human beings. It's very, very complicated. And you can never say a categorical them about anybody. And that's all we do.",
      "Look, I have \u2013 I have made films about the U.S. for all of my professional life. But I've also made films simultaneously about us. All of the intimacy of that and all the majesty and complexity and contradiction and controversy of the U.S. And the thing I've learned, if I've learned anything, is that there's only \"us.\" There's is no \"them.\" And we're constantly being told there's a them. There is no them.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: If there is only \"us,\" and no \"them,\" it is also a strain in American history, look at them, go get them.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's right. It's the simplest thing. It's the authoritarians' playbook.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: There's a lot of talk about \"them\" these days. Are you hoping to pierce that with this telling of America's beginning?",
      "KEN BURNS: I \u2013 I don't have a conscious desire to do this. This implies a kind of agenda, a kind of a political agenda.",
      "We consciously understand, as we're working on a film, how many \u2013 how much is rhyming in the present and it changes a little bit and changes that. But we don't ever try to put neon signs going, look how much this is so much like today. We just want to let that resonate. And you go, oh my goodness, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they may have wigs and they may have breaches. They're very much like us.",

      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right. You have to let it tell the story. Our job is to be a good storyteller, period, full stop, end of sentence.",

You know, this is a big \u2013 a good story is a big house with lots of different doors. And we tend to go through the front door and think that's it. Somebody may be coming in the side door. Somebody may be coming \u2013 climbing up and \u2013 and breaking in from the second story. However you get in, you're in. And that's all you want is the \u2013 it \u2013 you know, stories are invitations. Like, honey, how was your day, right? It doesn't begin, I backed slowly down the driveway, avoiding the garbage can at the curb. You \u2013 you just edit human experience and that's what we spent the last ten years doing. We were saying, this story of the American founding, our \u2013 our creation myth, is as important a story to get right as anything. And we've spent ten years trying to get it right.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What is the difference between the Revolutionary War and the American Revolution?",
      "KEN BURNS: Benjamin Rush, who is the great physician of the time, one of the signors of The Declaration, said that when it was over, that the \u2013 the American war is over, but the American revolution is going on. I think if you accept the idea of pursuit of happiness, if you accept the idea of a \"more perfect union,\" you realize, as we do in our own lives and our own work, in our own relationships, that it's about process. That we're engaged in an ongoing desire to achieve these things. This perfection is what you want to tilt for. It's unattainable, obviously. But if you're not engaged in the active pursuit of perfection, self, relationship, community, country, world, then you're stopped. You're static. And you're not going forward.

      "\"There's going to be quite a bit of news this week, and I think the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "With President Trump's 90-day freeze on sweeping U.S. tariffs set to expire Wednesday, the White House has touted new trade agreements with countries in recent weeks, like China, the U.K. and Vietnam. But there are still questions heading into the week with other deals yet to be announced.",
      "The president on April 2 unveiled a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "Hassett said Sunday that there are a \"whole number\" of deals that U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments, along with letters to be sent to countries where \"deals aren't advanced enough\" this week. Mr. Trump told reporters Friday that the U.S. will start sending letters Monday to around a dozen countries.",
      "Though Hassett wouldn't share any details about the countries set to receive the letters, he said the notices could go to both small and large trading partners. Hassett outlined the possibility of getting a deal \"at the last minute\" with the letters, saying \"until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.\"",
      "Asked by senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang whether the president will extend the pause for some of the most important trading partners if deals don't come together by Wednesday, Hassett said \"the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world.\"",
      "\"There are deadlines, and there are things that are close, and so maybe things will push back past the deadline, or maybe they won't,\" Hassett said. \"In the end, the president's going to make that judgment.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday that he would likely start the tariffs on Aug. 1. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the president would send the letters, informing countries that \"'if you don't move things along, then, on Aug. 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level.'\" Bessent clarified that \"it's not a new deadline,\" but rather \"we are saying this is when it's happening.\"",

      "WEIJA JIANG: We turn now to Kevin Hassett. He is the director of the National Economic Council and one of President Trump's top advisors. He's also very popular on that driveway where I'm usually alongside about a dozen reporters. So, Kevin, thank you so much for your time this morning. I want to start with trade, because there's a big deadline coming up on Wednesday. As you know, that 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs that the President announced back in April is set to end. So far, the US has announced a few deals; the UK, Vietnam, and you're inching closer to a final agreement with China. Do you expect to get any more deals done with America's biggest trading partners by Wednesday?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yeah. First, I do have to take- take a pause and share your thoughts and prayers with the people of Texas. It's an incredible, heartbreaking story, and Kristi Noem and the President have instructed the federal government to throw everything they've got at helping the survivors and helping clean up that place. So, anyway, I'm really heartbroken today to see these stories, and I want you to know that in the White House, everybody is putting every effort they can into helping the people of Texas today. On trade, there's going to be quite a bit of news this week. And, I think, the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized. There are a whole number that Jameson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments, and then they're going to be letters that are sent to countries saying, here's how we think it ought to go, because the deals aren't advanced enough. And the headline is going to be that countries are agreeing around the world to open their markets up to our products, and to allow us to put some kind of tariff on their products when they come into the US. At exactly what the numbers will be, will be things that you'll find out in the news this week,.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin, you said there are going to be deals. For those really important trading partners, if there's not a deal by Wednesday, is the President going to extend this pause?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world. And there are deadlines, and there are things that are close, and so maybe things will push back the dead- past the deadline, or maybe they want- in the end, the President's going to make that judgment.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: And you also mentioned those letters that will start going out tomorrow, according to President Trump. He said about 10 to 12 countries will receive them. Do you- can you tell us who's going to get one and what they say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Because- because, again, the part of the letter that could be happening right is that we're close to a deal, we're not really satisfied with the progress that we're making at the deal, and so we're saying, okay, fine, we're going to send a letter, but maybe you get a deal at the last minute too. Until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Is it fair to say that those notices are going to go to our smaller trading partners, as you negotiate with our bigger ones?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think that it could be that it'll be both. But also, don't forget, that when we have great trade deals, our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners. And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I have to ask you about the deadlines, Kevin, to make these deals, because you just mentioned you're always open. The president said there's not really any flexibility left between now and Wednesday. Less than two weeks ago, the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that deals would be wrapped up by Labor Day. So, I wonder, you know, if- how can companies plan if the goal posts keep moving? How can countries negotiate if they don't even know how much time they have left?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, the rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear to everybody, because we have some deals like the UK, and the Vietnam deal that are starting to be, you know, I guess, guidelines for what might happen. But, one of the things that we're seeing that's really interesting to me, is that people are just on-shoring production of the US at a record rate. As we've had record job creation, record capital spending, and this is even ahead of the Big, Beautiful Bill. And so, I think what's happening is that people are responding to President Trump's, you know, potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the US, which is creating jobs, more than 2 million jobs, since he took office, and raising wages. You know, wage growth is heading up towards the really, really high pinnacles that we saw in 2017. And so, I think there's a race right now to get activity into the US. And, in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I remember after these reciprocal tariffs were announced, you told me that there were about 15 deals that countries were bringing to the President. How close, if you could give us any number at all, what number are we going to see this week?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yeah, you'll have- you'll have to get that from Jameson and the President. I think that, you know, we've seen lots of deals that have been finalized by our negotiators, and then the President finds things that could make them better. And so, it's- I'm not going to get ahead of the President on the number of deals.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Okay, thanks, Kevin. We'll look out for that. I want to move now to the One Big, Beautiful Bill that, of course, the President signed into law on Independence Day. You have it, and now you have to pay for it. And there's a consensus that this bill adds tremendously to the deficit. I know that you are so familiar with these numbers. The Yale Budget Lab estimates it will add $3 trillion to the debt. The Tax Foundation says this tax portion of the bill could also add $3 trillion to the deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which factors in interest on the debt, says it could add up to $5 trillion over the next decade. And on this very program, even Speaker Johnson answered in the affirmative when asked if this bill would add over $4 trillion to the deficit. I know that the administration says the bill will actually shrink the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Help me understand why there is such a drastic difference between your number and all those others.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well- well, first of all, let's remember that science is not democracy. Truth is not democracy. Our estimates are based on modeling that we used last time, when I was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to say what would happen if we had a bill, how much growth we would get. And we said, and we were criticized soundly, that we would get 3% growth. And we even had the really technical macroeconomic models that said that we would get 3% growth. We run the same models through this tax bill, it's even better. And what we're seeing is that if you get 3% growth again, then that's $4 trillion more in revenue than the CBO and these other bodies are giving us credit for. They have been wrong in the past, and they're being wrong again, in our belief. But, the thing that disappoints me is that if I put out a model and I say, hey, here's what's going to happen, we're going to get 3% growth. And then it turns out it's 1.5% growth, then, as an academic economist, as a scientist, then it's my duty to say, what did I get wrong? What did my model miss? These people aren't doing that. And that's the thing that I find disappointing, because we put peer-reviewed academic stuff on the table, said we're going to get that 3% growth, and then we got it right last time, and we believe we're going to get it right this time. But, if you think that 1.8% growth is what's going to happen over the next 10 years, then you should agree with the CBO number. But, there's another part of the CBO number that you need to worry about. And that is that if we don't pass the bill, that it's the biggest tax hike in history. And with that big tax hike, that of course, we would have a recession. The CEA says that we'd have about a 4% drop in GDP and lose 9 million jobs. If we had a 4% drop in GDP and we lost 9 million jobs, what would happen to the deficit? And so, I don't think that the CBO has a very strong record. I don't think these places have a very strong record. And what they need to do is get back to the basics of looking at macroeconomic models. There's a really famous macroeconomist at Harvard named Jim Stock. They should go back and read everything Jim Stock has written for the last 15 years, and fold those into their models, and then maybe we could talk.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I want to talk too, Kevin, about another number that I know you and the President disagree with, but that Democrats and many Republicans are worried about, and that's the CBO's projection that as many as 12 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage because of this law. What is the NEC's estimate for how many people could lose coverage?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well- well, yeah. Let's- let's unbundle that a little bit. Because, first, on the CBO coverage, so what are we doing? So, what we're doing is we're asking for a work requirement. But, the work requirement is that you need to be looking for work, or even doing volunteer work, and you don't need to do it until your kids are 14 or older. And so, the idea that that's going to cause a massive hemorrhaging in availability of insurance, doesn't make a lot of sense to us. And then, if you look at the CBO numbers, if you look at the big numbers, they say that people are going to lose insurance. About 5 million of those are people who have other insurance. They're people who have two types of insurance. And so, therefore, if they lose one, they're still insured. And so, the CBO numbers on that side don't make any sense to us at all. But, on the other side, go back to 2017 when we had work requirements for Obamacare, they said that we lose about 4 million insured between 2017 and 2019, and about double that over the next 10 years. And, in fact, the number of insured went up. It went up quite a bit, by more than 10 million over those two years, because the bottom line is, the best way to get insurance is to get a job. And we've got a Big, Beautiful Bill that's going to create a lot of job creation and a lot of insurance, and the CBO is just not accounting for that. And again, they need to go back and look at all the things that they got wrong. You realize that they're underestimating Medicaid spending by 20%. They should look back at all the things they got wrong, and explain what they're going to do to get it right in the future, and to do a better job. And if they do that, we'll take them more seriously. But right now, I don't think any serious thinker could take them seriously, because they've done so wrong, and wrong for so long. Even back- if you go back to when President Obama passed Obamacare, they got every single number there wrong about how many people would get private insurance and how few people would get Medicaid, and so on. And so, their record in this modeling space is about as bad as it's possible to be. In fact, you could, kind of, roll the roulette wheel and come up with a better set of numbers, better history, track record than CBO.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin, what about the enhanced subsidies? Is that number wrong too? That the ACA allows about $705 for people to help pay for their health insurance. That doesn't sound like the waste, fraud, and abuse that I know you and the President have talked about eliminating. That just sounds like people who cannot afford coverage, and now it's going to be even more so with the subsidies gone.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well- well, if you're- if you're looking at the- the change in the tax on the providers, which is something that has been a key talking point for the Democrats, they say that that's going to close down rural hospitals. What has happened is that, rather than let the states- the states have this game where they give a dollar to a hospital and then the federal government matches the dollar, and then the state taxes some of the dollar away. In other words, that we have an agreement with the states that they're going to match, but then they have this they have this trick where they tax the hospitals after they give them the money, so really, it's the federal government giving them the money. And that's why we've been overspending Medicaid by 20% since this trick started happening. And so, what we've done is that we've put a haircut on that. But, we've also put $50 billion into a trust fund to make sure that the rural hospitals are there to treat the sick. So, I think this is a prudent form. It's sound budgetary politics. And I think that nobody's going to lose their insurance.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin Hassett, we will watch for how that ages. Thank you very much. Really appreciate --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: - And if I get it wrong, we'll check, and we'll talk about why I got it wrong. I promise.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 6, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We turn now to New York Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi. Congressman, thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI: Yeah, thanks so much for having me.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, you just heard from Kevin Hassett- you know, like President Trump, he said, without this bill, it would be one of the greatest tax hikes for the American public. They say it is the greatest tax cut in American history. You sit on the Ways and Means Committee, so I have to wonder how you describe it.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I describe it as the big, ugly bill, not the 'big, beautiful bill.' It's going to do a lot of things that are going to hurt a lot of people in our country. The biggest one, which you talked about with Mr. Hassett, is increase the deficit enormously in the country. And what that does, is that creates inflation, that keeps interest rates high, that makes it hard for people to buy homes, makes it hard for them to borrow money, to do the things that they want to do. In addition, it's going to knock a bunch of people off of health care. We know the Republicans have tried for a decade to undo the Affordable Care Act- Obamacare, and this is kind of a backdoor way to take health insurance away from people that really need it the most here in our nation. And it's going to cause health insurance costs to go up for a lot of people. One of the President's biggest issues he campaigned on was reducing prices rapidly on day one, we're going to cut the costs. Well, costs are not going down, inflation- inflation is going to be affected by this deficit. Interest rates are going to stay high, and this is going to have a negative impact on health insurance costs for many people in our country.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I know that you just brought up Medicaid and potential loss of coverage. What do you say to some Americans who might wonder, well, why should the able bodied not have to work in order to access Medicaid?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, you have to understand that 92% of the people that are able to work are currently working, and the 8% that are not are often people that are taking care of disabled children. Remember that two thirds of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. One-tenth of all the veterans in the United States of America are on Medicaid. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many people that are facing such difficult circumstances that we can't even possibly imagine. And why would we be taking health insurance and food benefits away from some of the most needy Americans while we're providing what I believe is an unnecessary tax break for some of the wealthiest Americans. It just doesn't make sense that you're reducing taxes for some of the wealthiest people, hurting some of the lowest income people, while blowing the biggest deficit in the budget that we've had in the history of the country. Those things just don't add up.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, just last week, you said you agree with 75% of what's in this package, that's a pretty significant number. So why isn't it worth the 25% that you don't like?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Because those things that I just mentioned are so devastating. I like the idea that we're investing more money to secure the border. I like the idea that we are providing tax breaks to lower income folks and hard working middle class folks and people aspiring to the middle class. I like the idea of providing tax breaks for those folks. But why are we providing- and when the economy is doing as well as it has been over the past several years, why would we be providing a tax decrease- tax breaks for some of the wealthiest Americans in our country, while blowing a massive hole in the deficit?",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Congressman, I want to turn to an op-ed that you wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week saying, Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City's Democratic mayoral primary should be a quote, 'loud wake up call for Democrats.' What lessons do you think your party can learn from- from his campaign?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, you know, I disagree with Mr. Mamdani. I have to make that very clear that, you know, I'm a Democratic capitalist. I'm not a Democratic socialist. And- but you have to recognize that he tapped into something. He tapped into the same thing that Donald Trump tapped into, which is that people are concerned that the economy is not working for them. Affordability and the economy is the number one issue in the country. And too often, Democrats are not perceived as being focused on affordability and the economy and the middle class, and people aspiring to the middle class and their economic concerns. They see Democrats as being primarily focused on reproductive rights and on LGBT protections, which are important issues, but they're not the issues that people think about every night when they're lying in bed thinking about paying their bills or when they're talking about how they're going to send their kids to school. So Democrats have got to do a better job learning from both Trump and Mamdani not with their solutions, which I think are wrong, but with the diagnosis of the problem that we're frustrated, we're concerned. Everybody in America, whether you're a right wing conservative or a left wing progressive, should believe that in return for working hard, you make enough money so you can live a good life. You can buy a home, you can educate your children, you can pay for your health insurance, you can retire one day without being scared. People don't feel that currently, and we have to do a better job of communicating that.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, I'm glad you brought up the perception, because you also wrote that 'Democrats must recognize the future starts with a message of economic security for American families.' I covered the Biden campaign. I covered the Harris campaign. That was the center of their messages. So what's the problem here? Is it the messenger? Is it the messaging? Because they have that message already.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: It's a combination. Number- the Democratic Party as a whole has to have this platform that focuses on what the people care about. They care about the economy, they care about immigration, they care about taxes, they care about crime, they care about health care. But then we have to recognize that the media infrastructure is fractured, and Trump figured it out before the Democrats have, which is that it's not just traditional media like your shows and newspapers, but it's social media. It's podcasts. Podcasts, the top 500 podcasts in America, 400 of the top 500 are right leaning. 100 are left leaning. And of the 100 left leaning ones, half of them beat the, you know what, out of the Democrats. Then you have other national media, and then you have some of this ethnic and underground media related to WeChat and WhatsApp and different types of apps that people use. So we have to communicate across all those platforms, because people are getting their messages in these fractured environments and living in these echo chambers, and we have to do a better job communicating across all these platforms and getting Democrats as a whole to focus on the economy, immigration, et cetera.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Alright, Congressman, we are all trying to learn all those new languages. Thank you so much for your time this morning. And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Ken Burns said it's \"shortsighted\" to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as public media has become a target of the White House in recent months.",
      "\"This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left-wing thing,\" Burns said of cutting funds to PBS in an interview that aired Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in May instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. Then in June, the House approved a request from the White House to claw back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The package is expected to be taken up by the Senate in the coming weeks as the White House has targeted the public media entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "Burns, whose upcoming film \"The American Revolution\" is expected to air on PBS in November and has had more than 40 documentaries on the public broadcaster, told \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson that he's worried about PBS' future, noting that he's \"always been worried about it.\"",
      "The filmmaker recalled testifying before congressional committees in the 1990s about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He likened PBS to the \"Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world,\" saying it's \"bottom up.\"",
      "The funding cuts are \"shortsighted,\" Burns said, because \"it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only signal they get.\"",
      "Burns stressed that PBS has children's programming, continuing education, information on homeland security, crop reports and weather emergencies, saying, \"that, we're going to take away?\"",
      "\"I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bath water,\" Burns said.",
      "The filmmaker also noted that his films wouldn't be possible without PBS, saying he wouldn't be afforded the time it takes to produce his films elsewhere.",
      "\"I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS,\" Burns said, noting that streaming services or cable \"wouldn't give me 10 years.\"",
      "Of his work, Burns said many of the projects have \"taken time to incubate, and that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out, kind of like the National Parks or the Declaration of Independence applied to the landscape.\"",
      "\"These are really good American institutions that represent everybody from the bottom up, which is what it's always about,\" Burns said. \"That's the essence of what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.\"",

      "JOHN DICKERSON: So Ken, let's imagine it's July 3, 1776, what is happening in America?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, this house is empty. What's happening in America is that in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress are debating this Declaration of Independence that a committee of five has drawn up. They've handed it off to Thomas Jefferson, one of the youngest, but who has a great felicity, someone said, with language to draft because you've got a pretty large geopolitical situation going on that people don't necessarily appreciate that we've got the French who are kind of interested in maybe helping us because they're so anti-British. But first of all, you have to say that you're a part and then you have to win a battle which is even harder to come by. And so we are here in this, you know, the early, early summer of 1776 debating, and the next day we'll sign this thing, and we will become the United States of America. Someone had suggested earlier in June in a newspaper anonymously signed Republicus, that we ought to have a real name, and suggested it should be the United States of America just, just a few weeks before it's, it's a pretty wonderful moment.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Was America United though in 1776 when they were about to make this big step?",
      "KEN BURNS: No, we'd been fighting for a year and a quarter. Lexington and Concord are as- is, is in April of '75 there- this is a civil war that's going on. More than likely you might be a loyalist. You've lived under the, you know, the British constitutional monarchy. You know, there's no better form of government on earth. Why would I risk anything for this, you know, upstart ideas that have zero chance of success? And what happens is that this document that Jefferson principally crafts is a document that is distilling a century of enlightenment thinking into one sentence, the second sentence of the Declaration, which is, you know, next to I love you, I can't think of a better sentence in the English language.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: America- you call the Revolutionary period a civil war.",
      "KEN BURNS: It is.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Was that always your conception of the\u2013",
      "KEN BURNS: No.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How did you come to think of it that way?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think because there are no photographs and there's no newsreels, and they're in, you know, stockings and breeches and powdered wigs. There's a sense of distance from them. I think we also are so proud, rightfully, of the power of the big ideas that we we just don't want to get into the fact that it was this bloody civil war, patriots against loyalists, disaffected people, Native people, enslaved and free people within it, foreign powers that are ultimately engaged in this. This is a big world war by the end. I think we perhaps, are fearful that those big ideas are diminished, and they're not, in any way. They're, in fact, become even more inspiring that they emerge from the turmoil. You could even look at our civil war and say, it's not really a civil war, not a lot of civilian deaths, and it's a sectional war, but the revolution, you definitely do not want to be in New Jersey or South Carolina, because people are in kind of open revolt. People, there are guerilla actions. There's little assassinations, taking things out on your neighbor who's a loyalist, when the Patriots are dominant, taking things out on your neighbor who's a patriot, when the British and the Loyalists are dominant in a particular area. It's really, really bad.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How should we think about the Declaration of Independence, this period in America, in our present day?",
      "KEN BURNS: First of all, I think the American Revolution is the most important event since the birth of Christ in all of world history.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Why?",
      "KEN BURNS: I mean, it turned the world upside down, which is the cliche. Before this moment, everyone was a subject, essentially under the rule of somebody else. We had created, in this moment, a very brand new thing called a citizen and this has had powerful effects. It's going to set in motion revolutions for the next two plus centuries, all around the world, all attempting to sort of give a new expression to this idea that all men are created equal, that they're endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that's a big, big deal in world history. So what happens here is, I suppose you could, you know, miss the point, and say it's a quarrel between Englishmen, but it is the beginning of something absolutely new in the world, and that is something to celebrate and to understand too, that it comes out of so much division that's going on between the states. People in New Hampshire and Georgia are, they're from different countries. They believe different things. That you could have the divisions of loyalists and patriots. You could have this, all the things that are roiling in these colonies, and understand that out of that, we could still figure out a way to come together.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Americans think they're pretty divided right now. They weren't nearly as divided as they were during the Revolutionary period.",
      "KEN BURNS: Here's the simple thing, we're always divided, so it ebbs and flows a little bit, but we're always have big differences. You know, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal is not met with universal approval. The Civil War kills 750,000 Americans, we think, over the issue of slavery. We have our own revolution. There are lots of periods, the Vietnam period, when we're so particularly divided. So I think there's a little bit of chicken little, you know, oh, the sky is falling because it's now. Things are always worse now than they ever were. The only- the reason why historians, and God knows, I'm an amateur historian, feel a kind of optimism, is because there's something familiar. There's, you know, the Bible says there's nothing new under the sun, human nature essentially doesn't change, and that's true. What's great about the Revolution is, for a moment, things actually, there was something new in the world, and that's the thing that we need to use. That's the leverage we have to bring us back to the ability to speak to one another, to understand how you solve your differences, as opposed to the sort of soup of anger and distrust that seem to be, you know, everywhere now.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: John Dos Passos said that when men, in times of where men feel quick sand under their feet, history is a lifeline to the- from the past to the present. What lifeline do you see from the Revolutionary period, if we're always divided, what's the lifeline to the present from the Revolutionary period?",
      "KEN BURNS: That's a wonderful phrase. I think it's manifest in so many different ways. Obviously, we're the only country, we know exactly when we were born, and we're the country that's held together, not by language, not by religion, not by even geography, we're held together by words. And so I think, to me, it always comes back to words, and why being here, you begin to realize the incredible power and import of those words that we hold these truths to be self evident. And you know, John, there was nothing self evident about those words. As someone said in an earlier film we made about, about Benjamin Franklin, this is the lawyers dodge, right? It's like there's nothing self-evident about this. But if you say it's self-evident, we just like we, of course, all agree this is true, and then say something that is so new in the world that it is still inspiring. I mean, I would normally be home on July 4 reading to my children the Declaration of Independence, because it has so much import and so much meaning, even today. And I think it doesn't take as much effort as we think it does to reinvest in those things that we share in common.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What's, what are, what is a citizen's obligation now?",
      "KEN BURNS: A citizens obligation now is the same as it's ever been, and that's the most important thing. There's a wonderful phrase a little bit later from the famous words where Jefferson says, All experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, meaning we all kind of have gravitated to be under authoritarian rule. You know, the trains run on time, or we get at least this, but we're going to require of you to be a citizen something more. It's got to be active. The Pursuit of Happiness is is not the acquisition of things in a marketplace of objects, but lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. That's what the founders said, to be virtuous, to live a virtuous life, to continually educate yourself, is what was required to sustain this republic and I think that's what we've gotten away from. Everything is sort of all individualized. We're all free agents. We don't realize that freedom, the thing that we tout, is not just what I want, but also that's intention with what we need. And I think what happens is that when we study these words, we can go back to the sense of newness and freshness that they represented and rededicate ourselves, and that means me for me, and you for you, to this idea that the pursuit of happiness is about lifelong learning. It's about becoming ever more educated, to the responsibility of citizenship and that's a huge, huge responsibility, not just to take your feed, not just to go with this flow, not just to get your information that sort of ratifies what you already thought, but to actually explore what my neighbor thinks.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Being an American, as Jefferson saw it, as the founders saw it, was a continuing obligation to engage with its history.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right, and this is really important. In order to form the government, they had to reach back through the Middle Ages, through the Dark Ages, back to antiquity, to bring up these ideas like virtue and temperance and moderation and all of the things that all of them were looking for. I mean, the amazing thing is, we're here at Thomas Jefferson's house, but we don't have a country without his words. But also we don't have a country without George Washington. And yet, we know about all of these men. They're deeply flawed in many important ways. And I think today, in our binary culture, you know, where everything's a one or a zero or it's a red state or a blue state, it's my or the highway, we've forgotten that it's possible to tolerate, as we do among with the people we love, their strengths and their weaknesses. So heroism is not perfection, right? The Greeks told us that heroism was a negotiation within someone, sometimes a war between somebody's great strengths and their great flaws, like Achilles had his heel and his hubris to go along with his great strengths. And so I think that if we can take a historical view that permits us to see a Jefferson and a Washington in these very complicated understanding of them, then it's possible to then breathe, to have some room to understand who we are now, who we were then, and where we might be, which is, of course, the most important thing, all the anxiety about this present moment is really not so much about the present moment, but about will we survive, where will we be and and you can go back to this moment and be completely inspirited by possibility.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Is it necessary to understand the flaws of the founders so that they become more real and therefore their lessons are more accessible?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think so. I think we know what a superficial story means; its half life is so insignificant when you put everything into sort of cartoon stuff, into the white hat and the black hat and what that means. Yes, when you understand, Keats said that Shakespeare possessed this thing called negative capability that you could hold in tension someone's strengths and someone's weaknesses for as long as you possibly could and then, even then, you didn't necessarily have to make a decision. So you can understand George Washington as flawed as rash. He rides out on the battlefield of making bad decisions as a general. And yet, without him, we do not have a country. You know, we're speaking English or we're speaking French or Spanish, whatever it is, but, but we're a different, we're a different place without his, the leadership that he exhibited, and of course, that leadership was exhibited most spectacularly when he resigned his military commission and then left the presidency because he was giving up power and setting in motion an American example, that it isn't the person, it's the law. It's the- it's the form of government and these sorts of things have held us in good stead for 249 years.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You've named so many instances in which, basically America was thought into being, in other words, a set of ideas, just words, just the stuff that was going on in a bunch of heads of people ended up shaping an entire nation, and as you're saying, a course of history.",
      "KEN BURNS: So it isn't just Jefferson's words, right? You've have before it, in January, this Englishman who comes ashore at Philadelphia, half dead. He's a failure in everything in life, and he writes this little, tiny pamphlet called Common Sense. His name is Thomas Paine, and he gives just spectacular, almost poetic voice to this impulse. Like heretofore, people are not sure they want to separate from Britain, not sure about independence. They certainly would like to believe it's really not the king's fault, it's really Parliament's fault. And all of a sudden, he reminds people what monarchical and authoritarian rule is all about, and that you know, this idea that you could install yourself by virtue of your family for generation after generation isn't right, and so lots of words earlier, Sam Adams is keeping everybody alive to their grievances, he said, that's his job, right? He's, he's a failure as a brewer and as a tax collector, but boy, he's really good at keeping people upset at what the British are doing, or maybe not even doing, but may do, right? And so words are hugely important, and we are the sum total of the words we've talked about, rather than just, necessarily always the actions or the money or the place or the position or the celebrity. It's, it's, you know, Washington is interesting in that he's also a great judger of character. He knows how to pick subordinate talent like you can't believe, like you can't believe. I mean, even this committee that essentially (INAUDIBLE)\u00a0by his age, that- that Benjamin Franklin is the sort of the senior of all seniors. But Adam says, you know, to Jefferson, you write it because, like, I'm short and fat and ugly and people don't like me. I'm obnoxious, but you have this great felicity of, with words.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: We're here in Jefferson's house. What if Tom walked in? What would you want to ask him?",
      "KEN BURNS: Oh, my goodness, a lot of them are deeply personal questions about his own life and what he couldn't deal with. He knew, as everyone knew, that slavery was immoral. It's only later generations that are going to try to justify it as the abolition movement grows in the 19th century, we're going to have to make Black people inferior in all of this. But there is a- there's a sense that, you know- he- Jefferson himself said slavery was like holding a wolf by the ears. You didn't like it, but you didn't dare let go. I'd want to ask him, deeply question, why don't you let it go? Your neighbor freed his slaves, your cousin freed his slaves. They both urged you to do the same thing, and you couldn't do that. You temporized. You bought more statuary and more wine from Europe and- and what was that about? Because, of course, you could articulate these universal, self evident truths, and yet couldn't live that out in his own lifetime.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Can you talk about the genius and brilliance of his words without sitting right in the middle of Jefferson's owning of slaves, enslaved people? You- can you talk about the two- I mean, can you talk about Jefferson's words without talking about--",
      "KEN BURNS: No, I think this is the important thing. And- and somehow we've- we've gotten to the idea that you just don't want to mess with the good stuff. And let's just pretend- pay no attention to that man behind- like you can't do that. A good story is a good story is a good story. And this is a really good part of the story. It's complicated, it's dark. There are human beings in this house who are owned by a person who has articulated universal rights for everyone. And what's so great is that the vagueness of the words has allowed everybody to plow through and make it their own, not just here, but all around the stuff so- so when he says pursuit of happiness, that may be the key word. When we say a more perfect union in the Constitution later on, that may be the key word that this is process that we're engaged in. And so maybe the- the poetry, but also the vagueness of the words, have opened a door that have allowed women to come through, that have allowed enslaved people to have citizenship, that have expanded in so many different ways and all around the world, that that's- this is progress. This is, you know, this is- and also the course of human events, right? Where you don't flick the switch, and it's all perfect, all at once. And so I think going back and understanding them for the deep undertow that's present and sometimes really discomforting undertow about it is okay. Nothing is diminished. Nothing is diminished. In fact, I think it's made more familiar. You know what? When it is- when you're in a conversation with a friend and the friend says, you know, I should have said this before, but I really hate this. Or, you know what, I did this, there's something suddenly, there's dimension now to the possibilities of the connection, one to the other. And I think when we look back and don't try to sanitize it. Don't make a Madison Avenue version of- of- of our past, but celebrate the grittiness, and I think, in this case, the violence of the American Revolution, we do a service to those ideas that we think need to be protected. I mean- what- this is not ideas that are fixed in amber. You know, this is, this is- this is gritty, gritty stuff. People died. Lots of people died fighting for this in just horrific struggles when the main form of killing was a bayonet. That's not fun.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: More authentic, more true, and therefore more real and accessible.",
      "KEN BURNS: Yeah. And then I think more powerful. That's- what we're looking for is meaning. At the end of the day, it's all about meaning. And so the stories that we tell, the truer, the more complicated they get, actually, the meaning increases. It's not decreased. It's only an authoritarian that wishes to, you know, in the old Soviet thing, where all of a sudden that photograph no longer has so and so in it, he's no longer there watching the May Day parade. They've cut him out because he's out of favor. We don't need to do that in this country. We can actually be big enough to accept these contradictions within our founding and within ourselves. Jefferson is certainly the embodiment of deep and- and very complicated, you know, differences, internal psychology.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: President Trump has issued an executive action in which he says basically, history has gotten out of balance. Says that the American government either funds it through museums or national parks, and he said instead that this federal role in history should instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and the progress of the American people. So President Trump thinks there's an imbalance in the way we talk about history. How do you see that?",
      "KEN BURNS: I don't see the imbalance. I think we need to celebrate the greatness of the American people. The greatness of the American people comes from telling these complicated stories, and that's a good story. A good story is a good story. That's what you're looking for. You don't want to just say it otherwise, it's just sort of slogans that are- that are put up on the wall. We want to feel that we know who Thomas Jefferson is. We need to understand the internal struggles that Abraham Lincoln had. We have to understand what was going through Rosa Parks' mind when she, you know, refused to give up her seat on the bus. This, in no way takes away from the glory, it just makes the story fuller and richer and and permits purchase for everyone you want a history to be complicated because it gives everybody a chance to own or have access to it. There is my door where I'm going through. There's a wonderful scholar, Maggie Blackhawk in our film, who says, after our scene on the Declaration of Independence, that it's deeply significant to people at the margins. That these words that do not include them. They do not include women, they do not include the poor, they do not include any enslaved or free African Americans. They do not include Native Americans. But the words themselves are so inspirational that they begin to suggest a much larger and more, what we would say, kind of American polity. That a bunch of us all together, of different varieties, doing lots of different things and pursuing happiness, this- this idea of virtue and lifelong learning.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Along those lines, that- the stories you tell in this documentary and the people who tell it are-\u00a0 there's a real diversity. Was that an important part of your storytelling?",
      "KEN BURNS: Absolutely, I think that, you know, we tend to have the Revolution, we think of it as just the guys in Philadelphia, which is really important, thinking great thoughts and writing them down. The boldface names, if you will. What we wanted to do is take those boldface names and make them not just kind of inaccessible, but real. So you could understand dimension to them. But then also realize they're scores of other people that have voices and that are important, and they, you know, they're .01% of people had their portraits painted. That doesn't mean that everybody else didn't exist, or everybody else didn't do something, particularly if you gave your life on Bunkers Hill to start this new nation, or- or- or- at Yorktown, or at Brandywine or Long Island. You know, just because you don't have a portrait painted, it doesn't mean that you're not somebody. So we're trying to give everyone a voice, and so that what you have is a chorus. So it all goes back to music. Always goes back to music that, you know, Lincoln talks about, the mystic chords of memory. These are not ropes. These are celestial chords that- that the chorus of Americans has an emotional power to it, that the singularity of just making it about a great man theory. You- the problem has been in that, at times- and may have to do with Trump's initiatives, is that we've- in order to tell a bottom up story, we sometimes thrown out a top down story. There's no need. You can do a top down and a bottom up. And that's actually the most vigorous and active and most powerful form of history is when they meet. When- as you are in a tent a few 100 yards from Rochambeau's tent outside Yorktown, you being George Washington, that you also know that that group that's taking Redoubt Number 10 has, led by Lafayette, includes Alexander Hamilton, but also has Joseph Plumb Martin, who signed up a couple days after the declaration at age 15, and has just seen unbelievable action and violence and whatever, is rushing the abattis, the spiked logs that are going to protect them, along with Rhode Islanders who have been promised their freedom after the war is over, both runaway and enslaved Rhode Island- I mean, this is who takes Redoubt Number 10 that permits us, along with Redoubt Number 9 that the French take to roll the big guns in to make Cornwallis painfully aware, if he has not been aware of it at to the- up to that point that his cause is lost, and will precipitate the surrender that will come a few days later.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Diversity of voice and storytelling was important to you, that also is under assault at the moment. The president basically is trying to remove all efforts to keep diversity in mind. Is there something that is lost in that?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, you know, there's a strength in a wagon wheel of all the different spokes into the hub. We're all looking for the hub, whatever the hub is. Meaning, you know, something that pulls us together, that chorus, that's what we're all about. And so that the strength of that wheel has to do with having the spokes and having a multitude of perspectives. The impulse for some is to say there's only one perspective, and that's true of many different things, and it isn't just from a top down, sort of a sense, so let's make this simpler. It's also- a lot of people mistake, and what we've tried to do is be liberated from any fashion of what's called historiography. Sorry, to you know, on a Sunday morning, make the words so big, but it's sort of the fashions of the way we study history. Sometimes say it's got to be only from this perspective. It's got to be Freudian, or it's got to be Marxist economic, or it's got to be symbolic, or it's got to be, you know, post-modern or whatever. The thing is, you don't need that. You- all you need to do is say, if a kid was involved, I want to understand what that kid felt. If a great, you know, person that George Washington, I want to know what he- what he did and what he felt. Did he really need to ride out into the battle at Kips Bay and risk his own life. I mean, at one time at Princeton, he does the same thing, and his own aides are covering their eyes, afraid they're going to see their commander in chief- if he's shot it's all over. There's no country, right? And then watch him make mistakes, and at the same time, see the way he held like the strongest of glues the country together as it's going.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You say history is the best teacher we have. What did working on this documentary about the Revolution teach you?",
      "KEN BURNS: You know, here's- here's the- the lead that has been buried. This is the most important experiment in human government that the world has seen. And we- we bury that light under a bushel all the time, either through our internal doubts, either through our struggles with one another, through this kind of binary sense of, you know, I'm wrong. You're- you know, you're right. I'm right, you're wrong. Whatever it might be, we- we've- we've missed the most important thing that the creation of the United States of America was one of the great things that have ever taken place in human history, and that's something to celebrate.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: So in looking in the past, you discovered something that should be and is, and you're seeing very much alive today.",
      "KEN BURNS: This is what makes history the best teacher, because it permits you to understand that there- it wasn't always some beautiful, great time beforehand. It's always been complicated. There's always been enormous divisions, and we always have had an ability by using the force of the system we created. I mean, these guys at the Constitutional Convention, they are worrying constantly about, you know- how to- well, what if this happens? Well, what if that happened? How do we protect about this? How do we protect about that? And they're all trying to, I mean, with the exception of the Preamble, the Constitution is extraordinarily just boilerplate language. It's an operating system, right? But it's so good, and the fact that it's immediately amended, it wouldn't have even been able to go into effective use without the Bill of Rights that were sort of essentially codifying what everybody thought they had been fighting for over the last many, many, many years. And remember, this is a battle that's been, you know, with the British the struggle has been going on from well before Lexington and Concord, with the Boston Massacre or the Tea Party or other, you know, acts of collective disobedience. But in April 19, 1775, it begins. And it's not over until 71 when the surrender happens in the fall, so six and a half years. But it's not going to be till the last British troop leaves, another two years, and the Treaty of Paris is formalized. I see you're talking about a huge period of time that we're engaged in a revolution, and there's lots of stuff going on.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Why did you originally want to make this?",
      "KEN BURNS: I thought it was impossible to do. When we were finishing our film on the Vietnam War in 2015- we began this when Barack Obama had, you know, 13 months left in his pres- presidency. People often say, why the Revolution and why now? I said, this is a really long now. I- having done the Civil War and World War Two and Vietnam, I realized the last big remaining thing was to sort of peel away the layers of sentimentality and nostalgia that has smothered the revolution and to try to get at that. And I didn't think, because there are no photographs and newsreels, that we would be able to do that, but I remember seeing a map of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, a kind of animated, almost 3-D map that we had made. And I went, wait this- this could easily be just following the British West in Long Island towards Brooklyn. And if you- we can do this, then we have a way- we can treat the paintings like they're photographs. We can take live cinematography and treat them like they're paintings. We can collect reenacting footage, not to replace, you know, telling this our traditional way of telling a battle, but as grist for the mill of how we could make it come alive. And all of those things, graphics and maps and live cinematography and paintings and drawings, all of them, I suddenly had this thing. I remember just turning to Sarah Botstein and saying, we're doing the revolution next. Now, next meant 10 years, or almost 10 years.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What layer of sentimentality about the revolution to you is most dangerous to the true history or to the complexity of histories?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think the most dangerous thing is to not understand how incredibly violent it was and how many different parties were involved. We'd like to believe that our revolution is our own wonderful thing that we did, but we can't do it without the French. This is a global war at the end, in which not only the- France is on our side, but so is Spain and the Netherlands, but they have ulterior motives. They really just want to see the British, who have the largest and most far flung empire, diminish. So you've got all these wonderful competing things that people go, \"it's too complicated.\" It's not too complicated. Everybody gets it. If you can watch Shogun and figure it out, if you can watch The Bear, if you can watch Succession, you know, it's all- we know how to handle complicated stories. And I kind of resent the idea that we're told that we can't. That for the most important stories that Americans could ever have, that is the story of us, not just the upper case U.S., but of us intimately, that somehow we have to dumb it down. Sometimes- somehow we have to sort of sanitize it. Somehow we have to make it free of the \"yes, buts.\" All of life is a \"yes, but.\"",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What about attention? Do you also- What about attention? The idea that people just don't have the time for all this?",
      "KEN BURNS: When I made the Civil War series, people said, oh, this is really good, but no one's going to watch it because there are these things called MTV videos, and they're like, two minutes, and they've eroded the attention span. People have always had their attention drawn to little, tiny, frivolous things. Always, forever. And they've also been able to realize that the greatest meaning accrues in duration, that the work you're proudest of, the relationships you care the most about, have benefited from your same attention- sustained attention. So what do we do now in this tsunami of content? We binge. What? You mean, you look at something for days on end, the whole thing over and over? We- the attention is there. It is true that there are lots of distractions to that attention. But the way we self, you know, medicate from the sheer amount of stuff there is, is by saying, I'm going to choose to watch this for a really long time. I see that in my kids who do TikTok stuff, but they'll sit there and watch four seasons of whatever it is in one sitting. So I'm not worried that there's not an audience anymore out there for 12 hours on- on sort of the Rosetta Stone, of what- of where we came from, what our birth was about.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Going back to this idea of ongoing nourishment of history, part of- go back to the revolution to learn who we are, now. Do you ever think of this work as an intervention in- we've gotten- people don't- people don't reread the Declaration every fourth of July, as Thomas Jefferson wanted. People, in your telling, seem to have lost sight of some of the parts of our founding. Maybe we don't even know them because we've been told different kinds of stories. Is this an intervention?",
      "KEN BURNS: No. Intervention imposes between the storyteller, that would be us, and the story we're trying to tell and our audience some sort of larger highfalutin purpose. A good story is a good story is a good story, and that's all we're interested in doing. I do still read the Declaration of Independence to my children now, grandchildren every single Fourth of July. I think there are lots of Americans who do that. Certainly, there are lots of people who go, great a day off and hot dogs and hamburgers, what could be better? And tell me, what could be better than that? It's okay. Everybody likes the fireworks display. There's- there's still it's- once again, it's back to this idea of chorus. The Fourth of July is my favorite holiday, because you sit there on a blanket on a field looking at these fireworks with all these other people in the dark, and you share with them in common that we agree to, basically, a sentence in a document written, you know, by a Virginian who lived here, you know, 249 years ago. That's really powerful stuff. And then John Adams, he said it, you know, this is so great, we should be celebrating this every year with bonfires and fireworks and demonstrations. And we do. We followed exactly what they told us to do. So, the fact that it can be misinterpreted by some, this is always going to be the case. Manipulated by others, this will always be the case. Sort of, you know, genuinely embraced, but for the wrong reasons, this will always be the case. But we still- we know, we understand that we hold these truths to be self-evident, even though they weren't, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Doesn't get any better than that.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What is your- How do you receive the polling that shows people are having different views of what it means to be patriotic, and maybe even being patriotic at all is something, maybe, somebody doesn't want to be.",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, I think- I notice that, particularly among a younger generation, that they have lost a kind of connection with the glories of the American experiment because of what they've seen. You know, if you're seven or eight years old and you see George Floyd murdered, you've got a different sense of how much we've delivered on these original promises or not. I think this is- these are ebbing and flowing figures that we can't spend too much of our time being caught up with. We have to spend more of our time working towards it, the pursuit of happiness. It may involve somebody or groups of somebodies telling our stories. It may be, for somebody else, it might be helping out at a food kitchen. It may be somebody else going to school and in their form of scholarship, in science or in the humanities, have figured out something new that we need. Maybe it's in business, where you've discovered some product. Or maybe it's in public service, which is an essential part of all of this. And that public service is not necessarily the president. George Washington understood that the best office was citizen. That's why he resigned. So maybe you begin and it's your school board, maybe it's you know, you're doing something local. But I think that we're- the polling sometimes reflects just a particular anxiety, and these are shifting all the time, all the time. And it- and I can tell you, just in the time it's taken us to work on this film, how much things have- have changed and gone back and changed again. And it doesn't matter, Democrat, Republican, red state, blue state. These are superficial, binary considerations. The more important thing is that is the- that's the tip of the iceberg, right? It's the- it's the massiveness of what's underneath it. And I think a lot of people still share it, and all you need is a story or an anthem or a chorus to sort of provide the opportunities to reconfigure. That's what it is.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You've told a lot of- You've told a lot of your stories on PBS. PBS is under threat.",
      "KEN BURNS: All of them, all of them.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Are you worried about the future of PBS?",
      "KEN BURNS: Of course, I am, and I've always been worried about it. In the 1990s I think I testified in the House or the Senate in Appropriations or Authorization about the endowments or about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting a half dozen times.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Make the case for PBS.",
      "KEN BURNS: It is the Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world. It's a bottom up. It's the largest network in the country. There's 330 stations. It mostly serves \u2013\u00a0 and this is where the elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is so short sighted \u2013 it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only signal they get. They also have not only our good children's and prime time stuff, they have classroom on the air continuing education, homeland security, crop reports, weather emergency information. That we're going to take away? This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left wing thing, when this is the place that, for 32 years, gave William F. Buckley a show, right? I mean, it's- and it's- that show is, by the way, is still going on and moderated by a conservative. So I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bath water. And I couldn't do- let me personalize it, and I didn't want to. John, I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS. I could go into a streaming service or a premium cable tomorrow and get every one of the millions of dollars it took to do this in one pitch, but they wouldn't give me 10 years. They want it in a year or a year and a half, and that's the deal. I can't do that. Same with Vietnam, same with the Civil War, same with Jazz, same with the National Parks, same with, you know, the Roosevelts, all of those- Country Music, all of those have taken time to incubate, and that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out, kind of like the National Parks or the Declaration of Independence applied to the landscape. These are really good American institutions that represent everybody from the bottom up, which is what it's always about. That's the essence of what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: As someone who worked so hard on telling the story of slavery and enslaved people in various different ways, what did you learn about slavery in America from working on this?",
      "KEN BURNS: It's so complicated and so interesting. I- I think the thing that was most striking that's come to me is that it was really clear that our founders, even those founders who owned other human beings, knew that the institution of slavery was indefensible. It's only later in the 19th century that you'll sort of make- you'll try to make excuses for why it's okay and that they're really wrestling with ways, but there are human beings that are owned by other human beings. There are slaves from New Hampshire to- to Georgia. And one person, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed, says it's important to understand that the South is a slave society and the North is a society with slaves, and there's a big difference. So even within the United States, I was learning constantly. Maybe 20,000 Black people fought in the Revolution, probably 15 for the British who had cynically offered them their freedom. Not freedom of loyalists, right? And how you're going to tell I don't know, but- but they are- and then 5,000 fought valiantly for the Patriot cause. It's very, very complicated, and you can never say a categorical them about anybody, and that's all we do. Look, I have- I have made films about the U.S. for all of my professional life, but I've also made films simultaneously about us, all of the intimacy of that, all the majesty and complexity and contradiction and controversy of the U.S. And the thing I've learned, if I've learned anything, is that there's only us, there's no them, and we're constantly being told: there's a them. There's no them and that's what this document produced by the man who- who sat in this room, you know, and looked at, you know, heard his troubled secretary Meriwether Lewis, say, you know what, 15 million got you? It got you this. And, by the way, there's no Northwest Passage, but look what you have here. And you've got, you know, the Lewis and- this is- this is- this is where you know he- he- he learns the whole thing.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: If there is only us and no them, it is also a strain in American history: look at them, go get them.",

You make- if you make an enemy and you say, you know, your problem is that there's that thing happening, but there's really not that. All of the religious traditions remind us that, or try to remind us that, and- and we want to forget it. There's something simplistic about allowing ourselves to be convinced that there is a them, you know, we- we've- we've- we've, in our own political documents, have enshrined the sanctity of the individual. The religious doctrines have been doing that for centuries. And so the idea of making distinctions, you know, I remember I gave a speech at Brandeis, a commencement speech, talking about the Middle East, and I said, these three great religions, all with claim to the same holy ground, have turned it into a shameful graveyard. God does not distinguish between the dead.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: There's a lot of talk about them these days. Are you hoping to pierce that with this telling of America's beginning?",
      "KEN BURNS: I don't have a conscious desire to do this. There's- there's a kind of- that implies a kind of agenda, kind of a political agenda. I know that a good story is a benign Trojan horse. You take it in and it- it- it- at night, it goes into the city, and it doesn't slay anybody. It just reminds them: no them, no them, no them. This is- isn't this wonderful? Isn't this- isn't this important? Isn't this extraordinary? Isn't the complication worth learning about? And that- that's the only thing- that's- if- we have been- we have been really disciplined to say we just want to tell a story. I mean, Mark Twain said history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. We consciously understand, as we're working on a film, how many- how much it's rhyming in the present and it changes a little bit, and changes that. But we don't ever try to put neon signs going, look how much this is so much like today. We just want to let that resonate. And you go, oh my goodness, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they may have wigs and they may have breeches, they're very much like us.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Because if you put too much of a thumb on the scale, you ruin the story, and then you kill the power of the story.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right. You have to let it tell the story. Our job is to be a good storyteller. Period, full stop, end of sentence.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Which means telling a story well enough that somebody might take a conclusion that's totally different than--",
      "KEN BURNS: Oh, absolutely you- you know, I remember watching this and going, oh my god, there's- there's actually places for all different kinds of people to find purchase. You know, this is a big- a good story is a big house with lots of different doors, and we tend to go through the front door and think that's it. Somebody may be coming in the side door. Somebody may be coming- climbing up and- and breaking in from the second- however you get in, you're in, and that's all you want, is, you know, stories are invitations like, honey, how was your day, right? It doesn't begin: I backed slowly down the driveway, avoiding the garbage can at the curb, you- you just edit human experience. And that's what we spent the last 10 years doing. We're saying this story of the American founding, our- our creation myth, is as important a story to get right as anything, and we've spent 10 years trying to get it right.",

      "KEN BURNS: Benjamin Rush, who is the great physician of the time, one of the signers of the Declaration, said that- when it was over, that the- the American war is over, but the American Revolution is going on. I think if you accept the idea of pursuit of happiness, if you accept the idea of a more perfect union, you realize, as we do in our own lives, in our own work, in our own relationships, that it's about process, that we're engaged in an ongoing desire to achieve these things. This perfection is what you want to tilt for. It's unattainable, obviously, but if you're not engaged in the active pursuit of perfection, self, relationship, community, country, world, then you're stopped, you're static, and you're not going forward. And I think there's not an American that does not want to go forward.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: We're here in Jefferson's house. The only thing he was perhaps more proud of than Monticello was the University of Virginia. It's on his tombstone. The president of the University of Virginia just resigned under pressure from the president. What would Jefferson think?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, you know, it's the first university that was founded in the United States without a religious affiliation. It was really important to him that part of this thing that we not make the mistake of the other countries of having a set and recognized religion. And I think that he would be shocked at any kind of interference with the- with the goings on of a laboratory of- of experimentation, a laboratory of education and discovery.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Can we learn about history if the government is telling us what we can and can't do as we try to arrange our- our system for learning?",
      "KEN BURNS: Yeah, you sure can. Stories are kind of subversive in that way. They just tell you stuff, the, sort of, the inconvenient truths of- of stuff that's going on and good stories are- are very much that, I think, and that's what we hope always. I'm not sure that we succeed everywhere, but telling a good story has a kind of way of- of setting aside the mythologies or the certainties, right? There- there's really, you know, the enemy of good anything is certainty. It's always my way or the highway. That just doesn't work. And so stories, good stories, I think, are- are wonderfully- they have a wink to them. And you know, it's just like humor, it hits both the yes and no at the same time. A good story is always going to be collecting the- the complication, the tensions within and between individuals, and when they're represented, then people grow. You're stunted, and you're back to being a subject, you're back to being a superficial peasant, superstitious peasant, if you're- if- if- if you're subscribing to one set of things, you know. It just reminds me of those Soviets editing the photograph, right? Saying, oh, that person doesn't exist anymore. We- we've torn him out. He- he- he doesn't exist. He goes out of our history books. There- it's all there. We- and- and our liberation, you know, Harry Truman is supposed to have said, the only thing that's really new is the history you don't know. I love the idea. New.",

      "The alleged mastermind behind the shooting of conservative Colombian senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay was taken into custody Saturday, nearly a month after the attack, law enforcement authorities said.",
      "Elder Jos\u00e9 Arteaga Hern\u00e1ndez, who uses the aliases \"Chipi\" or \"Coste\u00f1o,\" was arrested in a neighborhood in the northwestern part of the capital, Bogota, National Police Director Maj. Gen. Carlos Fernando Triana told reporters.",
      "Authorities had previously accused Arteaga and other suspects of being near the Bogota park where Uribe was shot in broad daylight on June 7. Three other people have been arrested for participating in the logistics and execution of the crime.",
      "Charges against Arteaga include attempted aggravated homicide; manufacturing, trafficking and carrying firearms or ammunition; and using minors to commit crimes. Interpol issued a red notice against him on Friday.",
      "It was not immediately clear Saturday if Arteaga had an attorney who could comment on his behalf. Authorities said he would make his first court appearance over the weekend.",
      "Triana last month said Arteaga \"has been involved in a life of crime for more than 20 years, performing hit jobs in all types of crimes in Bogot\u00e1.\"",
      "Uribe was giving a political speech in the park when he was attacked from behind, allegedly by a minor who was captured as he fled. He was shot twice in the head and once in the knee, CBS News reported. He underwent a \"neurosurgical\" and \"peripheral vascular procedure\" at the Santa Fe Clinic in Bogota to treat the injuries, and has undergone more surgeries since. He remains in intensive care.",
      "Two other people \u2013 a man and a woman \u2013 were also injured.",
      "The motive for the shooting is still being investigated. In October, Uribe announced his intention to run in Colombia's 2026 presidential election. From his Senate seat, he had become one of President Gustavo Petro's most vocal critics.",
      "The attack has been widely condemned in a country with a dark past in which drug cartels and insurgent groups murdered and kidnapped politicians. Uribe is the son of a journalist who was kidnapped and killed during one of the country's most violent periods, in 1991. Shortly after the shooting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. \"condemns in the strongest possible terms the attempted assassination\" and called the attack \"a direct threat to democracy.\" He blamed \"violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government\" for the shooting.",
      "\"Having seen firsthand Colombia's progress over the past few decades to consolidate security and democracy, it can't afford to go back to dark days of political violence,\" Rubio said. \"President Petro needs to dial back the inflammatory rhetoric and protect Colombian officials.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 20:17:26 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and people who benefit the most are the richest people,\" Kogan added.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

No death tax, no estate tax. No going to the banks and borrowing from in some cases a fine banker, and in some cases shylocks and bad people.\"",

    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that the the U.S. is likely to start informing some countries on Friday what tariffs their exports will face. Earlier in the week, he said doesn't plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff\u00a0pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Countries that fail to come to terms with the Trump administration face potentially large tariff increases. For example, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit EU members with a 50% flat tariff.",
      "\"If this happens, the EU will likely feel compelled to respond in kind, potentially sparking a full trade war and market instability,\" analysts with investment adviser Gavekal said in a report.",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

      "Assateague Island, Maryland \u2014 The shoreline of Maryland's Assateague Island is a familiar place for surfer Zack Tyndall.",
      "A former firefighter paramedic, Tyndall often helped beachgoers there \u2014 but now, as the mayor of nearby Berlin, Maryland, he says safety isn't guaranteed.",
      "\"I don't want to see anybody drown,\" Tyndall told CBS News. \"We had saves where we were able to bring people out, and we had some where we weren't able to, and that's my biggest fear here on the island.\"",
      "The 37-mile-long Assateague Island is shared by both Maryland and Virginia. Each year, millions of people visit the Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland, which is managed by the National Park Service. However, this summer, visiting families are also seeing shuttered lifeguard towers and signs warning that no lifeguards are on duty.",
      "CBS News asked the Park Service about the staffing situation on Assateague Island, but the agency did not directly respond to those questions \u2013 instead, saying in a statement that lifeguard shortages are a \"nationwide concern even outside of our public lands. Many communities and cities across the country are experiencing a lifeguard shortage below ideal levels. Visitors have always had access to unguarded beaches and guarded beaches even after lifeguards leave for the day.\u202fWe appreciate the public's understanding and cooperation as we work to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all.\"",
      "The Trump administration laid off about 1,000 NPS employees in February as part of its push, led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, to enact large-scale personnel and budgetary cuts across the federal government. President Trump also enacted a hiring freeze on federal permanent civilian employees immediately after taking office, which has impacted the Park Service. That hiring freeze has since been extended to July 15.",
      "\"This was a policy put into place by DOGE and the current Trump administration that led to a complete hiring freeze on all hiring across the National Park Service,\" Ed Stierli, Mid-Atlantic region senior director of the National Parks Conservation Association, an independent Park Service advocacy group, told CBS News.",
      "According to analysis released this week by the Conservation Association, the Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since Mr. Trump took office in January. The analysis also determined that about 4,500 seasonal positions have been filled, including lifeguards, well under the 7,700 seasonal positions NPS earlier this year said it was aiming to fill.",
      "\"The reason there are no lifeguards at Assateague is honestly a symptom of the chaos and dysfunction that has been impacting this agency since the beginning of this administration,\" Stierli said.",
      "A Trump administration official told CBS News that all fire, law enforcement and public facing NPS personnel are prioritized to remain in place.",
      "Tyndall, meanwhile, is just hoping for a safe summer in Maryland.",
      "\"Every day that we don't have a lifeguard here on the beach is putting every one of these swimmers, every one of our local residents, everybody that comes to visit Assateague Island, in jeopardy,\" Tyndall said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence arm plans to cut nearly three-quarters of its full-time employees, shaving its Office of Intelligence & Analysis down from about 1,000 staff to just 275, according to four sources briefed on the matter.",
      "The exact timing of the cuts remains unclear; sources tell CBS News the staff reductions have been in the works for months but were temporarily on hold because of rising tensions overseas after the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The decision has raised concerns among the nation's police and intelligence gathering agencies, as the U.S. reckons with a heightened threat environment.",
      "DHS' Office of Intelligence & Analysis \u2014 created after the September 11 terrorist attacks \u2014 is the only member of the U.S. intelligence community tasked with sharing threat information to state, local, tribal and territorial governments across the country.",
      "A DHS spokesperson confirmed the cuts in a statement, saying the department is getting \"back to its core mission of prioritizing American safety and enforcing our laws.\"",
      "\"DHS component leads have identified redundant positions and non-critical programs within the Office of Intelligence and Analysis,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Department is actively working to identify other wasteful positions and programs that do not align with DHS's mission to prioritize American safety and enforce our laws.\"",
      "Last month, the current head of the agency, Daniel Tamburello, informed the intelligence agency's workforce that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had signed off on plans to slash the agency by hundreds of employees, with others reassigned to other DHS components, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "This week, House and Senate lawmakers wrote to Noem and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, warning them to avoid \"this drastic and unilateral step and instead to consult with Congress about alternative ways to make I&A as effective and efficient as possible.\"",
      "\"At a time when DHS is rightly warning about an elevated threat environment from terrorists and cartels, we should be focused on plugging security gaps rather than senselessly creating new ones,\" Democratic Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Jim Himes of Connecticut wrote Wednesday, along with Michigan Sen. Gary Peters and minority leaders on the House Homeland Security Committee, House Intelligence Committee and Senate Homeland Security Committee.",
      "Several law enforcement agencies \u2014 including the Major Cities Chiefs Association, County Sheriffs of America and the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies \u2014 also penned a letter to Noem, pressing her to reconsider. They warned that any downsizing of the intelligence agency could prevent \"vital intelligence\" from reaching the officers and investigators whose job it is to detect and disrupt threats and could create \"dangerous blind spots in our homeland security network.\"",
      "\"[Intelligence and Analysis] is the only component of the U.S. intelligence community with a statutory mandate to share threat information with state and local partners,\" the letter stated. \"The current threat landscape makes our partnership with [Intelligence and Analysis] more critical than ever. Ongoing Middle East conflicts heighten risks of foreign-directed and homegrown violent extremism, as demonstrated by the recent antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado. Transnational criminal organizations continue to shift fentanyl trafficking routes, requiring real time intelligence to intercept deadly substances before they reach our streets\u2026 Weakening [Intelligence & Analysis] would undermine our ability to detect and prevent threats before they occur.\"",
      "Mike Sena, president of the National Fusion Center Association, a network of 2,000 public safety officials operating as hubs of information sharing and threat analysis for local law enforcement, also wrote to congressional leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last month. He warned that \"any reduction in [Intelligence and Analysis'] field-based presence, staffing, or engagement capabilities would negatively impact the critical information flow and coordination necessary to identify and mitigate emerging threats to our communities.\"",
      "Leaders within the National Sheriffs' Associations had a similar message for congressional leaders last month, writing in a letter to GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, that \"[Intelligence & Analysis] is a critical partner in the operations of many of the country's regional fusion centers\u2026 at the center of detecting threats from organized crime, threats to election security, and threats from domestic violence extremism.\"",
      "Last month, DHS activated its National Terrorism Advisory System, alerting more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide of possible \"violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets perceived to be Jewish, pro-Israel, or linked to the US government or military in the Homeland.\"",

    "summary": "The FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers about COVID shot approvals.",
    "story": [
      "Top-ranking Food and Drug Administration officials picked by the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overrode career staff at the agency to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA.",
      "In a memorandum following Novavax's approval in May, which narrowed the shot's label to only seniors ages 65 and older and others at-risk of severe disease, the FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers.",
      "Prasad was named earlier this year to replace Dr. Peter Marks, the longtime head of the agency's center regulating vaccines and other biologics, who was ousted under Kennedy. Prasad was later elevated to the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer as well, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.",
      "Novavax had applied for a license for its shot to prevent COVID-19 for anyone over 12 years old, effectively converting it to a traditional approval from the emergency use authorizations the FDA had granted to the vaccine during the pandemic to allow its use at the time.",
      "Prasad wrote that he questioned the data submitted by Novavax, said COVID-19's risk of severe disease had dropped in the U.S. population, and cited safety concerns that he said \"fundamentally alters the benefit-risk calculation in non-high-risk individuals.\"",
      "\"The decrease in the chance of developing severe COVID-19, means that the potential for absolute benefit from vaccination has simultaneously decreased. Even rare vaccination-related harms, both known and unknown, now have a higher chance of outweighing potential benefits in non-high-risk populations,\" Prasad wrote.",
      "A separate memo released by the agency from Captain Edward Wolfgang, chair of the review team for Novavax's shot, said the changes for who should be approved to get the vaccine followed requests by Prasad and the special assistant to the FDA commissioner.",
      "The agency's career scientists had initially concluded on April 1 that Novavax's data submitted in its Biologics License Application, or BLA, and COVID-19's ongoing public health threat warranted broad approval for use in everyone ages 12 and older.",
      "\"The data submitted with this BLA indicate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Nuvaxovid (2024-2025 Formula) meet the statutory requirements to support its use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2,\" they concluded.",
      "Documents released last month about the approval of Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine for only seniors ages 65 and older and others with at least one underlying condition down to age 12 outline a rationale similar to the one Prasad used in his decision about the Novavax shot.",
      "\"The review team has done a commendable job in summarizing and analyzing the submission to date. Nevertheless, I disagree with certain aspects of their conclusions and instead reach the conclusion described below,\" Prasad wrote in his memo for Moderna's approval, dated May 30 and titled \"CENTER DIRECTOR OVERRIDE MEMO.\"",
      "The New York Times previously reported that the FDA had released the documents. Trade publication Pink Sheet previously reported that Prasad and his aides had blocked agency plans to grant a broad license for Novavax's vaccine, delaying its approval.",
      "Under Marks, Prasad's predecessor, it was uncommon but not unheard of for the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to intervene in the decisions to green-light vaccines. But it is virtually unprecedented for the FDA commissioner or his political appointees to step in to directly intervene or question traditional approval decisions, FDA officials have said.",
      "\"The tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level,\" Dr. Robert Califf, then the FDA commissioner under the Biden administration, had said at an event last year.",
      "In past criticism of the agency, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has often cited a move by Marks to green-light booster shots during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the ouster of two top career vaccines officials, who questioned the decision. One of those former FDA officials \u2014 Dr. Phil Krause \u2014 is also now criticizing moves by Makary and his aides as threatening to erode the agency's credibility.",
      "Agency leaders under Kennedy have made other unprecedented moves in recent months to wrest control over the nation's vaccines process.",
      "Months before Kennedy fired the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with his own picks, the FDA replaced the career official who usually works as liaisons to the CDC panel with Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg.",
      "Hoeg is the special assistant to the FDA commissioner. Along with Makary, Hoeg questioned the agency's approach to approving vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which has largely replaced the agency's career media relations staff who were mostly laid off in April, rejected the characterization of Prasad overruling FDA scientists as \"a distortion of the facts.\"",
      "\"He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That's not political \u2014 it's what principled leadership looks like,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said the FDA \"will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision-making,\" echoing frustrations voiced by Prasad and others picked by Kennedy about using long COVID to justify vaccine approvals, backing boosters for healthy young adults and the desire to bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other countries.",
      "Makary and Prasad also made this argument in May, after they announced a new \"framework\" that would limit all COVID-19 vaccine approvals to only seniors and others at-risk, unless vaccine makers were able to generate new clinical trial data.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won't. That's how trust in science is rebuilt,\" the HHS spokesperson said.",
      "The FDA's approvals decide whether vaccinemakers are allowed to sell their shots in the U.S. market at all. Those approvals are usually followed by CDC recommendations on how they should be used, which are influential because they are tied to federal policies that enable access to vaccines, like guaranteeing insurance coverage.",
      "Health care providers are also allowed to give vaccines \"off-label\" outside of the FDA's label and CDC recommendations, once the FDA has approved sales, though that risks running afoul of insurance coverage and liability protections.",

    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas.

    "summary": "From the Clotilda to the Titanic, archaeologist James Delgado shares insights from his 50-year career.",
    "story": [
      "Renowned underwater archaeologist James Delgado appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday to discuss his new book, \"The Great Museum of the Sea,\" and reflect on more than 50 years of searching for historic shipwrecks around the world.",
      "Delgado, who has investigated more than 100 shipwrecks globally, gained international attention in 2019 when he discovered the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States. The discovery was later featured in a \"60 Minutes\" segment with Anderson Cooper.",
      "The archaeologist's fascination with shipwrecks began in childhood while growing up in the San Francisco Bay area, where he learned about ships from the 1849 Gold Rush. He said locating shipwrecks requires extensive preparation.",
      "\"It takes a team. And that team includes oceanographers, people that understand currents. We're also looking at old records and charts. You're also trying to understand the forensics of it,\" he said.",
      "The process involves analyzing factors like ship speed and sailing patterns. Once located, the wrecks often don't match popular expectations.",
      "\"We have great images that people think of as shipwrecks, but there are a pile of rockets and timber and anchor, and then you go, all right, what exactly am I looking at here,\" he said.",
      "In his book, Delgado describes the sea as \"the largest museum on Earth\" and argues that every shipwreck has a story to tell.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for people to remember about shipwrecks is that it's okay for them to have different meanings,\" Delgado said. \"Some people like them because they inspire you with the stories of bravery. Others are tragic and sad. For some, they're the graves of family. But for others, they're a great opportunity to dive and to explore.\"",
      "The archaeologist has also explored the Titanic, describing the experience as overwhelming despite the ship's fame.",
      "\"Nothing prepares you for seeing 'Titanic,'\" he said.",
      "After a 2.5-hour descent in a Russian submersible, with pressure so intense that \"a regular styrofoam coffee cup gets squeezed down\" when strapped to the outside, Delgado said the anticipation suddenly disappeared when the ship appeared.",
      "\"There it was looming out of the darkness,\" he recalled. \"This massive hull rising twice as high as the ceiling here. Still painted but streaked with rust and rusticles that are orange and yellow and red. And then a porthole that's open and another closed.\"",
      "Delgado described one particularly eerie moment: \"One of the spookiest moments \u2014 because 'Titanic' is a ship of the dead \u2014 is when I first looked through the porthole, 2.5 miles down, the lights \u2014 I could see a face looking back at me in the porthole. It was my own reflection.\"",
      "He reflected on the ship's enduring power: \"This ship sitting on the bottom ruined and deteriorating still is the stage upon which some of the most powerful drama played out that we all know about with the shipwreck. And you're there.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:17:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The move is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from the New World screwworm fly, which could devastate its beef industry and even kill household pets.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\"It's an exceptionally good technology,\" said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \"It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\"",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of\u00a0the New World Screwworm fly.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "Threats to the beef industry",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\"A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\" said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\"It smelled nasty,\" he said. \"Like rotting meat.\"",
      "Scientists plan to use the fly's biology against it",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Why does the U.S. want to breed more flies?",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "Raising hundreds of millions of flies",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \"You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Risks associated with dropping flies from an airplane",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \"Whiz Packer.\"",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's \"crowning achievements.\"",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\"Something we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\" Burgess said.",

    "summary": "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued no later than July 31, according to a message posted by NOAA.",
    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

      "Massive rain hit at just the wrong time, in a flood-prone place",
      "The floods grew to their worst at the midpoint of a long holiday weekend when many people were asleep.",
      "The Texas Hill Country in the central part of the state is naturally prone to flash flooding due to the dry dirt-packed areas where the soil lets rain skid along the surface of the landscape instead of soaking it up. Friday's flash floods started with a particularly bad storm that dropped most of its 12 inches of rain in the dark early morning hours.",
      "After a flood watch notice midday Thursday, the National Weather Service office issued an urgent warning around 4 a.m. that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life.

      "Rice, Kerrville's city manager, explained how the Guadalupe River flooded so quickly.",
      "\"When you look at the headwaters of the Guadalupe... there's a north and a south fork,\" Rice said Friday night. \"Since 1987, under normal conditions, if you can call it that, you'll hit water in one of those areas, and those two forks will converge into the Guadalupe, which comes through the city of Kerrville.\"",
      "\"This rain event sat on top of that and dumped more rain than what was forecasted on both of those forks,\" Rice continued. \"When we got the report, it was about 7 feet or so on the south fork, and within a matter of minutes it was up to 29 feet, and all of that converged at Guadalupe.\"",

    "story": [
      "The White House is set to put pressure on the U.S.'s trading partners this week to sign new tariff deals, with the hope that they will be finalized before a Wednesday deadline.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to send dozens of letters to countries that have not made a trade deal, warning them that higher tariffs could kick in Aug. 1, White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday.",
      "\"Our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners,\"\u00a0Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0\"And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.\"",
      "As many as 15 letters will be going out beginning Monday, President Trump confirmed to reporters before heading back to the White House from his New Jersey club on Sunday. Some will go out on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said, adding that \"some deals have been made.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wrote later on social media that \"Letters, and/or Deals, with various Countries from around the World\" would start being delivered at 12:00 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "\"Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff,\" Mr. Trump wrote in another post, referring to an alliance of nations with emerging economies, which held a summit in Brazil over the weekend. \"There will be no exceptions to this policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "Initially comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the group now also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Mr. Trump did not specify what exactly would trigger the added BRICS tariff.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also told reporters Sunday that higher tariffs could go into effect Aug. 1 for countries that don't make a deal by Wednesday.",
      "Questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether Mr. Trump will once more push off imposing the rates.",
      "In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Bessent said about 100 letters will be sent to small countries \"where we don't have very much trade\" and where tariffs are already at the baseline of 10%. The treasury secretary also said that the administration is primarily focused on nations with the largest trade deficit with the U.S.",
      "\"There are 18 important trading relationships that account for 95% of our deficit, and those are the ones we're concentrating on,\" Bessent said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was a new deadline and declined to say what might happen Wednesday.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Bessent said on CNN's State of the Union. \"I'm not going to give away the playbook.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers say he could extend the time for dealmaking but they insist the administration is applying maximum pressure on other nations. Hassett said that Trump would decide when it was time to give up on negotiations.",
      "Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, likewise said countries negotiating in good faith and making concessions could \"sort of, get the date rolled.\"",
      "The\u00a0steeper tariffs\u00a0that Trump announced April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "With the freeze on\u00a0sweeping U.S. tariffs\u00a0set to expire Wednesday, July 9, the White House\u00a0has touted new trade agreements with countries in recent weeks, like China, the U.K. and Vietnam.\u00a0But there are still questions heading into the week with other deals yet to be announced.",
      "Bessent said the U.S. was \"close to several deals,\" and predicted several big announcements over the next few days. He gave no details.",
      "\"I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent said.",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS News' MoneyWatch.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced a deal with Vietnam. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. would levy 20% tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam, and a 40% tariff on \"any transshipping.\" The president said Vietnam would \"'OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,' meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.\"",
      "That was a decline from the 46% tax on Vietnamese imports he proposed in April \u2014 one of his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting dozens of countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit.",
      "Asked if he expected to reach deals with the\u00a0European Union\u00a0or India, Trump said Friday that \"letters are better for us\" because there are so many countries involved.",
      "\"We have India coming up and with Vietnam, we did it, but much easier to send a letter saying, 'Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And this is what you're going to have to pay if you want to do business in the United States.\"",
      "Canada, however, will not be one of the countries receiving letters, Trump's ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, said Friday after trade talks between the two countries recently resumed.",
      "\"Canada is one of our biggest trading partners,\" Hoekstra told CTV News in an interview in Ottawa. \"We're going to have a deal that's articulated.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he wants a new deal in place by July 21 or Canada will increase trade countermeasures.",
      "Hoekstra would not commit to a date for a trade agreement and said even with a deal, Canada could still face some tariffs. But \"we're not going to send Canada just a letter,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering in his federal trial in New York, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America.",
      "Combs, 55, was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution, but was acquitted on the most serious charges, which carried potential life-in-prison sentences.",
      "\"They all said: 'We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'\" attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after the jury reached its verdict.",
      "The music mogul remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on the prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time served, which currently amounts to almost 10 months.",
      "After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"I said: 'Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'\" he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. \"They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.\"",
      "Blunt trial strategy works",
      "The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.",
      "The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.",
      "\"You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, \"is simply not sex trafficking.\"",
      "Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,\" he said.",
      "Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.",
      "\"No one knows what to think,\" Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.",
      "Morning surprise awakes lawyer",
      "\"I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: \"We have to get a bail application together,\" he recalled. \"It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.\"",
      "He said he \"kind of whipped everybody into feeling better\" after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.",
      "Agnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.",
      "The seemingly chastened Combs mouthed \"thank you\" to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: \"Dream Team! Dream Team!\" Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.",
      "\"This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,\" said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited \"a dream team of defense lawyers\" against prosecutors who almost always win.",
      "Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy \u2014 belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them \u2014 last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the \"federal government comes into our bedrooms,\" he said.",
      "Lawyers gently questioned most witnesses",
      "During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.",
      "Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team \"had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. That's masterful.\"",
      "Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.",
      "\"I knew the weak points in the statute,\" he said. \"The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.\"",
      "He said prosecutors had \"dozens of fail points.\"",
      "\"They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,\" he said. \"They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.\"",
      "Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.",
      "Once freed, Combs likely to reenter domestic abusers program",
      "For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.",
      "\"He's doing OK,\" said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.",
      "He said Combs genuinely desires improvement and \"realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.\"",
      "\"He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune\" that can erase them,\" he said. \"You can't cover them up.\"",
      "For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom.",
      "\"I'm like: 'What the hell?'\" recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures.",
      "Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse.",
      "\"We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. It was crazy. I was worried about him,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk is floating a new political party dubbed the \"America Party\" \u2014 but the idea could face major hurdles.",
    "story": [
      "As billionaire Elon Musk feuds with President Trump over his signature tax and domestic policy legislation, Musk has reupped his calls to launch a new political party \u2014 a daunting task even for the wealthiest person on Earth.",
      "Musk first floated launching a third party, dubbed the \"America Party,\" earlier this month, part of a nasty back-and-forth between the president and the Tesla CEO that marked the likely end of their political alliance. The billionaire raised the idea of a third party again last week as lawmakers raced to send the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Mr. Trump's desk \u2014 saying he would start the party if Congress passed what he\u00a0described as\u00a0an \"insane spending bill.\"",
      "On Saturday, a day after Mr. Trump signed the bill into law, Musk wrote in a social media post that the \"America Party\" had formed after\u00a0polling his followers on X.",
      "\"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!\" Musk said in the post. \"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.  Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Mr. Trump reacted to the idea of Musk's new party, saying it would cause \"total disruption and chaos.\" The president also said Musk is \"off the rails\" and was \"becoming a train wreck\" over the past five weeks.",
      "Musk did not offer any other details on the formation of the \"America Party\" this weekend, and it's unclear what steps he has taken so far.",
      "Since Musk decided to launch a new political party, he'll need to contend with a thicket of complicated state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules and intense litigation.",
      "\"Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,\" Brett Kappel, a veteran election lawyer, told CBS News last week.",
      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Musk wrote on X Friday\u00a0that a nascent political party could \"laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,\" arguing, \"that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws.\" On Sunday, Musk said he initially plans to focus on congressional races, but\u00a0\"Backing a candidate for president is not out of the question.\"",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process of forming a new national party is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge the issues himself on Sunday, saying Musk \"even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States - The System seems not designed for them.\"",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired in late June. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said Sunday on Truth Social that Musk previously told him that he \"had no problems\" with the elimination of the electric vehicle mandate, \"which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time.\"",

      "Peter Hardin, a defense attorney who was representing Park, told CBS News that Park's parents \"were able to locate and recover Daniel's body\" but his family has not been notified about an official cause of death. As Park's death in federal custody is being investigated as a possible death by suicide, other attorneys have raised questions about the L.A. lockup.",
      "A U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesperson declined to answer questions about the investigation of Park's death.",
      "Park had arrived at the L.A. detention center on June 13. His death at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles was confirmed by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons on June 24, but authorities have not disclosed the cause. The death of the 32-year-old has shuttered the federal criminal prosecution and thickens the cloud of mystery surrounding the May 17 bombing attack at the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California.",
      "The alleged bomber and Park's alleged co-conspirator, 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, was killed in the bombing, the FBI said. Four people were injured in the explosion.",
      "Park was accused of shipping approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to be used by Bartkus. He was charged with Attempting to Provide Material Support to Terrorists, Conspiracy to manufacture unregistered destructive devices and aiding and abetting the manufacture of unregistered destructive devices.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Park and Bartkus shared extremist views. In a charging document, the Justice Department said, \"Bartkus's attack was motivated by his pro-mortalism, anti-natalism, and anti-pro-life ideology, which is the belief that individuals should not be born without their consent and that non-existence is best.\"",
      "Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said Bartkus had \"nihilistic ideations\" and investigators believe he was attempting to livestream the bombing.",

      "Immigration lawyers in California told CBS News last month that they have been receiving increasing calls about unmet medical needs at the detention center.

      "I want to start with trade, because there's a big deadline coming up on Wednesday, as you know. That 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs that the president announced back in April is set to end. So far, the U.S. has announced a few deals, the U.K., Vietnam, and you're inching closer to a final agreement with China.",
      "Do you expect to get any more deals done with America's biggest trading partners by Wednesday?",

      "First, I do have to take a pause and share your thoughts and prayers with the people of Texas. It's an incredible, heartbreaking story. And Kristi Noem and the president have instructed the federal government to throw everything they have got at helping the survivors and helping clean up that place.",

      "On trade, there's going to be quite a bit of news this week. And I think the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized. There are a whole number that Jamieson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments. And then there are going to be letters that are sent to countries saying, here's how we think it ought to go because the deals aren't advanced enough.",
      "And the headline is going to be that countries are agreeing around the world to open their markets up to our products and to allow us to put some kind of tariff on their products when they come into the U.S. And exactly what the numbers will be will be things that you will find out in the news this week.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And, Kevin, you said there are going to be deals.",
      "For those really important trading partners, if there's not a deal by Wednesday, is the president going to extend this pause?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: You know, the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world. And there are deadlines and there are things that are close. And so maybe things will push back the dead \u2013 past the deadline, or maybe they won't.",
      "In the end, the president is going to make that judgment.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And you also mentioned those letters that will start going out tomorrow, according to President Trump. He said about 10 to 12 countries will receive them.",
      "Do you \u2013 can you tell us who's going to get one and what they say?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: I'm sorry, I can't, because \u2013 because, again, the part of the letter that could be happening, right, is that we're close to a deal, we're not really satisfied with the progress that we're making in the deal, and so we're saying, OK, fine we're going to send a letter, but maybe you get a deal at the last minute too.",
      "Until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Is it fair to say that those notices are going to go to our smaller trading partners, as you negotiate with our bigger ones?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: I think that it could be that it'll be both.",
      "But also don't forget that, when we have great trade deals, our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners. And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I have to ask you about the deadlines, Kevin, to make these deals, because you just mentioned you're always open. The president said there's not really any flexibility left between now and Wednesday.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said that deals would be wrapped up by Labor Day. So I wonder if \u2013 how can companies plan if the goalposts keep moving? How can countries negotiate if they don't even know how much time they have left?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well, the rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear to everybody, because we have some deals, like the U.K. and the Vietnam deal, that are starting to be, I guess, guidelines for what might happen.",
      "But one of the things that we're seeing that's really interesting to me is that people are just onshoring production to the U.S. at a record rate. And so we have had record job creation, record capital spending. And this is even ahead of the Big Beautiful Bill. And so I think what's happening is that people are responding to President Trump's potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the U.S., which is creating jobs, more than two million jobs since he took office, and raising wages.",
      "You know, wage growth is heading up towards the really, really high pinnacles that we saw in 2017. And so I think there's a race right now to get activity into the U.S. And, in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I remember, after these reciprocal tariffs were announced, you told me that there are about 15 deals that countries were bringing to the president.",
      "How close \u2013 if you could give us any number at all, what number are we going to see this week?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, you will have \u2013 you will have to get that from Jamieson and the president. I think that we have seen lots of deals that have been finalized by negotiators, and then the president finds things that can make them better.",
      "And so it's \u2013 I'm not going to get ahead of the president on the number of deals.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK, thanks, Kevin. We will look out for that.",
      "I want to move now to the One Big Beautiful Bill that\u2026",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: \u2026 of course, the president signed into law on Independence Day.",
      "You have it, and now you have to pay for it. And there's a consensus that this bill adds tremendously to the deficit. I know that you are so familiar with these numbers. The Yale Budget Lab estimates it will add $3 trillion to the debt. The Tax Foundation says this tax portion of the bill could also add $3 trillion to the deficit.",
      "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which factors an interest on the debt, says it could add up to $5 trillion over the next decade. And on this very program, even Speaker Johnson answered in the affirmative when asked if this bill would add over $4 trillion to the deficit.",
      "I know that the administration says the bill will actually shrink the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Help me understand\u2026",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: \u2026 why there is such a drastic difference between your numbers and all those others.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Well \u2013 well, first of all, let's remember that science is not democracy. Truth is not democracy.",
      "Our estimates are based on modeling that we used last time when I was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to say what would happen if we had a bill, how much growth we would get. And we said \u2013 and we were criticized soundly \u2013 that we would get 3 percent growth.",
      "And we even had the really technical macroeconomic models that said that we would get 3 percent growth. We run the same models through this tax bill, it's even better. And what we're seeing is that, if you get 3 percent growth again, then that's $4 trillion more in revenue than the CBO and these other bodies are giving us credit for.",
      "They have been wrong in the past, and they're being wrong again, in our belief. But the thing that disappoints me is that, if I put out a model and I say, hey, here's what's going to happen, we're going to get 3 percent growth, and then it turns out it's 1.5 percent growth, then, as an academic economist, as a scientist, then it's my duty to say, what did I get wrong? What did my model miss?",
      "These people aren't doing that. And that's the thing that I find disappointing, because we put peer-reviewed academic stuff on the table and said, we're going to get that 3 percent growth, and then we got it right last time. And we believe we're going to get it right this time.",
      "But if you think that 1.8 percent growth is what's going to happen over the next 10 years, then you should agree with the CBO number. But there's another part of the CBO number that you need to worry about. And that is that, if we don't pass the bill, then it's the biggest tax hike in history.",
      "And with that big tax hike, then, of course, we would have a recession. The CEA says that we'd have about a 4 percent drop in GDP and lose nine million jobs. If we had a 4 percent drop in GDP and we lost nine billion jobs, what would happen to the deficit?",
      "And so I don't think that the CBO has a very strong record. I don't think these places have a very strong record. And what they need to do is get back to the basics of looking at macroeconomic models. There's a really famous macroeconomist in Harvard named Jim Stock. They should go back and read everything Jim Stock has written for the last 15 years and fold those into their models, and then maybe we could talk.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to talk to you, Kevin, about another number that I know you and the president disagree with, but that Democrats and many Republicans are worried about.",
      "And that's the CBO's projection that as many as 12 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage because of this law. What is the NEC's estimate for how many people could lose coverage?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yes, let's unbundle that a little bit, because, first, on the CBO coverage, so what are we doing?",
      "So what we're doing is, we're asking for a work requirement, but the work requirement is that you need to be looking for work or even doing volunteer work, and you don't need to do it until your kids are 14 or older. And so the idea that that's going to cause a massive hemorrhaging in availability of insurance doesn't make a lot of sense to us.",
      "And then, if you look at the CBO numbers, if you look at the big numbers they say that people are going to lose insurance, about five million of those are people who have other insurance. There are people who have two types of insurance. And so, therefore, if they lose one, they're still insured.",
      "And so the CBO numbers on that side don't make any sense to us at all, but, on the other side, go back to 2017, when we had work requirements for Obamacare, and they said that we'd lose about four million insured between 2017 and 2019, and about double that over the next 10 years. And, in fact, the number of insured went up, went up quite a bit, by more than 10 million, over those two years, because the bottom line is, the best way to get insurance is to get a job.",
      "And we have got a Big Beautiful Bill that's going to create a lot of job creation and a lot of insurance. And the CBO is just not accounting for that.",
      "And, again, they need to go back and look at all the things that they got wrong. You realize that they're underestimating Medicaid spending by 20 percent. They should look back at all the things they got wrong and explain what they're going to do to get it right in the future and to do a better job. And if they do that, we will take them more seriously.",
      "But, right now, I don't think any serious thinker could take them seriously, because they have done so wrong \u2013 been so wrong for so long. Even back \u2013 if you go back to when President Obama passed Obamacare, they got every single number there wrong about how many people would get private insurance and how few people would get Medicaid and so on.",
      "And so their record in this modeling space is about as bad as it's possible to be. In fact, you could kind of roll the roulette wheel and come up with a better set of numbers, a better history, track record history, than CBO.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, Kevin, what about the enhanced subsidies? Is that number wrong too, that the ACA allows about $705 for people to help pay for their health insurance?",
      "That doesn't sound like the waste, fraud and abuse that I know you and the president have talked about eliminating. That just sounds like people who cannot afford coverage, and now it's going to be even more so with these subsidies gone.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well \u2013 well, what \u2013 what \u2013 if you're \u2013 if you're looking at the \u2013 the change in the tax on the providers, which is something that has been a key talking point for the Democrats, they say that that's going to close down rural hospitals, what has happened is that, rather than let the states \u2013 the states have this game where they give a dollar to a hospital, and then the federal government matches the dollar, and then the state taxes some of the dollar away.",
      "In other words, that we have an agreement with the states that they're going to match, but then they have this trick where they tax the hospitals after they give them money, so really it's the federal government giving them money. And that's why we have been overspending Medicaid by 20 percent since this trick started happening.",
      "And so what we have done is that we have put a haircut on that, but we have also put $50 billion into a trust fund to make sure that the rural hospitals are there to treat the sick.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: And so I think this is a prudent reform. It's sound budgetary politics, and I think that nobody's going to lose their insurance.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Kevin Hassett, we will watch for how that ages.",
      "Thank you very much. Really appreciate your time.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: And if I get it wrong, we will check and we will talk about why I got it wrong, I promise.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK.",
      "Thank you. We will have you back. Thank you very much, Kevin.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Thanks, Weijia Jiang.",
      "We now turn to Congressman \u2013 Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We turn now to New York Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi.",
      "Congressman, thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-New York): Yes, thanks so much for having me.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, you just heard from Kevin Hassett.",
      "You know, like President Trump, he said, without this bill, it would be one of the greatest tax hikes for the American public. They say it is the greatest tax cut in American history.",
      "You sit on the Ways and Means Committee, so I have to wonder how you describe it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I describe it as the big, ugly bill, not the Big Beautiful Bill.",
      "It's going to do a lot of things that are going to hurt a lot of people in our country. The biggest one, which you talked about with Mr. Hassett, is increase the deficit enormously in the country. And what that does is, that creates inflation, that keeps interest rates high, that makes it hard for people to buy homes, makes it hard for them to borrow money to do the things that they want to do.",
      "In addition, it's going to knock a bunch of people off of health care. We know that the Republicans have tried for a decade to undo the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, and this is kind of a backdoor way to take health insurance away from people that really need it the most here in our nation.",
      "And it's going to cause health insurance costs to go up for a lot of people. One of the president's biggest issues he campaigned on was reducing prices rapidly. On day one, we're going to cut the costs.",
      "Well, costs are not going down. Inflation \u2013 inflation is going to be affected by this deficit. Interest rates are going to stay high, and this is going to have a negative impact on health insurance costs for many people in our country.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I know that you just brought up Medicaid and potential loss of coverage. What do you say to some Americans who might wonder, well, why should the able-bodied not have to work in order to access Medicaid?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, you have to understand that 92 percent of the people that are able to work are currently working, and the 8 percent that are not are often people that are taking care of disabled children.",
      "Remember that two-thirds of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. One-tenth of all the veterans in the United States of America are on Medicaid. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many people that are facing such difficult circumstances that we can't even possibly imagine.",
      "And why would we be taking health insurance and food benefits away from some of the most needy Americans, while we're providing what I believe is an unnecessary tax break for some of the wealthiest Americans? It just doesn't make sense that you're reducing taxes for some of the wealthiest people, hurting some of the lowest-income people, while blowing the biggest deficit in the budget that we've had in the history of the country.",
      "Those things just don't add up.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, just last week, you said you agree with 75 percent of what's in this package. That's a pretty significant number. So why isn't it worth the 25 percent that you don't like?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because those things that I just mentioned are so devastating.",
      "I like the idea that we're investing more money to secure the border. I like the idea that we are paying \u2013 providing tax breaks to lower-income folks and hardworking middle class folks and people aspiring to the middle class.",
      "I like the idea of providing tax breaks for those folks. But why are we providing \u2013 and when the economy is doing as well as it has been over the past several years, why would we be providing a tax decrease, tax breaks for some of the wealthiest Americans in our country, while blowing a massive hole in the deficit?",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Congressman, I want to turn to an op-ed that you wrote in \"The Wall Street Journal\" last week saying Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City's Democratic mayoral primary should be a \u2013 quote \u2013 \"loud wakeup call for Democrats.\"",
      "What lessons do you think your party can learn from \u2013 from his campaign?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, you know, I disagree with Mr. Mamdani. I have to make that very clear that, you know, I'm a Democratic capitalist. I'm not a Democratic socialist.",
      "And \u2013 but you have to recognize that he tapped into something. He tapped into the same thing that Donald Trump tapped into, which is that people are concerned that the economy is not working for them. Affordability and the economy is the number one issue in the country.",
      "And, too often, Democrats are not perceived as being focused on affordability and the economy and the middle class, and people aspiring to the middle class and their economic concerns. They see Democrats as being primarily focused on reproductive rights and on LGBT protections, which are important issues, but they're not the issues that people think about every night when they're lying in bed thinking about paying their bills or when they're talking about how they're going to send their kids to school.",
      "So Democrats have got to do a better job learning from both Trump and Mamdani, not with their solutions, which I think are wrong, but with the diagnosis of the problem, that we're frustrated, we're concerned. Everybody in America, whether you're a right-wing conservative or a left-wing progressive, should believe that, in return for working hard, you make enough money so you can live a good life.",
      "You can buy a home, you can educate your children, you can pay for your health insurance, you can retire one day without being scared. People don't feel that currently, and we have to do a better job of communicating that.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, I'm glad you brought up the perception, because you also wrote that Democrats must recognize the future starts with a message of economic security for American families.",
      "I covered the Biden campaign. I covered the Harris campaign. That was the center of their messages. So what's the problem here? Is it the messenger? Is it the messaging? Because they have that message already.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: It's a combination.",
      "Number one, the Democratic Party as a whole has to have this platform that focuses on what the people care about. They care about the economy. They care about immigration. They care about taxes. They care about crime. They care about health care.",
      "But then we have to recognize that the media infrastructure is fractured. And Trump figured it out before the Democrats have, which is that it's not just traditional media, like your shows and newspapers, but it's social media. It's podcasts.",
      "Podcasts, the top 500 podcasts in America, 400 of the top 500 are right- leaning, 100 are left-leaning, and of the 100 left-leaning ones, half of them beat the you-know what out of the Democrats. Then you have other national media, and then you have some of this ethnic and underground media related to WeChat and WhatsApp and different types of apps that people use.",
      "So we have to communicate across all those platforms, because people are getting their messages in these fractured environments and living in these echo chambers. And we have to do a better job communicating across all these platforms and getting Democrats as a whole to focus on the economy, immigration, et cetera.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: All right, Congressman, we are all trying to learn all those new languages. Thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "A day ahead of America's 249th birthday, \"CBS EVENING NEWS\" co-anchor John Dickerson met up with filmmaker and historian Ken Burns at Monticello, Virginia, the home of our third president, Thomas Jefferson. Burns has a new film out this November on PBS entitled \"The American Revolution,\" and he gave us a preview.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You call the \u2013 the revolutionary period a civil war.",
      "KEN BURNS (Documentary Filmmaker): It is.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Was that always your conception of the \u2013",
      "KEN BURNS: No.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How did you come to think of it that way?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think because there's no photographs and there's no news reels and they're in, you know, stockings and breaches and powdered wigs there's a sense of distance from them. I think we also are so proud, rightfully, of the power of the big ideas that we \u2013 we just don't want to get into the fact that it was this bloody civil war, patriots against loyalists, disaffected people, native people, enslaved and free people within it, foreign powers that are in \u2013 ultimately engaged in this. This is a big world war by the end.",
      "I think we \u2013 we \u2013 we perhaps are fearful that those big ideas are diminished and they're not in any way. They're, in fact, become even more inspiring, that they emerge from the turmoil.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How should we think about the Declaration of Independence this period in America in our present day?",
      "KEN BURNS: First of all, I think the American Revolution is the most important event since the birth of Christ in all of world history.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Why?",
      "KEN BURNS: I mean it turned the world upside down, which is the cliche. Before this moment, everyone was a subject. Essentially under the rule of somebody else. We had created in this moment a very brand-new thing called a citizen. And this has had powerful effects. It's going to set in motion revolutions for the next two plus centuries all around the world, all attempting to sort of give a new expression to this idea that all men are created equal, that they're endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. And that's a big, big deal in world history.",
      "So, what happens here is I suppose you could, you know, miss the point and say it's a quarterfinal between Englishmen, but it is the beginning of something absolutely new in the world. And \u2013 and that is something to celebrate. And to understand, too, that it comes out of so much division that's going on between the states. People in New Hampshire and Georgia are \u2013 they're \u2013 they're from different countries. They believe different things, that you could have the divisions of \u2013 of loyalists and patriots, you could have this \u2013 all the \u2013 the things that are rolling in these colonies and understand that out of that we could still figure out a way to come together.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Americans think they're pretty divided right now. They weren't nearly as divided as they were during the revolutionary period.",
      "KEN BURNS: Here is the simple thing. We're always divided. So, it \u2013 it ebbs and flows a little bit, but we're always have big differences.",
      "You know, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal is not met with universal approval. The Civil War kills 750,000 Americans we think over the issue of slavery. We have our own revolution. There are lot of periods. The Vietnam period, when we're so particularly divided.",
      "So, I think there's a little bit of chicken little, you know, oh, the sky is falling because now things are always worse now than they ever were. The only \u2013 the reason why historians, and God knows I'm an amateur historian, feel a kind of optimism is because there's something familiar. There's, you know, the Bible says there's nothing new under the sun, human nature essentially doesn't change, and that's true.",
      "What's great about the revolution is, for a moment things actually \u2013 there was something new in the world. And that's the thing that we need to use. That's the leverage we have to bring us back to the ability to speak to one another, to understand how you solve your differences, as opposed to the sort of soup of anger and \u2013 and distrust that seemed to be, you know, everywhere now.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What is a citizen's obligation now?",
      "KEN BURNS: A citizen's obligation now is the same as it's ever been. And that's the most important thing. There's a wonderful phrase, a little bit later from the famous words, where Jefferson says, \"all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable.\" Meaning, we all kind of have gravitated to be under authoritarian rule. You know, the trains running on time, or we get at least this. But we're going to require of you to be a citizen something more. It's got to be active.",
      "The pursuit of happiness is not the acquisition of things in a marketplace of objects, but lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. That's what the founders said. To be virtuous, to live a virtuous life, to continually educate yourself is what was required to sustain this republic. And I think that's what we've gotten away from. Everything is sort of all individualized. We're all free agents. We don't realize that freedom, the thing that we tout, is not just what I want, but also that's intention with what we need.",
      "And I think what happens is that when we study these words, we can go back to the sense of newness and freshness that they represented and rededicate ourselves. And that means me, for me, and you for you, to this idea that the pursuit of happiness is about lifelong learning. It's about becoming ever more educated to the responsibility of citizenship. And that's a huge, huge responsibility. Not just to take your feed, not just to go with the flow, not just to get your information that \u2013 that sort of ratifies what you already thought, but to actually explore what my neighbor thinks.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Being an American, as Jefferson saw it, as the founders saw it, was a continuing obligation to engage with its history.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right. And \u2013 and this is really important, in order to form the government, they had to reach back through the middle ages, through the dark ages, back to antiquity, to bring up these ideas like virtue and temperance and moderation and all of the things that all of them were looking for.",
      "I mean, the amazing things is, we're here at Thomas Jefferson's house, but we don't have a country without his words, but also we don't have a country without George Washington. And yet we know about all of these men. They're deeply flawed, in many important ways. And I think today, in our binary culture, you know, where everything's a one or a zero, or it's a red state or a blue state, it's my way or the highway, we've forgotten that it's possible to tolerate, as we do among \u2013 with the people we love, their strengths and their weaknesses.",
      "So, heroism is not perfection if we can take an historical view that permits us to see a Jefferson and a Washington in \u2013 in these very complicated understanding of them, then it's possible to then breathe, to have some room to understand who we are now, who we were then, and where we might be, which is, of course, the most important thing. All the anxiety about this present moment is really not so much about the present moment, but about, will we survive.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Can you talk about the genius and brilliance of his words without sitting right in the middle Jefferson's owning of slaves, enslaved people?",
      "KEN BURNS: No. I think this is the important thing. And somehow we've \u2013 we've gotten to the idea that you just don't want to mess with the good stuff and let's just pretend \u2013 pay no attention to that man behind the \u2013 you can't do that. A good story is a good story is a good story. And this is a really good part of the story. It's complicated. It's dark. There are human beings in this house who are owned by a person who has articulated universal rights for everyone. And what's so great is that the vagueness of the words has allowed everybody to plow through and make it their own. Not just here, but all around the stuff.",
      "So \u2013 so, when he says \"pursuit of happiness,\" that may be the key word. When we say a \"more perfect union\" in the Constitution later on, that may be the key word, that this is a process that we're engaged in. And so maybe the \u2013 the poetry, but also the vagueness of the words have opened a door that have \u2013 have \u2013 have allowed women to come through, that have allowed enslaved people to have citizenship, that have expanded in so many different ways. And all around the world, that that's \u2013 this is progress.",
      "And so, I think going back and understanding them for the deep undertow that's present, and sometimes really discomforting undertow about it, is OK. It's \u2013 nothing is diminished. Don't make a Madison Avenue version of - - of \u2013 of our past, but celebrate the grittiness. And I think in this case, the violence of the American Revolution, we do a service to those ideas that we think need to be protected. I mean, with \u2013 this is not ideas that are fixed in amber, you know, this is \u2013 this is \u2013 this is gritty, gritty stuff. People died. Lots of people died fighting for this in \u2013 in just horrific struggles when the main form of killing was a bayonet. That's not fun.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: President Trump has issued an executive in which he says basically history has gotten out of balance as of the American government, either funds it through museums or national parks, and he said instead that \u2013 that this federal role in history should instead \"focus on the greatness of the achievements and the progress of the American people.\"",
      "So, President Trump thinks there's an imbalance in the way we talk about history. How do you see that?",
      "KEN BURNS: I don't see the imbalance. I think we need to celebrate the greatness of the American people. The greatness of the American people comes from telling these compensated stories. And \u2013 and \u2013 and that's a good story is a good story is a good story. That's what you're looking for. You don't want to just say is, otherwise it's just sort of slogans that are \u2013 that are put up on the wall.",
      "We want to feel that we know who Thomas Jefferson is. We need to understand the internal struggles that Abraham Lincoln had. We have to understand what was going through Rosa Parks' mind when she, you know, refused to give up her seat on the bus. This in no way take away from the glory (ph), it makes the story fuller and richer and \u2013 and permits purchase for everyone. You - - you want a \u2013 a history to be complicated because it gives everybody a chance to own or have access to it.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Diversity of voice in storytelling was important to you. That also is under assault at the moment. The president basically is trying to remove all efforts to keep diversity in mind. Is there something that is lost in that?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, you know, there's a strength in the wagon wheel of all the different spokes into the hub. We're all looking for the hub, whatever the hub is. Meaning, you know, something that pulls us together, that chorus. That's what we're all about.",
      "And so that \u2013 the strength of that wheel has to do with having the spokes and having a multitude of perspective. The impulse for some is to say there's only one perspective. And that's true of many different things. Sometimes say it's got to be only from this perspective. It's got to be Freudian or it's got to be Marxist economic or it's got to be symbolic or it's got to be, you know, post-modern, or whatever the thing is. You don't need that.",

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Going back to this idea of ongoing nourishment of history, part of, go back to the Revolution, to learn who we are now. Do you ever think of this work as an intervention?",
      "People don't re-read The Declaration every Fourth of July, as Thomas Jefferson wanted. People, in your telling, seem to have lost sight of some of the parts of our founding. Maybe we don't even know them because we've been told different kinds of stories. Is this an intervention?",
      "KEN BURNS: No. Intervention imposes between the storyteller, that would be us, and the story we're trying to tell and our audience, some sort of larger, high-fluting purpose. A good story is a good story is a good story. And that's all we're interested in doing.",
      "The Fourth of July is my favorite holiday because you sit there on a blanket, on a field, looking at these fireworks with all of these other people in the dark and you share with them in common that we agree to basically a sentence in a \u2013 in a \u2013 in a document, written, you know, by a Virginian who lived here, you know, 249 years ago. That's really powerful stuff.",
      "So, the fact that it can be misinterpreted by some, this is always going to be the case. Manipulated by others, this will always be the case. Sort of, you know, genuinely embraced but for the wrong reasons, this will always be the case. But we still, we know. We understand that we hold these truths to be self-evident, even though they weren't, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It doesn't get any better of that.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You've told a lot of your stories on PBS. PBS is under threat.",
      "KEN BURNS: All off them. All of them. All of them (INAUDIBLE).",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Are you worried about the future of PBS?",
      "KEN BURNS: Of course I am. And I've always been worried about it. In the 1990s, I think I testified in the House or the Senate, in appropriations or authorization about the endowments are about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting a half dozen times.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Make the case for PBS.",
      "KEN BURNS: It is the Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world. It's a bottom up. It's the largest network in the country. There's 330 stations. It mostly serves, and this is where the elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is so shortsighted, it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only they get. They also have not only our good children's and primetime stuff, they have Classroom of the Air continuing education, homeland security, crop reports, weather, emergency information. That we're going to take away? This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left wing thing when this is the place that for 32 years gave William F. Buckley a show. And it's \u2013 I mean it's \u2013 and it's - - that show is, by the way, is still going on and moderated by a conservative.",
      "So, I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And I couldn't do \u2013 let me personalize it. And I didn't want to. John, I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS. I \u2013 I could go into a streaming service or a premium cable tomorrow and get every one of the millions of dollars it took to do this in one pitch. But they wouldn't give me ten years. They want it in a year or a year and a half. And that's \u2013 I can't do that. Same with Vietnam. Same with the Civil War. Same with jazz. Same with the national parks. Same with, you know, the Roosevelts. All these \u2013 country music. All of those have taken time to incubate. And that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out. Kind of like the national parks, or the Declaration of Independence, applied to the landscape.",
      "These are really good, American institutions that represent everybody from the bottom up, which is what it's always about. That's the essence of what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: As someone who worked so hard on telling the story of slavery and enslaved people in various different ways, what did you learn about slavery in America from working on this?",
      "KEN BURNS: It's so complicated and so interesting. I \u2013 I think the thing that was most striking that's come to me is that it was really clear that our founders, even those founders who owned other human beings, knew that the institution of slavery was indefensible. It's only later in the 19th century that you'll sort of make \u2013 you try to make excuses for why it's OK. And that they're really wrestling with ways. But there are human beings that are owned by other human beings. It's very, very complicated. And you can never say a categorical them about anybody. And that's all we do.",
      "Look, I have \u2013 I have made films about the U.S. for all of my professional life. But I've also made films simultaneously about us. All of the intimacy of that and all the majesty and complexity and contradiction and controversy of the U.S. And the thing I've learned, if I've learned anything, is that there's only \"us.\" There's is no \"them.\" And we're constantly being told there's a them. There is no them.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: If there is only \"us,\" and no \"them,\" it is also a strain in American history, look at them, go get them.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's right. It's the simplest thing. It's the authoritarians' playbook.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: There's a lot of talk about \"them\" these days. Are you hoping to pierce that with this telling of America's beginning?",
      "KEN BURNS: I \u2013 I don't have a conscious desire to do this. This implies a kind of agenda, a kind of a political agenda.",
      "We consciously understand, as we're working on a film, how many \u2013 how much is rhyming in the present and it changes a little bit and changes that. But we don't ever try to put neon signs going, look how much this is so much like today. We just want to let that resonate. And you go, oh my goodness, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they may have wigs and they may have breaches. They're very much like us.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Because if you put too much of a thumb on the scale, you ruin the story and then you kill the power of the story.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right. You have to let it tell the story. Our job is to be a good storyteller, period, full stop, end of sentence.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Sunday that \"rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear\" ahead of a key tariff deadline this week, with agreements like the U.K. and Vietnam deals serving as \"guidelines for what might happen\" with other countries.",
      "\"There's going to be quite a bit of news this week, and I think the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "With President Trump's 90-day freeze on sweeping U.S. tariffs set to expire Wednesday, the White House has touted new trade agreements with countries in recent weeks, like China, the U.K. and Vietnam. But there are still questions heading into the week with other deals yet to be announced.",
      "The president on April 2 unveiled a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "Hassett said Sunday that there are a \"whole number\" of deals that U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments, along with letters to be sent to countries where \"deals aren't advanced enough\" this week. Mr. Trump told reporters Friday that the U.S. will start sending letters Monday to around a dozen countries.",
      "Though Hassett wouldn't share any details about the countries set to receive the letters, he said the notices could go to both small and large trading partners. Hassett outlined the possibility of getting a deal \"at the last minute\" with the letters, saying \"until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.\"",
      "Asked by senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang whether the president will extend the pause for some of the most important trading partners if deals don't come together by Wednesday, Hassett said \"the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world.\"",
      "\"There are deadlines, and there are things that are close, and so maybe things will push back past the deadline, or maybe they won't,\" Hassett said. \"In the end, the president's going to make that judgment.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday that he would likely start the tariffs on Aug. 1. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the president would send the letters, informing countries that \"'if you don't move things along, then, on Aug. 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level.'\" Bessent clarified that \"it's not a new deadline,\" but rather \"we are saying this is when it's happening.\"",
      "Hassett touted the trade strategy Sunday, saying \"people are responding to President Trump's potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the U.S., which is creating jobs.\"",
      "\"I think there's a race right now to get activity into the U.S., and in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump,\" Hassett added.",

      "\"This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left-wing thing,\" Burns said of cutting funds to PBS in an interview that aired Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in May instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. Then in June, the House approved a request from the White House to claw back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The package is expected to be taken up by the Senate in the coming weeks as the White House has targeted the public media entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "Burns, whose upcoming film \"The American Revolution\" is expected to air on PBS in November and has had more than 40 documentaries on the public broadcaster, told \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson that he's worried about PBS' future, noting that he's \"always been worried about it.\"",
      "The filmmaker recalled testifying before congressional committees in the 1990s about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He likened PBS to the \"Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world,\" saying it's \"bottom up.\"",
      "The funding cuts are \"shortsighted,\" Burns said, because \"it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only signal they get.\"",
      "Burns stressed that PBS has children's programming, continuing education, information on homeland security, crop reports and weather emergencies, saying, \"that, we're going to take away?\"",
      "\"I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bath water,\" Burns said.",

      "Of his work, Burns said many of the projects have \"taken time to incubate, and that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out, kind of like the National Parks or the Declaration of Independence applied to the landscape.\"",
      "\"These are really good American institutions that represent everybody from the bottom up, which is what it's always about,\" Burns said. \"That's the essence of what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.\"",

      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that the the U.S. is likely to start informing some countries on Friday what tariffs their exports will face. Earlier in the week, he said doesn't plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",

      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",

      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Countries that fail to come to terms with the Trump administration face potentially large tariff increases. For example, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit EU members with a 50% flat tariff.",
      "\"If this happens, the EU will likely feel compelled to respond in kind, potentially sparking a full trade war and market instability,\" analysts with investment adviser Gavekal said in a report.",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv, Israel\u00a0\u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump might look to take a victory lap Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran, hailed by both as an unmitigated success. But as they meet for the third time this year at the White House, the outwardly triumphant visit will be dogged by Israel's 21-month war against Hamas in Gaza and questions over how hard Mr. Trump will push for an end to the conflict.",
      "Mr. Trump has made it clear that following the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon, ideally with a ceasefire agreement reached \u00a0this week. The meeting between Mr. Trump and Netanyahu could give new urgency to a U.S. ceasefire proposal being discussed by Israel and Hamas, but whether it will lead to a deal that ends the war is unclear.",
      "\"The optics will be very positive,\" said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. \"But behind the victory lap are going to be some very serious questions.\"",
      "Before departing for Washington on Sunday, Netanyahu praised the cooperation with the U.S. for bringing a \"huge victory over our shared enemy.\" He struck a positive note on a ceasefire for Gaza, saying he was working \"to achieve the deal under discussion, on the terms we agreed to.\"",
      "\"I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Israel and Hamas appear to be inching toward a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom Netanyahu says are still alive.",
      "But a perennial sticking point is whether the ceasefire will end the war altogether. Hamas has said it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu has said the war will only end when Hamas is militarily defeated or surrenders, disarms and goes into exile \u2014 something the terrorist group's remaining leaders have refused to do.",
      "Trump's quest to be known as peacemaker",
      "Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to be known as a peacemaker. He's repeatedly touted recent peace deals that his administration helped to facilitate \u2014 between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and Israel and Iran \u2014 and for years he has made little secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "He has been pressuring Israel and Hamas to wrap up their own conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, ravaged Gaza, deepened Israel's international isolation and made any resolution to the broader conflict between Israel and the Palestinians more distant than ever.",
      "But the precise details of the proposed ceasefire deal, and whether it can lead to an end to the war, are still in flux. In the days before Netanyahu's visit, Mr. Trump seemed less certain of the chances of an imminent breakthrough.",
      "Asked on Friday how confident he was that a ceasefire deal would come together, he told reporters: \"I'm very optimistic \u2014 but you know, look, it changes from day to day.\"",
      "On Sunday evening, he seemed to narrow his expectations, telling reporters that he thought an agreement related to the remaining hostages would be reached in the coming week.",
      "Gaza peace hinged on Trump and Netanyahu's personal ties?",
      "After Mr. Trump's decision to get involved in Israel's war in Iran with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, he and Netanyahu have looked and sounded more in sync than ever. But that's not always been the case.",
      "As recently as Netanyahu's last visit to Washington in April, the tone was markedly different.",
      "Mr. Trump used the photo-op with Netanyahu to announce that the U.S. was entering into negotiations with Iran over its nuclear deal \u2014 appearing to catch the Israeli leader off guard and at the time, slamming the brakes on any Israeli military plan.",
      "He also praised Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a fierce critic of Israel's, in front of Netanyahu, and the two made no apparent progress on a trade deal at the height of Mr. Trump's tariff expansion.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose policies have largely aligned with Israel's own priorities, pledged last week to be \"very firm\" with Netanyahu on ending the war, without saying what that would entail. Pressure by Mr. Trump may have helped to convince Netanyahu in the past, with a previous ceasefire deal having been reached right as the president was taking office for his second term.",
      "Netanyahu has to balance the demands of his American ally with the far-right parties in his governing coalition who hold the key to his political survival and oppose ending the war.",
      "But given the strong U.S. support in Israel's war against Iran, highlighted by joint airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear sites, Netanyahu may have a tough time saying no.",
      "On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump said one of the matters he expected to discuss with Netanyahu \"is probably a permanent deal with Iran.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also may expect something in return for his recent calls for Netanyahu's corruption trial to be canceled \u2014 a significant interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state.",
      "\"Trump thinks that Netanyahu owes him,\" said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel affairs at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. \"And if Trump thinks that he needs to end the war In Gaza, then that is what he will need to do.\"",
      "Trump's vision for a remade Middle East hinged on Gaza",
      "But beyond Iran is Mr. Trump's grand vision for a new Middle East, where he hopes that additional countries will join the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel brokered during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Netanyahu and Mr. Trump are likely to discuss how to bring Syria into the fold. The country, a longtime enemy of Israel's, has new leadership after the fall of President Bashar Assad, and experts say conditions might be ripe for some kind of nonbelligerency agreement.",
      "Just last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order lifting a raft of U.S. sanctions against the Syrian government, paving the way for the nation's new leaders \u2014 former Islamist militants who publicly embraced secularism after toppling Assad \u2014 to further cement their governance and join the international community.",
      "But Mr. Trump's ultimate goal is to include regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia.",
      "The Saudis, whose clout could open the door for other Arab or Muslim countries to join, have expressed interest in normalizing ties with Israel but only if it is accompanied by serious steps toward resolving Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. For starters, that would seem to require action in Gaza.",

      "The Trump administration said it deported a group of eight men convicted of serious crimes in the United States to the conflict-ridden African country of South Sudan, following a legal saga that had kept the deportees stuck in a military base in Djibouti for weeks.",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight Eastern time on Friday. A photo provided by the department showed the deportees, with their hands and feet shackled, sitting inside an aircraft, guarded by U.S. service members.",
      "The deportations to South Sudan \u2014 a country plagued by armed conflict and political instability that the U.S. government warns Americans not to visit \u2014 mark an unprecedented new frontier in President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "None of the deportees is from South Sudan. They hail from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, and were ordered deported from the U.S. after being convicted of crimes, including murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "The high-profile legal battle over the fate of the men culminated when two federal judges on Friday denied a last-ditch attempt by immigration rights advocates to halt the deportations, saying their hands were tied by recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The deportations signify a major political victory for the Trump administration, which has sought to convince countries around the world \u2014 irrespective of their human rights record \u2014 to accept deportees who are not their citizens, including those convicted of serious crimes.",
      "\"A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman. \"This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "The deportations have also alarmed human rights advocates, who fear the men could face jail time, torture or other harms in South Sudan. They've argued the deportations to South Sudan are designed to punish the men for their crimes, even though they have already served criminal sentences in the U.S.",
      "\"The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process,\" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which tried to halt the deportations. \"Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how the deportees will be treated in South Sudan. A Justice Department attorney told a federal judge Friday that South Sudan informed the U.S. it would offer the men a temporary immigration status, but the lawyer could not confirm whether they would be detained. The Trump administration has said in court filings that South Sudanese officials have made assurances that the deportees will not face torture.",
      "The men's deportation was made possible by a Supreme Court order earlier this week. At the request of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Thursday clarified the scope of an earlier order it had issued to pause a lower court ruling barring deportations to third-party countries without a degree of due process and notice.",
      "That April lower court ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts had required the Trump administration to give detainees sufficient notice and a chance to be interviewed by a U.S. asylum officer before any deportation to a country where they did not hail from. That case thwarted several deportation efforts, including a plan to send detainees to Libya.",
      "When he learned of the administration's plan to deport the eight men to South Sudan in May, Murphy blocked that effort, mandating the U.S. to retain custody of the detainees and to offer them a chance to contest their deportation. The administration transferred the detainees to the Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti, where U.S. officials described dangerous conditions, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "But the Supreme Court last month suspended Murphy's ruling from April. And on Thursday, it said Murphy could no longer require the government to allow the detainees in Djibouti to contest their deportation, since the order underpinning that requirement had been paused.",
      "Hours later, immigrant rights advocates asked a different federal judge, Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., to halt the deportations to South Sudan. He did so on Friday, but only briefly before saying the request should be handled by Murphy.",
      "Moss expressed concern about risks to the men's \"physical safety\" and said the U.S. government should not be in the business of inflicting \"pain and suffering\" on people who have already served their sentence, even for a \"terrible crime.\" But he said his hands were tied, telling the advocates they needed to ask Murphy for any intervention.",
      "Later on Friday, Murphy denied the advocates' request, saying the Supreme Court orders were \"binding.\"",

    "summary": "Australian Erin Patterson was found guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 Australian Erin Patterson was found guilty Monday of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "The jury in the Supreme Court trial in Victoria state returned a verdict after six days of deliberations, following a nine-week trial that gripped Australia. Patterson faces life in prison and will be sentenced later, but a date for the hearing hasn't been scheduled.",
      "Patterson, who sat in the dock between two prison officers, showed no emotion but blinked rapidly as the verdicts were read.",
      "Three of Patterson's four lunch guests - her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson - died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband, who survived the meal.",
      "It wasn't disputed that Patterson served the mushrooms or that the pastries killed her guests. The jury was required to decide whether she knew the lunch contained death caps, and if she intended for them to die.",
      "The guilty verdicts, which were required to be unanimous, indicated that jurors rejected Patterson's defense that the presence of the poisonous fungi in the meal was a terrible accident, caused by the mistaken inclusion of foraged mushrooms that she didn't know were death caps. Prosecutors didn't offer a motive for the killings, but during the trial highlighted strained relations between Patterson and her estranged husband, and frustration that she had felt about his parents in the past.",
      "Victims' relatives asked for privacy in the wake of the jury's decision, police said, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The families \"have asked for privacy at this time,\" Victoria Police said in a statement. \"We will continue to support them in every way possible following this decision.\"",
      "Facts of case weren't disputed so Patterson's intentions were key",
      "The case turned on the question of whether Patterson meticulously planned a triple murder or accidentally killed three people she loved, including her children's only surviving grandparents. Her lawyers said she had no reason to - she had recently moved to a beautiful new home, was financially comfortable, had sole custody of her children and was due to begin studying for a degree in nursing and midwifery.",
      "But prosecutors suggested Patterson had two faces - the woman who publicly appeared to have a good relationship with her parents-in-law, while her private feelings about them were kept hidden. Her relationship with her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal lunch but didn't go, deteriorated in the year before the deaths, the prosecution said.",
      "The simplest facts of what happened that day and immediately afterward were hardly disputed. But Patterson's motivations for what she did and why were pored over in detail during the lengthy trial, at which more than 50 witnesses were called.",
      "The individual beef Wellington pastries Patterson served her guests was one point of friction, because the recipe she used contained directions for a single, family-sized portion. Prosecutors said that she reverted to individual servings so she could lace the other diners' portions, but not her own, with the fatal fungi - but Patterson said that she was unable to find the correct ingredients to make the recipe as directed.",
      "Nearly every other detail of the fateful day was scrutinized at length, including why Patterson sent her children out to a film before her guests arrived, why she added additional dried mushrooms to the recipe from her pantry, why she didn't become ill when the other diners did, and why she disposed of a food dehydrator after the deaths and told investigators she didn't own one.",
      "Patterson acknowledged some lies during her evidence - including that she'd never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator. But she said those claims were made in panic as she realized her meal had killed people.",
      "She said she didn't become as ill as the other diners since she vomited after the meal because of an eating disorder. She denied she told her guests she had cancer as a ruse to explain why she invited them to her home that day.",
      "The case gripped Australia",
      "The bizarre and tragic case has lingered in the minds of Australians and has provoked fervor among the public and media.",
      "During the trial, five separate podcasts analyzed each day of the proceedings and several news outlets ran live blogs giving moment-by-moment accounts of more than two months of evidence.",
      "At least one television drama and a documentary about the case are slated for production. Prominent Australian crime writers were seen in court throughout the trial.",
      "As it became clear half-an-hour before the verdict that court was reconvening, about 40 members of the public queued outside the courthouse in the rural town of Morwell in hope of watching the outcome in person. News outlets reported that no family members of victims were there.",
      "Before the verdict, newspapers published photos of black privacy screens erected at the entrance to Erin Patterson's home. Dozens of reporters from throughout Australia and from news outlets abroad crowded around friends of Patterson's as they left the courthouse Monday.",
      "\"I'm saddened, but it is what it is,\" said one friend, Ali Rose, who wore sunglasses and fought back tears. Asked what she thought Patterson felt as the verdicts were read, Rose said, \"I don't know.\"",
      "Details on the poisonous mushrooms that were served",
      "\"Death caps\" -- or amanita phalloides - are the deadliest mushrooms in the world, causing some 90 percent of fungus-related fatalities, according to AFP.",
      "It's easy to mistake the brown-and-white mushrooms for others, and they're said to have a\u00a0 pleasant taste when cooked.",
      "But toxicologist Dimitri Gerostamoulos testified that they're saturated with deadly chemicals known as amatoxins.",
      "\"They can lead to someone experiencing symptoms of diarrhoea, vomiting, feeling really unwell and they progressively get worse if the toxins are not removed,\" Gerostamoulos said."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 6, 2025.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: We turn now to Kevin Hassett. He is the director of the National Economic Council and one of President Trump's top advisors. He's also very popular on that driveway where I'm usually alongside about a dozen reporters. So, Kevin, thank you so much for your time this morning. I want to start with trade, because there's a big deadline coming up on Wednesday. As you know, that 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs that the President announced back in April is set to end. So far, the US has announced a few deals; the UK, Vietnam, and you're inching closer to a final agreement with China. Do you expect to get any more deals done with America's biggest trading partners by Wednesday?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yeah. First, I do have to take- take a pause and share your thoughts and prayers with the people of Texas. It's an incredible, heartbreaking story, and Kristi Noem and the President have instructed the federal government to throw everything they've got at helping the survivors and helping clean up that place. So, anyway, I'm really heartbroken today to see these stories, and I want you to know that in the White House, everybody is putting every effort they can into helping the people of Texas today. On trade, there's going to be quite a bit of news this week. And, I think, the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized. There are a whole number that Jameson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments, and then they're going to be letters that are sent to countries saying, here's how we think it ought to go, because the deals aren't advanced enough. And the headline is going to be that countries are agreeing around the world to open their markets up to our products, and to allow us to put some kind of tariff on their products when they come into the US. At exactly what the numbers will be, will be things that you'll find out in the news this week,.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin, you said there are going to be deals. For those really important trading partners, if there's not a deal by Wednesday, is the President going to extend this pause?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world. And there are deadlines, and there are things that are close, and so maybe things will push back the dead- past the deadline, or maybe they want- in the end, the President's going to make that judgment.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: And you also mentioned those letters that will start going out tomorrow, according to President Trump. He said about 10 to 12 countries will receive them. Do you- can you tell us who's going to get one and what they say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Because- because, again, the part of the letter that could be happening right is that we're close to a deal, we're not really satisfied with the progress that we're making at the deal, and so we're saying, okay, fine, we're going to send a letter, but maybe you get a deal at the last minute too. Until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Is it fair to say that those notices are going to go to our smaller trading partners, as you negotiate with our bigger ones?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think that it could be that it'll be both. But also, don't forget, that when we have great trade deals, our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners. And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I have to ask you about the deadlines, Kevin, to make these deals, because you just mentioned you're always open. The president said there's not really any flexibility left between now and Wednesday. Less than two weeks ago, the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that deals would be wrapped up by Labor Day. So, I wonder, you know, if- how can companies plan if the goal posts keep moving? How can countries negotiate if they don't even know how much time they have left?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, the rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear to everybody, because we have some deals like the UK, and the Vietnam deal that are starting to be, you know, I guess, guidelines for what might happen. But, one of the things that we're seeing that's really interesting to me, is that people are just on-shoring production of the US at a record rate. As we've had record job creation, record capital spending, and this is even ahead of the Big, Beautiful Bill. And so, I think what's happening is that people are responding to President Trump's, you know, potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the US, which is creating jobs, more than 2 million jobs, since he took office, and raising wages. You know, wage growth is heading up towards the really, really high pinnacles that we saw in 2017. And so, I think there's a race right now to get activity into the US. And, in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I remember after these reciprocal tariffs were announced, you told me that there were about 15 deals that countries were bringing to the President. How close, if you could give us any number at all, what number are we going to see this week?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yeah, you'll have- you'll have to get that from Jameson and the President. I think that, you know, we've seen lots of deals that have been finalized by our negotiators, and then the President finds things that could make them better. And so, it's- I'm not going to get ahead of the President on the number of deals.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Okay, thanks, Kevin. We'll look out for that. I want to move now to the One Big, Beautiful Bill that, of course, the President signed into law on Independence Day. You have it, and now you have to pay for it. And there's a consensus that this bill adds tremendously to the deficit. I know that you are so familiar with these numbers. The Yale Budget Lab estimates it will add $3 trillion to the debt. The Tax Foundation says this tax portion of the bill could also add $3 trillion to the deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which factors in interest on the debt, says it could add up to $5 trillion over the next decade. And on this very program, even Speaker Johnson answered in the affirmative when asked if this bill would add over $4 trillion to the deficit. I know that the administration says the bill will actually shrink the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Help me understand why there is such a drastic difference between your number and all those others.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well- well, first of all, let's remember that science is not democracy. Truth is not democracy. Our estimates are based on modeling that we used last time, when I was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to say what would happen if we had a bill, how much growth we would get. And we said, and we were criticized soundly, that we would get 3% growth. And we even had the really technical macroeconomic models that said that we would get 3% growth. We run the same models through this tax bill, it's even better. And what we're seeing is that if you get 3% growth again, then that's $4 trillion more in revenue than the CBO and these other bodies are giving us credit for. They have been wrong in the past, and they're being wrong again, in our belief. But, the thing that disappoints me is that if I put out a model and I say, hey, here's what's going to happen, we're going to get 3% growth. And then it turns out it's 1.5% growth, then, as an academic economist, as a scientist, then it's my duty to say, what did I get wrong? What did my model miss? These people aren't doing that. And that's the thing that I find disappointing, because we put peer-reviewed academic stuff on the table, said we're going to get that 3% growth, and then we got it right last time, and we believe we're going to get it right this time. But, if you think that 1.8% growth is what's going to happen over the next 10 years, then you should agree with the CBO number. But, there's another part of the CBO number that you need to worry about. And that is that if we don't pass the bill, that it's the biggest tax hike in history. And with that big tax hike, that of course, we would have a recession. The CEA says that we'd have about a 4% drop in GDP and lose 9 million jobs. If we had a 4% drop in GDP and we lost 9 million jobs, what would happen to the deficit? And so, I don't think that the CBO has a very strong record. I don't think these places have a very strong record. And what they need to do is get back to the basics of looking at macroeconomic models. There's a really famous macroeconomist at Harvard named Jim Stock. They should go back and read everything Jim Stock has written for the last 15 years, and fold those into their models, and then maybe we could talk.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I want to talk too, Kevin, about another number that I know you and the President disagree with, but that Democrats and many Republicans are worried about, and that's the CBO's projection that as many as 12 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage because of this law. What is the NEC's estimate for how many people could lose coverage?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well- well, yeah. Let's- let's unbundle that a little bit. Because, first, on the CBO coverage, so what are we doing? So, what we're doing is we're asking for a work requirement. But, the work requirement is that you need to be looking for work, or even doing volunteer work, and you don't need to do it until your kids are 14 or older. And so, the idea that that's going to cause a massive hemorrhaging in availability of insurance, doesn't make a lot of sense to us. And then, if you look at the CBO numbers, if you look at the big numbers, they say that people are going to lose insurance. About 5 million of those are people who have other insurance. They're people who have two types of insurance. And so, therefore, if they lose one, they're still insured. And so, the CBO numbers on that side don't make any sense to us at all. But, on the other side, go back to 2017 when we had work requirements for Obamacare, they said that we lose about 4 million insured between 2017 and 2019, and about double that over the next 10 years. And, in fact, the number of insured went up. It went up quite a bit, by more than 10 million over those two years, because the bottom line is, the best way to get insurance is to get a job. And we've got a Big, Beautiful Bill that's going to create a lot of job creation and a lot of insurance, and the CBO is just not accounting for that. And again, they need to go back and look at all the things that they got wrong. You realize that they're underestimating Medicaid spending by 20%. They should look back at all the things they got wrong, and explain what they're going to do to get it right in the future, and to do a better job. And if they do that, we'll take them more seriously. But right now, I don't think any serious thinker could take them seriously, because they've done so wrong, and wrong for so long. Even back- if you go back to when President Obama passed Obamacare, they got every single number there wrong about how many people would get private insurance and how few people would get Medicaid, and so on. And so, their record in this modeling space is about as bad as it's possible to be. In fact, you could, kind of, roll the roulette wheel and come up with a better set of numbers, better history, track record than CBO.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin, what about the enhanced subsidies? Is that number wrong too? That the ACA allows about $705 for people to help pay for their health insurance. That doesn't sound like the waste, fraud, and abuse that I know you and the President have talked about eliminating. That just sounds like people who cannot afford coverage, and now it's going to be even more so with the subsidies gone.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well- well, if you're- if you're looking at the- the change in the tax on the providers, which is something that has been a key talking point for the Democrats, they say that that's going to close down rural hospitals. What has happened is that, rather than let the states- the states have this game where they give a dollar to a hospital and then the federal government matches the dollar, and then the state taxes some of the dollar away. In other words, that we have an agreement with the states that they're going to match, but then they have this they have this trick where they tax the hospitals after they give them the money, so really, it's the federal government giving them the money. And that's why we've been overspending Medicaid by 20% since this trick started happening. And so, what we've done is that we've put a haircut on that. But, we've also put $50 billion into a trust fund to make sure that the rural hospitals are there to treat the sick. So, I think this is a prudent form. It's sound budgetary politics. And I think that nobody's going to lose their insurance.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin Hassett, we will watch for how that ages. Thank you very much. Really appreciate --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: - And if I get it wrong, we'll check, and we'll talk about why I got it wrong. I promise.",

      "REP. TOM SUOZZI: Yeah, thanks so much for having me.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, you just heard from Kevin Hassett- you know, like President Trump, he said, without this bill, it would be one of the greatest tax hikes for the American public. They say it is the greatest tax cut in American history. You sit on the Ways and Means Committee, so I have to wonder how you describe it.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I describe it as the big, ugly bill, not the 'big, beautiful bill.' It's going to do a lot of things that are going to hurt a lot of people in our country. The biggest one, which you talked about with Mr. Hassett, is increase the deficit enormously in the country. And what that does, is that creates inflation, that keeps interest rates high, that makes it hard for people to buy homes, makes it hard for them to borrow money, to do the things that they want to do. In addition, it's going to knock a bunch of people off of health care. We know the Republicans have tried for a decade to undo the Affordable Care Act- Obamacare, and this is kind of a backdoor way to take health insurance away from people that really need it the most here in our nation. And it's going to cause health insurance costs to go up for a lot of people. One of the President's biggest issues he campaigned on was reducing prices rapidly on day one, we're going to cut the costs. Well, costs are not going down, inflation- inflation is going to be affected by this deficit. Interest rates are going to stay high, and this is going to have a negative impact on health insurance costs for many people in our country.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I know that you just brought up Medicaid and potential loss of coverage. What do you say to some Americans who might wonder, well, why should the able bodied not have to work in order to access Medicaid?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, you have to understand that 92% of the people that are able to work are currently working, and the 8% that are not are often people that are taking care of disabled children. Remember that two thirds of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. One-tenth of all the veterans in the United States of America are on Medicaid. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many people that are facing such difficult circumstances that we can't even possibly imagine. And why would we be taking health insurance and food benefits away from some of the most needy Americans while we're providing what I believe is an unnecessary tax break for some of the wealthiest Americans. It just doesn't make sense that you're reducing taxes for some of the wealthiest people, hurting some of the lowest income people, while blowing the biggest deficit in the budget that we've had in the history of the country. Those things just don't add up.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, just last week, you said you agree with 75% of what's in this package, that's a pretty significant number. So why isn't it worth the 25% that you don't like?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Because those things that I just mentioned are so devastating. I like the idea that we're investing more money to secure the border. I like the idea that we are providing tax breaks to lower income folks and hard working middle class folks and people aspiring to the middle class. I like the idea of providing tax breaks for those folks. But why are we providing- and when the economy is doing as well as it has been over the past several years, why would we be providing a tax decrease- tax breaks for some of the wealthiest Americans in our country, while blowing a massive hole in the deficit?",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Congressman, I want to turn to an op-ed that you wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week saying, Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City's Democratic mayoral primary should be a quote, 'loud wake up call for Democrats.' What lessons do you think your party can learn from- from his campaign?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, you know, I disagree with Mr. Mamdani. I have to make that very clear that, you know, I'm a Democratic capitalist. I'm not a Democratic socialist. And- but you have to recognize that he tapped into something. He tapped into the same thing that Donald Trump tapped into, which is that people are concerned that the economy is not working for them. Affordability and the economy is the number one issue in the country. And too often, Democrats are not perceived as being focused on affordability and the economy and the middle class, and people aspiring to the middle class and their economic concerns. They see Democrats as being primarily focused on reproductive rights and on LGBT protections, which are important issues, but they're not the issues that people think about every night when they're lying in bed thinking about paying their bills or when they're talking about how they're going to send their kids to school. So Democrats have got to do a better job learning from both Trump and Mamdani not with their solutions, which I think are wrong, but with the diagnosis of the problem that we're frustrated, we're concerned. Everybody in America, whether you're a right wing conservative or a left wing progressive, should believe that in return for working hard, you make enough money so you can live a good life. You can buy a home, you can educate your children, you can pay for your health insurance, you can retire one day without being scared. People don't feel that currently, and we have to do a better job of communicating that.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, I'm glad you brought up the perception, because you also wrote that 'Democrats must recognize the future starts with a message of economic security for American families.' I covered the Biden campaign. I covered the Harris campaign. That was the center of their messages. So what's the problem here? Is it the messenger? Is it the messaging? Because they have that message already.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: It's a combination. Number- the Democratic Party as a whole has to have this platform that focuses on what the people care about. They care about the economy, they care about immigration, they care about taxes, they care about crime, they care about health care. But then we have to recognize that the media infrastructure is fractured, and Trump figured it out before the Democrats have, which is that it's not just traditional media like your shows and newspapers, but it's social media. It's podcasts. Podcasts, the top 500 podcasts in America, 400 of the top 500 are right leaning. 100 are left leaning. And of the 100 left leaning ones, half of them beat the, you know what, out of the Democrats. Then you have other national media, and then you have some of this ethnic and underground media related to WeChat and WhatsApp and different types of apps that people use. So we have to communicate across all those platforms, because people are getting their messages in these fractured environments and living in these echo chambers, and we have to do a better job communicating across all these platforms and getting Democrats as a whole to focus on the economy, immigration, et cetera.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Alright, Congressman, we are all trying to learn all those new languages. Thank you so much for your time this morning. And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "summary": "The Dalai Lama says he'll have a successor, after all, ending years of speculation that he might be the last person to hold the role and meaning he'd be reincarnated.",
    "story": [
      "Dharamshala, India \u2014 The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that started when he indicated he might be the last person to hold the role. His having a successor would mean he would be reincarnated.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said at prayer celebrations ahead of his upcoming 90th birthday that the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized as per past Buddhist traditions, while signaling that China should stay away from the process of identifying his successor.",
      "The Dalai Lama's succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China's tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",
      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China's Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas \u2014 one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a daily news briefing Wednesday said \"the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\" and \"approval by the central government.\"",
      "Mao said the process must \"follow religious rituals and historical settings, and be handled in accordance with national laws and regulations.\"",
      "Tenzin Gyatso became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in the town of Dharamshala in India since then, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust \u2014 a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\"No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\" he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \"accordance with past tradition.\"",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \"an earnest request with single-minded devotion\" that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \"for the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",
      "\"In response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama's succession, saying it is a \"unique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\"",
      "\"We not only strongly condemn the People's Republic of China's usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain, and will never accept it,\" he said.",
      "The search for a Dalai Lama's reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent's death.",
      "In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby and groomed to take the reins.",

      "\"Generally speaking, most people want to look like a better version of themselves,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Certainly, there are some people who do want to look like a certain celebrity or an influencer they have seen on social media, so we may see a temporary uptick in requests for a breast augmentation to look like a certain celebrity who has admitted to having theirs done.\"",
      "\"However, it is not very realistic to look like someone else,\" Hadeed added. \"Every woman starts off with a different breast size, volume, shape and anatomy.\u00a0A good breast augmentation should result in a natural look that compliments the chest and body, and since there are so many options for breast implants, it is important to find the right implant for each patient depending on what her aesthetic goals are.\"",

      "\"Confession can be a PR triumph or a social media bloodbath \u2013 there\u2019s no middle ground,\" Schiffer said. \"Some fans applaud the honesty, others see it as normalizing vanity. For each fan who praises transparency, there\u2019s one who calls it a desperate plea for attention.\"",
      "He continued, \"Owning up to surgery humanizes a celebrity \u2013 or expose them as just another insecure narcissist. It\u2019s negative if the work looks botched \u2013 transparency can\u2019t rescue bad art direction on your epidermis.\"",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"You can also think of it as pre-emptive crisis insurance: disclose the nip-tuck details before TMZ finds the OR log, and the headline reads \u2018empowered,\u2019 not \u2018exposed,'\" Schiffer added. \"In the TikTok courtroom, hiding a facelift is securities fraud against your own face.\"",

      "\"Getting \u2018work done\u2019 is inevitable in Hollywood; until recently, \u2018giving credit\u2019 was not,\" he said. \"As social media continues to be a tool to close the gap between celebrities and their fans \u2013 by providing the illusion of proximity, authenticity and relatability \u2013 then this is the logical \u2018update\u2019 for those apps: candor.\"",

      "\"Expect even more grotesque detail and surgical oversharing,\" he said. \"Confession is contagious; each celebrity who comes clean drags a dozen more into the lights.\"",
      "Schiffer continued, \"Transparency is now a competitive sport \u2013 who can be more brutally honest, more raw? This isn\u2019t a trend \u2013 it\u2019s a permanent mutation in celebrity culture. The next frontier is not just admitting surgery, but live-streaming it.\"",

      "WHAT YOUR BLOOD QUIETLY REVEALS ABOUT YOUR EATING HABITS",
      "\"Our analysis showed that the strongest association is observed at lower exposure levels equivalent to a serving or less, which implies that consuming these food items on a regular basis at any amount increases the risk of adverse health outcomes.\"",

      "Potential limitations",
      "The major limitations of this study are associated with dietary intake assessment, Haile acknowledged.",
      "\"Almost all of the included studies used food frequency questionnaires to assess intake, which can introduce measurement errors, primarily due to difficulties experienced by respondents in recalling long-term intake,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Several studies included in the analysis only looked at consumption at the start of the study, Haile noted \u2014 \"which might not accurately reflect the future dietary habits of the study participants.\"",

      "\"At the end of the day, the office donut or bottle of soda is almost certainly doing more metabolic damage than a slice of deli turkey.\"",
      "\"While these large studies have certain strengths, one key weakness is that they lump together many different foods within a single category,\" the researcher went on. \"There are various ways to process meats, and not all will have the same biological consequences.\"",

To me, it\u2019s extremely significant that Xi Jinping is not going. It suggests turbulence at home \u2014 there are signs he\u2019s lost control of the military and that civilian rivals are reasserting power. This is a symptom of that.\"",

      "\"China is actively harming all those countries for the most part, maybe with some exceptions, through its malign trade policies and dumping and overcapacity.\"",
      "Some analysts point to rising China-India friction as a contributing factor in Xi\u2019s decision to skip the summit.",
      "\"China has been at war with India for decades, essentially,\" Burack said. \"These are fundamentally opposing interests. It\u2019s difficult to see China changing its behavior in the near term, and that will keep tensions high.\"",

      "Economist Christian Briggs highlighted BRICS\u2019s massive scale: \"BRICS now comprises 12 full members and up to 23 when counting partners. Collectively, they account for over 60% of the world\u2019s GDP and around 75% of the global population. They control vast natural resources and a growing share of global trade flows.\"",

      "The alliance\u2019s aspirations to challenge the U.S. dollar through alternative payment systems and a potential BRICS currency have gained media traction \u2014 but experts caution against overestimating this threat.",

      "Chang echoed this skepticism: \"The only country that can challenge the dollar is the United States. Weakness in the dollar is due to what we are doing domestically, not what the BRICS are doing.\"",

      "Yet Chang sees India as a brake on any aggressive anti-Western tilt. \"BRICS has an \u2018I\u2019 in it\u2014and that\u2019s India. Modi doesn\u2019t want to be part of an anti-Western bloc. As long as India\u2019s in BRICS, the rest of the world is safe.\"",

      "The White House statement comes on the heels of several striking examples from the exhibit.",
      "One placard, featured alongside a 1923 circus poster, reads: \"Under the big top, circuses expressed the colonial impulse to claim dominion over the world.\" Another, describing early American entertainment, declares: \"One of the earliest defining traits of entertainment in the United States was extraordinary violence.\"",
      "The exhibit reframes iconic American characters through a critical, politically-charged lens. On The Lone Ranger, the display states: \"The White title character\u2019s relationship with Tonto resembled how the U.S. government imagined itself the world\u2019s Lone Ranger.\"",
      "Mickey Mouse, a beloved American cultural icon, is not spared either. A display for the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie states, \"Mickey challenged authority, but not everyone was in on the joke.\"",
      "It continues: \"Mickey Mouse debuted as the deckhand \u2018Steamboat Willie\u2019 in 1928, amidst a rising anxiety felt by many that modern living and city life were eroding family and community ties and loosening moral codes\u2026 But the new character\u2019s outsized facial features, white gloves, and trickster temperament were vestiges of longstanding traditions of blackface minstrelsy.\"",
      "In reference to the Indiana Jones film series, another panel reads: \"His character embodied a confident righteousness that, in many ways, captured the essence of the 1980s\" above another subhead referencing President Ronald Reagan's famous speech, asking, \"Are you better off?\"KENT STATE STUDENT'S VIOLENT ANTI-TRUMP ART DISPLAY SPURS OUTRAGE",

      "One panel calls Magnum, P.I. a challenge to the \"popular perceptions of Vietnam veterans as damaged misfits.\" A section on Jon Stewart\u2019s Daily Show refers to it as \"the go-to for viewers who mistrusted politicians and the reporting process.\"",
      "Another panel highlights the late pop star Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez and frames her cultural impact through identity politics.",
      "\"Selena got us talking about identity,\" with a quote from the late singer reading, \"I feel very proud to be Mexican.\"",
      "The text goes on to say her work \"cast a light on the longstanding cultural and growing political influence of Mexican American and Latinx communities within the United States.\"",
      "\"The examples [Fox News Digital] highlighted from the National Museum of American History are part of the problem the Trump Administration aims to fix,\" Halligan said. \"Framing American culture as inherently violent, imperialist, or racist does not reflect the greatness of our nation or the millions of Americans who have contributed to its progress.\"",
      "A display at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History explores changing gender norms, featuring Mae West, Judy Garland, and Olympic swimmer Gertrude Ederle. The backdrop includes a quote in English and Spanish: \"When I\u2019m bad, I\u2019m better.\" (Fox News Digital)",
      "Halligan confirmed that a top-to-bottom content review is already underway, with input from senior Smithsonian leaders and the Board of Regents. \"We are working with leadership at the Smithsonian to audit and review all content at the museums,\" she said, \"and we are committed to ensuring that such content honors our country\u2019s founding principles, tells the stories of American heroes, and does not promote fringe or activist ideologies masquerading as history.\"",
      "She added, \"We will provide updates on this audit as our progress unfolds.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution responded to Fox News Digital with the following brief written statement: \"The museum is committed to continuous and rigorous scholarship and research and unbiased presentation of facts and history. As such, and as previously announced, we are assessing content in Smithsonian museums and will make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards.\"",
      "The Institution did not answer specific questions regarding who authored the Entertainment Nation exhibit, whether outside academic consultants or activist organizations were involved, or who made the decision to present all exhibit text bilingually in English and Spanish.",
      "The controversy comes amid a broader push by President Donald Trump to reshape cultural institutions he says have veered too far left.",
      "The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History is seen from the Washington Monument on June 3, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Kevin Carter/Getty Images)",
      "In March, Trump issued an executive order directing the Board of Regents to eliminate \"improper, divisive or anti-American ideology\" from Smithsonian museums. He accused the institution of embracing what he called \"a revisionist movement\" aimed at \"undermining the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.\"",
      "The Board of Regents includes the vice president, the chief justice of the United States, six members of Congress, and nine citizen regents.",
      "Vice President J.D. Vance and Congressman Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, both recent appointees, have advocated for an expedited review of Smithsonian content. Gim\u00e9nez, in a prior interview with The Wall Street Journal, confirmed tensions at the board\u2019s June meeting over how quickly to proceed, though ultimately a compromise was reached.",

      "While the museum\u2019s stated goal is to explore how entertainment intersects with American identity, the Trump administration argues that it instead uses culture to smuggle in ideology often at odds with the values most Americans hold.",

A series of international wire transfers to accounts on the Federal Trade Commission's restricted list has been flagged. There have been reports of suspicious activities associated with your Social Security Number in Texas and New Mexico. We would like to inform you that this document contains sensitive information and should be managed carefully. The document presented here is an official communication from the Social Security Administration, authorized by the Texas Attorney General. The Texas Court has directed the suspension of your Social Security Number due to its association with money laundering activities involving your bank accounts.\"",
      "At first glance, the email looks official enough to cause real panic. It name-drops major authorities like the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Texas Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to make the threat sound credible. By tying your SSN to federal crimes, the scammers are not just suggesting you might be in trouble. They imply serious legal consequences, even the possibility of arrest.",

      "Another psychological trick the scammers use is overwhelming the reader with details. They mention multiple states such as Texas and New Mexico, wire transfers and restricted lists, all to create the impression that the situation is deeply serious and far beyond an individual's control.

It's all about creating panic so you'll act before you think. Remember, real government agencies don't send scary emails demanding immediate action, threaten you with arrest or ask for payment in gift cards or wire transfers.

He also reflected on the challenges. According to Goldman, hardware startups require significant time and money to succeed. He found that the robotics ecosystem in France was not mature enough to support such a venture. He also realized that running a tech company and a restaurant simultaneously posed unique challenges. The two industries have different cultures, customer expectations and business models.",

Instead of reflexively reaching for your phone, try doing nothing or something analog. Read a book, breathe deeply or just let your mind wander. These \"in-between\" moments are where clarity often happens.",

      "Replace doom-scrolling with quick wins:\u00a0Build a list of low-effort, high-reward alternatives to scrolling. Think: a five-minute stretch, stepping outside, organizing a drawer or sending a voice message to a friend. The key is having options ready when the urge to scroll hits.",
      "Involve someone else:\u00a0Accountability works. Whether it's a friend, partner or roommate, ask someone to check in with you, or even hold the screen time passcode. Just knowing someone else is watching can make mindless scrolling less appealing.",

Scammers often use lookalike pages to steal your information.

    "story": [
      "A growing number of fire departments across the country are turning to artificial intelligence to help detect and respond to wildfires more quickly.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence in education is forcing schools and universities to rethink everything from homework policies to how final exams are administered. With tools like ChatGPT now widespread, students can generate essays, solve complex math problems or draft lab reports in seconds, raising urgent questions about what authentic learning looks like in 2025.",
      "To fight back, some schools are turning to an unlikely solution: pen and paper. The old-school \"blue book,\" a lined booklet used for handwritten test answers, is staging a comeback, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. And while it might seem like a relic of a pre-digital era, educators say it's one of the most effective tools they have to ensure students are actually doing their own work.",

      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: CHATGPT REWIRING YOUR BRAIN",
      "Exam blue book\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How common is AI cheating in schools today?",
      "While it's difficult to measure precisely, recent surveys suggest up to 89% of students have used AI tools like ChatGPT to help with coursework. Some admit to using it only for brainstorming or grammar fixes, but others rely on it to write entire papers or take-home tests. As reported, the spike in academic dishonesty has left faculty scrambling to preserve academic standards.",
      "Universities have reported a sharp rise in disciplinary cases tied to AI, but many incidents likely go undetected. Detection software like Turnitin's AI writing checker is being used more widely, but even those tools admit their systems aren't foolproof.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why AI cheating in schools is so hard to detect",
      "One reason this trend is so hard to police is that generative AI has become surprisingly good at mimicking human writing. Tools can tailor tone and style and even match a student's previous work, making plagiarism nearly impossible to identify without sophisticated forensics or human intuition.",
      "In blind tests, teachers have often been unable to distinguish between human and AI-written responses. Making matters worse, some schools that initially tried detection software have started abandoning it due to accuracy concerns and privacy issues.",
      "A student using ChatGPT on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why schools are bringing back blue books to stop AI cheating",
      "In response, a growing number of professors are bringing exams back into the classroom, with pen and paper. Schools like Texas A&M, University of Florida and UC Berkeley have all reported surging demand for blue books over the last two years. The logic is simple: If students have to write their essays by hand during class time, there's no opportunity to copy from ChatGPT or another AI assistant. It's not just nostalgia; it's a strategic shift. In-person, handwritten exams are harder to game, and some instructors say the quality of student thinking actually improves without digital shortcuts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Are handwritten exams enough to stop AI cheating in schools?",
      "Still, not everyone is convinced this is the answer. Critics argue that relying on in-class, timed writing may shortchange students on deeper research skills and analytical thinking, especially for complex topics that benefit from time, revision and outside sources. Plus, blue books do little to prevent AI misuse on homework, group projects or take-home essays.",
      "Should schools ban AI tools or teach responsible use?",
      "Some educators are pushing for a more balanced response: Instead of banning AI tools, teach students how to use them responsibly. That means integrating AI literacy into the curriculum, so students learn where the line is between inspiration and plagiarism and understand when it's appropriate to use tools like ChatGPT or Grammarly.",
      "\"AI is part of the professional world students will enter,\" said one university dean quoted in The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\"Our job is to teach them how to think critically, even with new tools in hand.\"",
      "A teacher teaching a lesson and a student using her smartphone\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s next in the fight against AI cheating in schools?",
      "As AI tools evolve, so will the strategies schools use to ensure honest learning. Some are shifting toward oral exams, where students must explain their reasoning out loud. Others are assigning more process-based work, such as annotated drafts, recorded brainstorming sessions or group projects that make cheating harder. There's no silver bullet, but one thing is clear: the AI genie isn't going back in the bottle, and the education system must adapt quickly or risk losing credibility.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI cheating in education has forced schools to take a hard look at how they assess student learning. The return of the blue book is a sign of just how serious the problem has become and how far educators are willing to go to protect academic integrity. But the real solution will probably involve a mix of old and new, using analog tools like blue books, embracing digital detection methods and teaching students why honest work matters. As AI continues to evolve, education will have to evolve with it. The goal isn't just to stop cheating, it's to make sure students leave school with the skills, knowledge and values they need to succeed in the real world.",

      "You don't need spy-grade tech to hack a phone. The truth is, most phones get compromised not by brute force, but by everyday tricks that prey on users' habits and software gaps.",
      "Phishing is one of the most common methods. This usually involves receiving a fake text, email or even a phone call designed to trick you into clicking a malicious link or sharing sensitive information. It could look like a message from your bank, a delivery service or even a friend.",
      "SIM-swapping is another major threat. In this scam, someone convinces your phone provider to move your number to a SIM card. Once they gain control, they can read your texts, take calls and access accounts that rely on your number.",
      "Malicious apps are also a big risk, especially on devices where users sideload apps or install them from unofficial sources. Some apps appear harmless but are designed to spy on your activity, steal data or give remote access to an attacker.",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks can be another weak spot.\u00a0On an unsecured network, hackers can intercept your data or inject malware into websites. Even Bluetooth can be a vulnerability if it's left on in public. In rare cases, tools exist that allow hackers to connect to your phone without your knowledge, especially if your software isn't up to date.",

      "If your phone is suddenly acting strange, like sending texts you didn\u2019t write, installing apps you don\u2019t recognize or draining your battery much faster than usual, it could be a sign that something is wrong. Unexpected pop-ups, background noise during calls or your phone heating up even when idle can also be red flags.",
      "Another clue is if your contacts start getting messages or calls from you that you didn\u2019t send. This might mean someone has access to your messaging apps or social media accounts. If you\u2019re locked out of accounts linked to your phone number, or if your mobile service suddenly stops working, it could point to SIM swapping.",

Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address or phone number before clicking links or downloading attachments. Even though smartphones have built-in security, installing a trusted antivirus app adds an important extra layer of protection. Strong antivirus software can scan your device for malware, spyware and other malicious programs that might be lurking unnoticed.

Developers release updates not only to add new features but also to patch security flaws that hackers can exploit. Ignoring updates leaves your device vulnerable to attacks, so make it a habit to install them as soon as they become available.",
      "Two-factor authentication is one of the simplest and most effective ways to protect your accounts.

Hackers often hide malware inside seemingly harmless apps or files, so clearing these out can stop threats before they escalate. It's a simple but powerful step to help secure your device.",
      "If your phone has been compromised, it's possible that your personal information, like your name, address, phone number or email is already being shared or sold online. Hackers often collect this data to commit identity theft or launch targeted phishing attacks. A personal data removal service can scan data broker sites and request your information be deleted, reducing your risk of further exposure. These services offer ongoing monitoring to help you stay protected even after a hack.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If your phone continues to act strangely after you\u2019ve tried other fixes, a factory reset on your iPhone or Android might be necessary. This process erases all data and settings, essentially giving you a fresh start. Before doing this, back up your important files, photos and contacts because a factory reset will delete everything on your device. Once reset, reinstall only trusted apps to reduce the risk of reinfection.",
      "Note: While a factory reset removes most malware, extremely advanced spyware may persist. If you suspect this level of compromise, consult a cybersecurity expert or consider replacing the device.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Phone hacking may seem like something that only happens in movies or to high-profile individuals, but the truth is anyone can be a target. Most attacks rely on simple tricks and human error, not advanced hacking skills.

There's no need for bulky wearables or complicated training. Instead, you simply move your limbs, and the system instantly records and communicates those movements and the associated muscle activity. Equipped with a display and speakers, the interface also provides real-time audiovisual feedback, creating a two-way connection that feels intuitive and engaging.",

The Capsule Interface also has significant potential for disaster response, enabling operators to control robots in hazardous environments without risk to human life. In everyday life, it can assist with household chores, support elderly family members and help farmers manage agricultural robots remotely.",

In simple terms, this means the device would not only let you control a robot, but also allow you to feel what the robot is doing, like sensing resistance when lifting something heavy or feeling the texture of an object through the robot.",
      "By giving you this kind of physical sensation, the experience becomes much more lifelike, making remote collaboration and communication feel even more natural and engaging.

      "There has been little change in U.S. energy consumption over the past decade. Increased efforts to make energy use more efficient have kept levels low. But over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. Some estimates show the facilities are expected to require as much energy in 2030 as the entire country of Japan does today.",
      "\"Every investor is lining up to invest in the next AI breakthrough. But when it comes to energy, there is a challenge in terms of permitting, the reality of construction timelines for new power plants and new grid capabilities,\" said senior advisor with the Wadhwani A.I. center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"All of this could slow down A.I. just as the research and development is preparing for takeoff.\"",
      "The demand from tech firms comes amid skepticism from consumers. According to a Fox News Poll on how voters felt about A.I. in society, 43% saw it as a good thing, while 47% thought it was a bad thing.",
      "\"I think it's natural that people will always have, call it a mixture of hopes and anxieties about what a new technology, including any new technology and especially AI may bring,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said. \"The truth is we all rely on AI already, even if we don't think about it.\"",

      "Over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "While positive views have increased faster than negative views, according to polling from 2023, subgroups surveyed expressed opinions all over the board. Most rural voters, White voters, women and those over the age of 45 viewed A.I. as a bad thing. Urban voters, non-White voters, men and those younger than 45 viewed the technology as good. Among major political parties, registered Republicans were most optimistic about A.I. but no party\u2019s approval was above 50%.",
      "Despite the somewhat negative sentiment of most voters, tech companies are powering on.",
      "\"A.I. relies on a lot of what we call compute. A lot of chips that do a lot of calculations and a lot of data that is accessed and is stored. So all of that requires more electricity. And it's why we have to pursue new partnerships as we are with the kinds of companies that generate electricity,\" Smith said.",
      "At least two nuclear plants are scheduled to restart thanks to big tech partnerships.",
      "\"I think this will all become an increasing part of the nation's electricity future,\" Smith said. \"It only makes sense for a power company to invest, to bring something like Three Mile Island back online if it has a guarantee that somebody's gonna purchase it.

      "\"Very small traces of radioactivity have been released from the plant,\" said Metropolitan Edison Vice President John \"Jack\" Herbein at the time.",
      "While there were no detectable health effects, the incident changed how nuclear plants operate. Three Mile Island Unite 1 closed in 2019 for economic reasons. Constellation and Microsoft plan to restart the reactor as early as 2027 at what is now called Crane Energy Center. It will add more than 800 megawatts of energy. That\u2019s enough to power more than 800,000 homes. Nuclear power has the highest energy efficiency rate, yet energy producers say the U.S. should remain diversified.",

      "Microsoft is working to add the amount of power back to the grid that the company\u2019s data centers will use from the regional transmission system.",
      "\"Our philosophy as a company is that we will invest to bring onto the electric grid as much or more power than we will consume,\" Smith said. \"We will do that in a way that ensures that none of the neighbors are going to see rise in their electricity rates.\"",
      "Constellation is also partnering with Meta to relicense its Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois for another 20 years.",

Amazon will build two data center complexes in Pennsylvania and use nearly two gigawatts of electricity from Talen Energy\u2019s nuclear plant. Google is partnering with Elementl Power on three nuclear projects, each expected to produce 600 megawatts.",
      "\"This is all nuclear. It's a hot industry. It's a brilliant industry,\" President Donald Trump said as he signed several executive orders in May. Those are intended to quadruple domestic nuclear power production within the next 25 years.",
      "\"To win the AI race, we're going to need a lot of energy,\" White House A.I. and Crypto Czar David Sacks said. \"The new AI data centers are very power hungry. They consume a lot of electricity. And the U.S. electric grid really hasn't grown very much over the past decade.\"",

      "At the center of the controversy is the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), a company jointly owned by several of the largest U.S. airlines, including Delta, American Airlines and United. ARC\u2019s core business includes managing ticket settlements between airlines and travel agencies. However, under a lesser-known initiative called the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP), ARC collects and monetizes vast amounts of data from domestic flight bookings. This includes names, complete itineraries and payment details.",
      "Internal government records and procurement documents reveal that Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the Department of Homeland Security, has purchased access to ARC's TIP data to track individuals of interest across the U.S. While CBP maintains that this data supports criminal and administrative investigations, critics argue that the arrangement raises major privacy concerns.",
      "The data is shared without travelers' knowledge or consent, and ARC reportedly requested that the agency keep its identity confidential unless legally required to disclose it.",
      "The documents confirm that CBP\u2019s initial contract with ARC began in June 2024. It has already been extended and may continue through 2029. Although the initial amounts seem modest, around $11,000 with a recent $6,800 update, the implications are far-reaching.",

The system can be queried by name, credit card or even travel agency. Importantly, it does not include data from tickets purchased directly through airline websites, focusing instead on bookings made via travel agencies, such as Expedia.",

      "The DHS has justified its use of TIP data in a public Privacy Impact Assessment, noting the program helps in active investigations.

      "6 ways you can protect your privacy from data brokers",
      "If you want to take back control of your personal information, here are six smart steps you can take right now to reduce your exposure to data brokers.",
      "1. Book flights directly on airline websites:\u00a0Whenever you can, avoid using third-party travel sites like Expedia, Orbitz or travel agencies. These platforms are the main sources of the data collected by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) through its Travel Intelligence Program. When you book directly on an airline\u2019s official website or mobile app, your data is far less likely to be shared with ARC or sold to government agencies. While it might be tempting to look for deals on aggregator sites, once you find a fare you like, try to book it directly through the airline.",
      "2. Use virtual or disposable credit cards:\u00a0The ARC system allows queries by credit card number, which means your travel activity can be tracked even if your name is not directly searched. To protect yourself, consider using a virtual credit card or a disposable card number for flight bookings. These are often available through banking apps or fintech services like Revolut, Privacy.com or certain American Express accounts. Virtual cards are tied to your main account but generate a temporary number that can only be used once or at a specific merchant. This makes it much harder for brokers to link future bookings to you.",
      "3. Share the bare minimum when booking:\u00a0Be cautious about the personal information you enter during the booking process. Unless it is legally required, avoid adding unnecessary details like your frequent flyer number, passport data for domestic flights or secondary phone numbers. You can also create a separate email address specifically for travel bookings to reduce the risk of cross-linking data with your other online accounts. When it comes to loyalty programs, consider opting out or using a separate identity if you are concerned about data being shared across companies.",
      "4. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete",
      "5. Use a privacy-focused browser and email service: Prevent tracking at the source by using privacy-first tools. Switch to browsers like Brave, Firefox or DuckDuckGo, which block ads and data collectors by default. Set up a separate, secure alias email address for booking travel using services.

Identity theft companies can assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. They can also monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.",

      "The ARC incident is yet another example of federal agencies bypassing traditional legal channels by buying sensitive data from private firms. Travelers are not just passengers, they are data points in a growing ecosystem where information is currency. The fact that this trade happened without informed consent and behind legal smokescreens should worry anyone who values privacy.",

      "Google DeepMind has introduced a powerful on-device version of its Gemini Robotics AI.",
      "This new system allows robots to complete complex tasks without relying on a cloud connection. Known as Gemini Robotics On-Device, the model brings Gemini's advanced reasoning and control capabilities directly into physical robots. It is designed for fast, reliable performance in places with poor or no internet connectivity, making it ideal for real-world, latency-sensitive environments.",

It can understand natural language, perform fine motor tasks and generalize from very little data, all without requiring an internet connection. According to Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind, the system is \"small and efficient enough\" to operate directly onboard. Developers can use the model in situations where connectivity is limited, without sacrificing intelligence or flexibility.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

The system delivers faster response times and fewer points of failure, opening up new possibilities for robot deployment in real-world settings.",
      "Safety requires developer input",
      "The on-device model does not include built-in semantic safety features. Google recommends that developers build safety systems into their robots using tools like the Gemini Live API and trusted low-level controllers. The company is limiting access to select developers to better study safety risks and real-world applications. While the hybrid model still offers more overall power, this version holds its own for most common use cases and helps push robotics closer to everyday deployment.",

If the email doesn\u2019t appear in your Amazon Message Center, it\u2019s not real. Also hover over the sender\u2019s name to see the full email address. Genuine messages come from @amazon.com and may show the Amazon smile logo if your inbox supports it.",
      "Genuine email sent from @amazon.com\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. Avoid clicking on unknown links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing emails often contain links that appear to lead to Amazon but actually take you to fake websites designed to steal your information. Instead of clicking, it\u2019s safer to type amazon.com directly into your browser to verify any claims. For added protection, consider using antivirus software that can detect scam links, block dangerous sites, and alert you to phishing emails or ransomware threats. This extra layer of security helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "4. Reduce your exposure to scammers:\u00a0Phishing emails often originate from personal information found on public databases, people-search sites, and data broker platforms. To limit how often you're targeted, consider using a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services by visiting here\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a phishing message pretending to be from Amazon, report it right away. This helps Amazon investigate the scam and improve their ability to block similar messages in the future. You can forward the suspicious email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com, or submit it through Amazon\u2019s official reporting form.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam emails that pretend to be from Amazon are getting more realistic, but there are still clear ways to protect yourself. Use the Message Center to confirm any message tied to your account. Always double-check the sender's address, look for the smile logo in your inbox when supported, and never click on links unless you're certain they're safe. A few quick habits can go a long way in keeping your personal information secure.",

    "summary": "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.",
    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Building an open-source humanoid robot has traditionally been out of reach for most people due to high costs and complex proprietary systems. While robotics has made major strides in automation, healthcare, and research, accessible robot design still poses a challenge-especially for students, hobbyists, and small research teams. Most humanoid robots are expensive, hard to modify, and difficult to repair.",
      "That's why a new project from UC Berkeley is getting a lot of attention. The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open-source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components. It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all.",

      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.\u00a0 (Berkeley)",
      "Why accessible robot design is essential for innovation",
      "Building a robot from scratch usually means needing fancy equipment like CNC machines or custom electronics. Most people don't have access to those tools, which makes learning and experimentation hard. That's exactly what the Berkeley team wanted to change.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. The entire robot can be made with parts ordered online and printed at home. It costs less than $5,000 to build, which is far cheaper than most commercial humanoid robots.",
      "Inside Berkeley\u2019s open-source humanoid robot",
      "The robot stands about 39 inches tall and weighs just over 35 pounds. It's powered by modular actuators that use 3D-printed cycloidal gearboxes. These gearboxes distribute pressure across larger gear teeth, which helps the joints last longer and perform more like those found in high-end commercial robots.",
      "Because the design is modular, you don't have to build the whole robot all at once. You can start by printing and testing a single actuator, then gradually move on to assembling full limbs and eventually the entire humanoid. That's a big plus for anyone just getting started with robotics or working with limited resources.",
      "It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all. (Berkeley)",
      "Open source robotics with a strong community focus",
      "Everything about the BHL robot is open source. That includes the hardware design, control software, and even a custom teleoperation system that uses SteamVR. It's built to be easy to control, simple to repair, and endlessly customizable.",
      "There's also a growing community around the project. Builders are sharing tips, upgrades, and full robot builds on Discord and GitHub. That kind of collaboration is a big part of what makes accessible robot design so powerful-it brings more people into the conversation and helps everyone learn faster.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. (Berkeley)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light proves that accessible robot design doesn't have to mean cutting corners. With smart engineering, affordable parts, and a commitment to openness, the team behind BHL is making it easier than ever for anyone to dive into humanoid robotics. Whether you're a student, a maker, or just curious about how robots work, this is one project that shows what's possible when technology is made for everyone.",

      "What is Meta AI, and what does the \"Discover\" tab do?",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. Users can chat casually or deep dive into personal topics, from relationship questions to financial concerns or health issues.",
      "What sets Meta AI apart from other chatbots is the \"Discover\" tab, a public feed that displays shared conversations. It was meant to encourage community and creativity, letting users showcase interesting prompts and responses. Unfortunately, many didn\u2019t realize their conversations could be made public with just one tap, and the interface often fails to make the public/private distinction clear.",
      "The feature positions Meta AI as a kind of AI-powered social network, blending search, conversation, and status updates. But what sounds innovative on paper has opened the door to major privacy slip-ups.",
      "Why Meta AI\u2019s Discover tab is a privacy risk",
      "Privacy experts are sounding the alarm over Meta's Discover tab, calling it a serious breach of user trust. The feed surfaces chats containing legal dilemmas, therapy discussions, and deeply personal confessions, often linked to real accounts. In some cases, names and profile photos are visible. Although Meta says only shared chats appear, the interface makes it easy to hit \"share\" without realizing it means public exposure. Many assume the button saves the conversation privately. Worse, logging in with a public Instagram account can make shared AI activity publicly accessible by default, increasing the risk of identification.",
      "Some posts reveal sensitive health or legal issues, financial troubles, or relationship conflicts. Others include contact details or even audio clips. A few contain pleas like \"keep this private,\" written by users who didn't realize their messages would be broadcast. These aren't isolated incidents, and as more people use AI for personal support, the stakes will only get higher.",

      "Even casual users should take a moment to review their settings and chat history to make sure personal details aren\u2019t being shared without their knowledge.",
      "Are AI chat platforms really private?",
      "This issue isn\u2019t unique to Meta. Most AI chat tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini, store your conversations by default and may use them to improve performance, train future models, or develop new features. What many users don\u2019t realize is that their inputs can be reviewed by human moderators, flagged for analysis, or saved in training logs.",
      "Even if a platform says your chats are \"private,\" that usually just means they aren\u2019t visible to the public. It doesn\u2019t mean your data is encrypted, anonymous, or protected from internal access. In many cases, companies retain the right to use your conversations for product development unless you specifically opt out, and finding that opt-out isn't always straightforward.",
      "If you\u2019re signed in with a personal account that includes your real name, email address, or social media links, your activity may be easier to connect to your identity than you think. Combine that with questions about health, finances, or relationships, and you\u2019ve essentially created a detailed digital profile without meaning to.",
      "Some platforms now offer temporary chat modes or incognito settings, but these features are usually off by default. Unless you manually enable them, your data is likely being stored and possibly reviewed.",
      "The takeaway: AI chat platforms are not private by default. You need to actively manage your settings, be mindful of what you share, and stay informed about how your data is being handled behind the scenes.",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect your privacy when using AI chatbots",
      "AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but without the right precautions, they can also open you up to privacy risks. Whether you're using Meta AI, ChatGPT, or any other chatbot, here are some smart, proactive ways to protect yourself:",
      "1) Use aliases and avoid personal identifiers: Don\u2019t use your full name, birthday, address, or any details that could identify you. Even first names combined with other context can be risky.",
      "2) Never share sensitive information: Avoid discussing medical diagnoses, legal matters, bank account info, or anything you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of a search engine.",
      "3) Clear your chat history regularly: If you\u2019ve already shared sensitive info, go back and delete it. Many AI apps let you clear chat history through Settings or your account dashboard.",
      "4) Adjust privacy settings often: App updates can sometimes reset your preferences or introduce new default options. Even small changes to the interface can affect what\u2019s shared and how. It\u2019s a good idea to check your settings every few weeks to make sure your data is still protected.",
      "5) Use an identity theft protection service: Scammers actively look for exposed data, especially after a privacy slip. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft\u00a0for tips and recommendations.",
      "6) Use a VPN for extra privacy: A reliable VPN hides your IP address and location, making it harder for apps, websites, or bad actors to track your online activity. It also adds protection on public Wi-Fi, shielding your device from hackers who might try to snoop on your connection. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN.",
      "7) Don\u2019t link AI apps to your real social accounts: If possible, create a separate email address or dummy account for experimenting with AI tools. Keep your main profiles disconnected.\u00a0 To create a quick email alias you can use to keep your main accounts protected visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Meta\u2019s decision to turn chatbot prompts into social content has blurred the line between private and public in a way that catches many users off guard. Even if you think your chats are safe, a missed setting or default option can expose more than you intended. Before typing anything sensitive into Meta AI or any chatbot, pause. Check your privacy settings, review your chat history, and think carefully about what you're sharing. A few quick steps now can save you from bigger privacy headaches later.",

      "Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit with President Trump at the White House next Monday",
      "President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House on Monday. One of the most difficult questions on the table is what Gaza might look like without Hamas.",
      "Experts tell Fox News Digital that while the need for an alternative is clear, almost every proposed solution comes with serious structural, political and security limitations.",
      "John Hannah, a senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) and veteran of both Republican and Democratic administrations, said building an alternative to Hamas must happen in parallel with dismantling it.",
      "THE HISTORY OF GAZA AMID TRUMP'S PLAN TO REBUILD ENCLAVE",
      "Hamas terrorists emerge from the shadows as they surround Red Cross vehicles. (TPS-IL)",
      "\"Part of how you win is by showing there\u2019s a viable alternative,\" Hannah said. \"People need to see there\u2019s a future beyond Hamas\"",
      "That future, experts believe, lies in a non-Hamas technocratic government \u2013 comprised of Palestinians unaffiliated with either Hamas or the PLO \u2013 backed by a coalition of key Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the UAE.",
      "\"While a new administration in Gaza should be independent, some\u00a0symbolic link to the Palestinian Authority\u00a0could enhance its\u00a0legitimacy\u00a0with the Arabs.\u00a0Perhaps\u00a0Ramallah\u00a0could serve as a pass-through for paying salaries. But the PA won\u2019t call the shots,\" Hannah said.",
      "\"The default right now, if Israel ends up leaving Gaza, is Hamas,\" said Ghaith al-Omari, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"There is no one on the ground who can challenge them. And there is no Arab involvement without the defeat of Hamas. Not just a ceasefire \u2013 actual disarmament.\"",
      "Palestinians carry bags and boxes containing food and humanitarian aid packages delivered by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed organization, in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, June 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)",
      "At best, said al-Omari who served as the former executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine, the PA might offer a \"kosher stamp\" to satisfy Arab states, which have made clear they will only intervene in Gaza under a Palestinian national umbrella.",
      "TRUMP PRESSURES ISRAEL TO END GAZA CONFLICT AS HE EYES ABRAHAM ACCORDS EXPANSION",
      "\"Without that symbolic PA invitation, Egypt and others won\u2019t come in,\" said al-Omari. \"But they still need a political framework \u2013 some commitment to a two-state solution. Without that, they have absolutely no incentive to play a role in Gaza.\"",
      "Securing Israeli approval for any new Gaza administration is another major hurdle. An Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that any deal would need to include guarantees that Israel retains counterterrorism access to prevent Hamas from reemerging.",
      "\"Something like what exists in the West Bank \u2013 buffer zones, perimeter security, and the right of the IDF or Shin Bet to act on intelligence when needed,\" Hannah said.",
      "IDF forces operating in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip. (IDF Spokesman's Office)",
      "That framework, he noted, would require intensive American-led diplomacy with sustained presence and coordination.",
      "\"I can\u2019t see anyone else but the United States doing it \u2013 there are too many inner-Arab rivalries,\" Hannah said, \"No other actor has the relationships, resources or trust required to bridge the deep divides between Israel, Arab states and international players. Everyone\u2019s going to want the U.S. at the center of this. And there\u2019s no doubt President Trump wants to solve it.\"",
      "\"Qatar is the elephant in the room,\" said Hannah, \"They bring a lot of\u00a0much-needed\u00a0money,\u00a0but\u00a0they\u2019ve had\u00a0a\u00a0deeply problematic\u00a0relationship with Hamas. If they want a seat at the table, it has to be with strict conditions \u2013 money flowing through trusted, externally controlled channels. But they can\u2019t\u00a0be a key player in\u00a0this effort.\"",
      "The United Nations, meanwhile, is largely out. \"UNRWA\u2019s days are over,\" said Hannah. \"They can\u2019t run education or the economy in Gaza anymore. At most, the U.N. might endorse a U.S.-Arab-Israeli plan with a Security Council resolution \u2013 but they won\u2019t play an operational role.\"",

      "One proposal gaining quiet traction in Israeli and American circles is the idea of empowering local clans to establish self-governing enclaves.",
      "Joseph Braude, president of the Center for Peace Communications, has spoken extensively with activists on the ground and believes this model could mark the beginning of an alternative.",
      "\"It may not be realistic to talk about one civil administration managing all of Gaza right now,\" Braude said, \"But in discrete geographical enclaves within the strip, you can pilot non-Hamas self-rule. Local Gazans patrol internally while the IDF or another force secures the perimeter. \"",
      "\"There\u2019s a fiber of educated, civically minded individuals in Gaza \u2013 from engineers to teachers \u2013 who are not Islamists,\" he added, \"If vetted properly, they can manage administration, education and basic services. But you have to start by identifying who they are and what they actually believe.\"",
      "Braude pointed to one such case: Yasser Abu Shabab, a local militia leader. \"This is the first anti-Hamas militia to emerge in Gaza in a generation. He\u2019s a local fighter from a Bedouin clan with family ties to Egyptian forces battling ISIS in Sinai. He says he wants to invite civil servants to begin staffing an administration.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin meets with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on April 7, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)",
      "But not everyone agrees this is feasible. \"These groups are fragmented, displaced and lack the legitimacy or cohesion to govern,\" said al-Omari. \"You might use these militias to secure aid deliveries in a specific area, but they can\u2019t form the basis of governance.\"",
      "Dr. Michael Milstein, head of the Forum for Palestinian Studies at Tel Aviv University, told Fox News Digital, \"Since the war began, several attempts to promote clans as an alternative to Hamas have also failed, like the Doghmush clan, whose leaders were executed by Hamas in early 2024.\"",
      "\"Even now, figures like Abu Shabab in Rafah or the Barbakh family in Khan Younis are fringe cases,\" Milstein added. \"Hamas still controls most of the public space. Clans may offer localized solutions, but they are no cohesive or legitimate alternative. Many are openly loyal to Hamas.\"",

      "\"Many say, until Palestinians teach their children to love themselves more than they hate Israel, there will never be peace,\" Braude said, \"That\u2019s true. But who is actually working to foster a Palestinian leadership [that] does so? That\u2019s the challenge \u2013 and the opportunity \u2013 right now.\"",

      "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order lifting most U.S. sanctions on Syria, in a move experts say reflects growing recognition inside the administration that Syria, long a battleground for Iranian influence and Islamist terror, may now offer the U.S. a rare opportunity to reclaim regional leverage, counter enemies, and support allies like Israel and Jordan.",
      "At a White House press briefing Monday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \"This is another promise made and promise kept by this president,\" she said, referring to Trump\u2019s recent meeting with Syria\u2019s new transitional leader Ahmed al-Sharaa during a trip to Saudi Arabia. \"He\u2019s committed to supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors.\"",

A Syria that no longer hosts Iranian proxies, cooperates on counterterrorism, and integrates with Arab neighbors serves U.S. interests on every front.\"",
      "According to Schenker, Syria has taken steps the U.S. has long demanded: allowing inspections by the IAEA and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, sharing intelligence on ISIS, and cooperating with American liaison officers on counterterrorism. \"These groups have declared al-Sharaa an infidel. They themselves are being attacked by ISIS,\" he noted.",

      "Ali described the current moment as part of a broader Trump strategy: \"Now with Assad gone, it\u2019s another blow to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This creates an opportunity to coalesce the Sunni Arab states \u2013 either around the Abraham Accords or a growing anti-Iran coalition.\"",
      "The U.S. military still maintains a small but critical footprint in Syria \u2013 approximately 1,000 troops across three to four bases in the northeast \u2013 providing vital intelligence and rapid strike capability. \"That footprint has been one of our most important counterterrorism outposts,\" Ali said. \"We\u2019ve seen multiple targeted operations this year alone.\"",

      "Meanwhile, the diplomatic implications of Trump\u2019s move are drawing global attention. Syria\u2019s new leadership has publicly distanced itself from Iran, reportedly blocked Hezbollah weapon shipments, and dismantled multiple Iranian military posts across the country.",
      "\"The president is genuinely focused on expanding the Abraham Accords,\" said Schenker. \"He sees Syria as the next possible candidate.\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump is working towards lasting peace in the Middle East, which includes supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors. The President is empowering Syria\u2019s success by lifting sanctions on export controls while maintaining sanctions on terrorists and all other potential threats to the United States. The President made a promise to give Syria a chance to rebuild and thrive by lifting sanctions, and this President keeps his promises.\"",

Syria remains officially at war with the Jewish state, and while Sharaa has hinted at accepting the pre-1974 ceasefire lines, jihadist factions and Islamist groups within Syria remain staunchly opposed. \"There have already been reported assassination attempts on Sharaa,\" Schenker said. \"It\u2019s going to get harder if he moves from non-belligerency to full normalization.\"",
      "Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital, \"Syria has always been an open wound in the center of the region \u2013 an engine of instability\u2026 But if it stabilizes now, it unlocks a path for broader regional integration.

      "The law stipulates that any future inspection of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities by the IAEA must be approved by the country\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, according to Reuters. Iran maintains that the IAEA sided with the U.S. and Israel in the recent conflict.

      "After major military setbacks, Iran\u2019s IRGC faces a turning point. Experts explain its roots, power, and whether its reign of repression and terror can endure.",
      "Once a fringe militia born of revolution, Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has grown into the regime\u2019s most feared and powerful force. But according to Dr. Afshon Ostovar, a leading expert on Iran and author of \"Vanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran's Revolutionary Guards,\" said the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes in Iran may have permanently altered its trajectory.",

(AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"What the IRGC tried to achieve over the last 25 years is basically toast,\" Ostovar told Fox News Digital, \"Their campaign to build a military deterrent at home through missiles and nuclear enrichment, and to expand regionally through proxies, has essentially collapsed.\"",
      "Founded in the wake of the 1979 revolution, the IRGC was created to safeguard and spread the Islamic Republic\u2019s values \u2014 often through violence. Ostovar describes how its legitimacy evolved over time, initially drawn from the overthrow of the Shah, then the Iran-Iraq War, and later through the manufactured narrative of an eternal struggle with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, Senior Director of FDD's Iran Program Behnam Ben Taleblu, told Fox News Digital the IRGC\u2019s origin reflects a deep mistrust of Iran\u2019s traditional military, which had remained loyal to the Shah.",
      "\"The IRGC were created through efforts to collect pro-regime armed gangs called Komitehs. They enforced revolutionary edicts and developed a parallel and ideological military force due to clerical skepticism in the national army,\" he explained.",

      "\"The IRGC are tasked with preserving and defending the revolution in Iran,\" Taleblu said. \"That\u2019s one reason why the 1979 Islamic Revolution has not been tamed, nor has the regime\u2019s extremism lost any luster. If anything, terrorism and hostage-taking have continued.\"",
      "\"They created a boogeyman in the U.S. and Israel,\" Ostovar added. \"But today, that ideology no longer resonates with most Iranians. The majority want better relations with the West and are tired of the regime\u2019s isolationist stance.\"",
      "Today, the IRGC is deeply intertwined with the clerical elite. \"The IRGC and the clerical elite are partners in power, treating Iran as a springboard to export their revolution,\" Taleblu noted.",
      "EXILED IRANIAN PRINCE TELLS TRUMP HE CAN BE 'ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT PEACEMAKERS' AMID TALK OF REGIME CHANGE",
      "Over the past year, Iran has suffered a series of strategic defeats: Hezbollah has been degraded in Lebanon, Hamas crippled in Gaza, Syria effectively lost, and Iranian military infrastructure \u2014 including nuclear and missile sites \u2014 destroyed in many cases by U.S. and Israeli strikes. Ostovar says these losses have decimated the IRGC\u2019s regional footprint and forced the regime to reevaluate its strategy.",
      "\"They can try to rebuild everything \u2014 but that would take too long and be too difficult,\" he said. \"More likely, we\u2019ll see them repress harder at home and lean on China and Russia to rebuild conventional military capabilities like air defense and advanced jets.\"",
      "Members of the Iranian revolutionary guard march during a parade. The IRGC is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. A large part of its work is to covertly operate outside of Iran. (Reuters)",
      "Internally, the IRGC\u2019s economic empire is also under growing strain. Sanctions, cyberattacks, and battlefield losses have made operations far more difficult. Ostovar said that foreign banks avoid any connection with Iran out of fear they may inadvertently deal with IRGC-linked entities, forcing the group to operate through front companies abroad. \"They\u2019ve lost a lot, and now they\u2019ll have to redirect their limited resources to rebuild. That\u2019s going to stretch them even thinner.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY",
      "Despite these pressures, both Ostovar and Taleblu agree that the IRGC is unlikely to turn against the regime. \"Much like the regime elite, the IRGC is at a crossroads,\" Taleblu said. \"They have lost much of their strategic brain trust, but are likely to remain loyal for a combination of ideological and material reasons \u2014 so long as the status quo doesn\u2019t change.\"",
      "Looking ahead, Iran may shift focus inward, relying more on domestic repression than on external terror. \"They can\u2019t get weapons into Gaza. They\u2019ve lost access to Lebanon. They may still attempt terrorism, but they\u2019ve failed repeatedly \u2014 especially against Israeli targets,\" Ostovar said. \"In contrast, repressing their own people is something they can do easily.\"",
      "He warns that Iran could become \"more insular, more autocratic \u2014 more like North Korea than what it is today.\" While regime collapse is always a possibility, Ostovar believes autocracies are often resilient. \"Look at Venezuela or Cuba \u2014 they\u2019ve run their countries into the ground but still hold on to power.\"",

      "Ostovar thinks change \u2014 and not for the better \u2014 could come via generational shift. \"The IRGC\u2019s younger cadre is less religious but no less hardline,\" he said. \"They may not care about hijabs, but they\u2019ve spent the last two decades fighting the U.S. and Israel in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. That\u2019s the war they know.\"",
      "Some reformist elements within the regime envision a different path \u2014 one focused on normalization and growth. \"They want to preserve the regime not by fighting the world, but by opening up to it,\" Ostovar said. \"They look more to Vietnam or China as models.\"",

      "Fatal floods in Texas that left thousands scrambling for safety with little warning have sparked a fresh round of scrutiny of Trump administration cuts to the National Weather Service.",
      "At least 81 people were dead and many others were missing Sunday evening after floodwaters surged through Texas Hill Country, an area known as \u201cflash flood alley.\u201d",
      "Within hours of the deluge early Friday, some Texas officials were critical of the NWS, saying forecasts underestimated the rainfall. Sunday, President Donald Trump rejected the idea of investigating whether NWS cuts had left key vacancies, and the White House said claims that NWS cuts had anything to do with the tragedy were \u201cdisgusting.\u201d",
      "Independent meteorologists and a former NWS official said warnings issued in the run-up to the flooding were about as timely and accurate as could be expected with the weather data available in real time. Predicting extreme rain and flash flooding beyond several hours is challenging, they said, and it is also not easy to ensure urgent warnings reach those most at risk.",
      "\u201cThe forecasting was good. The warnings were good. It\u2019s always about getting people to receive the message,\u201d said Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist based in Wisconsin. \u201cIt appears that is one of the biggest contributors \u2014 that last mile.\u201d",
      "The meteorologists said they did not think understaffed offices were a primary factor in the tragic outcome, even though the NWS has leadership gaps after a rash of staffing cuts.",
      "Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union that represents government employees, said the San Antonio weather forecasting office did not have two of its top positions filled \u2014 a permanent science officer (a role that conducts training and is in charge of implementing new technology) or a warning coordination meteorologist (who coordinates with the media and is the public face of the office), though there are employees acting in those leadership roles. Overall, Fahy said, the offices had enough meteorologists to respond to the event.",
      "\u201cThe WFOs [weather forecasting offices] had adequate staffing and resources as they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,\u201d Fahy said Saturday, but he added that he was concerned about the unfilled senior positions and vacuums of leadership.",
      "In a statement, the NWS said it was \u201cheartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County.\u201d It did not address questions about staffing but provided a detailed timeline of the warnings it sent out.",
      "Some Texas officials have suggested the National Weather Center forecast did not convey the storm\u2019s threat, while others said they were grateful for timely alerts from the agency.",
      "\u201cThe original forecast that we received on Wednesday from the National Weather Service predicted 3 to 6 inches of rain in the Concho Valley and 4 to 8 inches of rain in the Hill Country,\u201d Texas Emergency Management Chief W. Nim Kidd said at a news conference Friday. \u201cThe amount of rain that fell in this specific location was never in any of those forecasts nonetheless.\u201d",
      "The National Weather Center indicated Kerrville, Texas, and its surrounding areas could be at risk of flash flooding Thursday, according to the National Weather Service timeline. Then, NWS Austin/San Antonio issued a flood watch at 1:18 p.m. Thursday into Friday morning. It issued its urgent flash flood warnings for Kerr County at 1:14 a.m.",
      "Andy Brown, the Travis County judge, or chief executive, thanked the NWS for its alerts. Eric Carter, the county\u2019s chief emergency management coordinator, described the weather service as being \u201cvery proactive in their warnings.\u201d",
      "The agency noted that it sent out a flash flood warning with tags of \u201cconsiderable\u201d or \u201ccatastrophic\u201d at 1:14 a.m. CT Friday, which would trigger \u200b\u200bwireless emergency alerts on enabled mobile devices.",
      "\u201cFlash Flood Warnings were issued on the night of July 3 and in the early morning of July 4, giving preliminary lead times of more than three hours,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Trump administration this spring laid off NWS employees and also offered buyouts and early retirements. By early June, the weather service had lost about 600 employees. Many veteran workers left, along with employees on probation and those recently hired or promoted.",
      "Some NWS offices have experienced staffing reductions of more than 40%, and the agency has scrambled to fill critical roles at some forecasting offices. At least eight offices stopped operating 24 hours a day this spring as a result, and some have suspended weather balloon launches.",
      "In May, more than 40% of the country\u2019s weather forecasting offices had staffing vacancy rates above 20%. The cuts prompted all of the living former directors of the NWS to write a letter expressing concern over staffing levels and future budget cuts.",
      "\u201cOur worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life. We know that\u2019s a nightmare shared by those on the forecasting front lines\u2014and by the people who depend on their efforts,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Compared with many forecasting offices across the country, the Texas offices remain relatively well-staffed.",
      "Fahy said the San Antonio/Austin weather forecasting office is operating with 11 staff meteorologists and is down six employees from its typical full staffing level of 26. He also said the nearby San Angelo office, which issued warnings for parts of central Texas, is short four staff members from its usual staffing level of 23. The meteorologist-in-charge position \u2014 the office\u2019s top leadership position \u2014 is not permanently filled. The office is also without a senior hydrologist.",
      "\u201cIn San Angelo, there is no hydrologist, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Fahy said. Hydrologists analyze stream flow and play a key role in flood response.",
      "Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said the city will look at whether its own emergency notifications were robust enough to warn residents.",
      "\u201cWe know questions are being asked about the emergency notification, and while it is not the time to speculate, local and regional partners are committed to a full review of the events and systems in place,\u201d Rice said at a news conference Sunday. \u201cAt the appropriate time, we will take clear steps to strengthen our future preparedness. We owe that commitment to the families who are suffering and every member of our community.\u201d",
      "Prominent independent meteorologists who have been critical of NWS staffing and budget cuts in the past have said federal meteorologists on the ground issued timely warnings.",
      "Alan Gerard, the former director of the analysis and understanding branch at the National Severe Storms Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in a blog post that the Austin/San Antonio forecasting office did a good job communicating the risks as quickly as possible, despite the unfilled leadership positions.",
      "\u201cObviously, having both of these positions vacant for a prolonged time is not optimal, and certainly could have had negative impacts at some level,\u201d Gerard wrote. \u201cHowever, just looking at the actual warning services that NWS provided during the event, they were solid and provided the level of warning and alerts that the public should expect to receive for an event such as this.\u201d",
      "Matt Lanza, a Houston-based meteorologist, said there were no initial indications that staffing levels or budget cuts played a role in the tragedy.",
      "Vagasky, the Wisconsin meteorologist, said predicting flash flooding and extreme rain is notoriously difficult.",
      "\u201cQuantitative precipitation forecasting, called QPF, is one of the hardest things meteorologists have to do. You have to get the right location, the right amount, the right timing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were aware this was a significant event, and they were messaging that.\u201d",
      "Vagasky said the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry moved into Texas and fed tropical moisture to severe thunderstorms, which stalled out over central Texas and pummeled the region with extreme precipitation.",
      "He added that the cadence by which forecasters indicated increasing concern fit with what weather models were showing and what he would expect.",
      "The Texas Hill Country is often called \u201cflash flood alley\u201d because its topography can funnel and quickly swell rivers. Knowing precisely where the rain will fall is key for hydrologic models to understand where flood impacts would be worse.",
      "\u201cThe forecasts this week were for 4 to 7, 5 to 9 inches of rain, somewhere in there. And some models were showing higher amounts on top of that. Knowing is that higher amount going to fall 3 miles this way or 3 miles that way has a big impact on what the ultimate results are,\u201d Vagasky said. \u201cUnfortunately, the science just isn\u2019t at that point where you can say, \u2018OK, I know at this specific latitude and longitude, we\u2019re going to get this much rain.\u2019\u201d",
      "The overnight timing of the heaviest rain and the floodwaters\u2019 beginning to rise is a nightmare scenario for forecasters, Vagasky said.",
      "\u201cSevere weather response in the middle of the night is one of the biggest challenges. That\u2019s when we see the most tornado fatalities and the most flooding fatalities. People are asleep. They can\u2019t see the tornado or the water rising,\u201d he said. \u201cDid people have their emergency alerts turned on on their phones?\u201d",
      "Vagasky, who has criticized staffing reductions and cuts to weather balloon releases at the NWS, said he did not think better staffing would have prevented the tragedy.",
      "\u201cThose are important positions that do need to be filled,\u201d he said, but he added that it \u201cprobably wasn\u2019t a significant contributor to what happened.\u201d",
      "Vagasky said there is plenty of room to improve quantitative precipitation forecasting that could help forecasters identify threats earlier. Such research is at risk if the administration cuts NOAA\u2019s funding as it has outlined, he said.",
      "\u201cThe big concern is the latest budget request. If it goes through Congress the way the administration wants, it shuts down all the NOAA research labs, which are the labs doing the work to improve that forecasting.\u201d"

      "The agency noted that it sent out a flash flood warning with tags of \u201cconsiderable\u201d or \u201ccatastrophic\u201d at 1:14 a.m. CT Friday, which would trigger \u200b\u200bwireless emergency alerts on enabled mobile devices.",
      "\u201cFlash Flood Warnings were issued on the night of July 3 and in the early morning of July 4, giving preliminary lead times of more than three hours,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Trump administration this spring laid off NWS employees and also offered buyouts and early retirements. By early June, the weather service had lost about 600 employees. Many veteran workers left, along with employees on probation and those recently hired or promoted.",
      "Some NWS offices have experienced staffing reductions of more than 40%, and the agency has scrambled to fill critical roles at some forecasting offices. At least eight offices stopped operating 24 hours a day this spring as a result, and some have suspended weather balloon launches.",
      "In May, more than 40% of the country\u2019s weather forecasting offices had staffing vacancy rates above 20%. The cuts prompted all of the living former directors of the NWS to write a letter expressing concern over staffing levels and future budget cuts.",
      "\u201cOur worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life. We know that\u2019s a nightmare shared by those on the forecasting front lines\u2014and by the people who depend on their efforts,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Compared with many forecasting offices across the country, the Texas offices remain relatively well-staffed.",
      "Fahy said the San Antonio/Austin weather forecasting office is operating with 11 staff meteorologists and is down six employees from its typical full staffing level of 26. He also said the nearby San Angelo office, which issued warnings for parts of central Texas, is short four staff members from its usual staffing level of 23. The meteorologist-in-charge position \u2014 the office\u2019s top leadership position \u2014 is not permanently filled. The office is also without a senior hydrologist.",
      "\u201cIn San Angelo, there is no hydrologist, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Fahy said. Hydrologists analyze stream flow and play a key role in flood response.",
      "Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said the city will look at whether its own emergency notifications were robust enough to warn residents.",
      "\u201cWe know questions are being asked about the emergency notification, and while it is not the time to speculate, local and regional partners are committed to a full review of the events and systems in place,\u201d Rice said at a news conference Sunday. \u201cAt the appropriate time, we will take clear steps to strengthen our future preparedness. We owe that commitment to the families who are suffering and every member of our community.\u201d",
      "Prominent independent meteorologists who have been critical of NWS staffing and budget cuts in the past have said federal meteorologists on the ground issued timely warnings.",
      "Alan Gerard, the former director of the analysis and understanding branch at the National Severe Storms Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in a blog post that the Austin/San Antonio forecasting office did a good job communicating the risks as quickly as possible, despite the unfilled leadership positions.",
      "\u201cObviously, having both of these positions vacant for a prolonged time is not optimal, and certainly could have had negative impacts at some level,\u201d Gerard wrote. \u201cHowever, just looking at the actual warning services that NWS provided during the event, they were solid and provided the level of warning and alerts that the public should expect to receive for an event such as this.\u201d",
      "Matt Lanza, a Houston-based meteorologist, said there were no initial indications that staffing levels or budget cuts played a role in the tragedy.",
      "Vagasky, the Wisconsin meteorologist, said predicting flash flooding and extreme rain is notoriously difficult.",
      "\u201cQuantitative precipitation forecasting, called QPF, is one of the hardest things meteorologists have to do. You have to get the right location, the right amount, the right timing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were aware this was a significant event, and they were messaging that.\u201d",
      "Vagasky said the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry moved into Texas and fed tropical moisture to severe thunderstorms, which stalled out over central Texas and pummeled the region with extreme precipitation.",
      "He added that the cadence by which forecasters indicated increasing concern fit with what weather models were showing and what he would expect.",
      "The Texas Hill Country is often called \u201cflash flood alley\u201d because its topography can funnel and quickly swell rivers. Knowing precisely where the rain will fall is key for hydrologic models to understand where flood impacts would be worse.",
      "\u201cThe forecasts this week were for 4 to 7, 5 to 9 inches of rain, somewhere in there. And some models were showing higher amounts on top of that. Knowing is that higher amount going to fall 3 miles this way or 3 miles that way has a big impact on what the ultimate results are,\u201d Vagasky said. \u201cUnfortunately, the science just isn\u2019t at that point where you can say, \u2018OK, I know at this specific latitude and longitude, we\u2019re going to get this much rain.\u2019\u201d",
      "The overnight timing of the heaviest rain and the floodwaters\u2019 beginning to rise is a nightmare scenario for forecasters, Vagasky said.",
      "\u201cSevere weather response in the middle of the night is one of the biggest challenges. That\u2019s when we see the most tornado fatalities and the most flooding fatalities. People are asleep. They can\u2019t see the tornado or the water rising,\u201d he said. \u201cDid people have their emergency alerts turned on on their phones?\u201d",
      "Vagasky, who has criticized staffing reductions and cuts to weather balloon releases at the NWS, said he did not think better staffing would have prevented the tragedy.",
      "\u201cThose are important positions that do need to be filled,\u201d he said, but he added that it \u201cprobably wasn\u2019t a significant contributor to what happened.\u201d",
      "Vagasky said there is plenty of room to improve quantitative precipitation forecasting that could help forecasters identify threats earlier. Such research is at risk if the administration cuts NOAA\u2019s funding as it has outlined, he said.",
      "\u201cThe big concern is the latest budget request. If it goes through Congress the way the administration wants, it shuts down all the NOAA research labs, which are the labs doing the work to improve that forecasting.\u201d"

      "Ramirez, 23, from Midland, was at the church in Kerrville with weariness in his eyes. He was getting by \u201cminute to minute, second to second,\u201d he said.",
      "One of his cousins, Devyn Smith, who had been at HTR Campgrounds outside Ingram when the Guadalupe River burst from its banks, had been found late Friday and was recovering at Peterson Regional Medical Center, he said.",
      "Smith, 23, was found about 20 miles downriver outside Center Point in a tree, Ramirez said.",
      "But she was one of six who\u2019d been at the campground outside Ingram in Kerr County.",
      "Ramirez said he still was awaiting word of his aunt, Tasha Ramos; another cousin, Kendall Ramos; his stepfather, Cody Crossland; his mother, Michelle Crossland; and his uncle Joel Ramos.",
      "The campground had been a destination spot for years, where the family had gone to enjoy the river since he was a small boy, Ramirez said.",
      "According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, rapidly emerging thunderstorms in the Texas Hill Country produced near 100-year flooding. The Guadalupe River marked 23.4 feet on a flood stage chart, above \u201cmajor flooding\u201d indicators, early Friday, according to NOAA.",
      "The shocking rise of floodwaters, possibly boosted by a \u201cflood wave\u201d that rolled along the Guadalupe and could have instantly raised its depth, left vehicles abandoned, mobile homes and businesses totaled and summer camps usually busy with holiday weekend activities wiped of humanity and surrounded by muddy sediment.",
      "The devastating flooding has so far claimed the lives of at least 51 people across the state, with dozens more missing, including 27 children who were at Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp for girls. Kerr County has been the hardest hit, with officials there reporting at least 43 deaths, including 15 children, as search-and-rescue efforts continue.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott, who visited Kerrville on Saturday, declared a state of disaster for 20 Texas counties affected by the flooding and proclaimed Sunday will be a day of prayer for victims of the extreme weather event. He said he has also requested federal disaster relief.",
      "Ramirez\u2019s family had been asleep when the Guadalupe River\u2019s waters began to rise in the early-morning hours Friday.",
      "\u201cThey slept in the truck. They didn\u2019t think it was safe in a tent\u201d because they had heard about the storm, Ramirez said, relaying what his cousin had told the family. There were two trucks: his mother and father and teenage cousin in one, and his aunt, uncle and Smith in the other.",
      "It was his aunt who awoke first. The family members scrambled to get to the top of the trucks, climbing through sunroofs, Ramirez said.",
      "\u201cThey lost my uncle first\u201d to the water\u2019s heavy current, Ramirez recalled. \u201cHe had tried to keep them all together and couldn\u2019t hold on.\u201d",
      "His mother, stepfather and Smith had managed to get to higher ground and had planned to go get help.",
      "\u201cWe found their truck in Ingram, against a tree, crushed and flipped, not far from the campground,\u201d he said.",
      "His mother\u2019s purse was inside when the family found the truck Saturday, after a day of searching.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the only boy, so I\u2019m trying to hold it together for the rest of the family,\u201d Ramirez said."

      "This summer\u2019s big sales events could offer some of the best bargains before the ongoing trade war threatens to scramble fall and winter shopping.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s springtime pause on his sweeping global tariffs is set to expire Wednesday. He has indicated the July 9 deadline isn\u2019t set in stone, and his treasury secretary said Sunday that higher rates would kick in Aug. 1 if agreements aren\u2019t reached by then. So without a flurry of trade deals with dozens of countries in the coming weeks, the import taxes are set to drive up the prices of numerous overseas goods for businesses and consumers alike.",
      "In the meantime, major retailers are rolling out deep midseason discounts to keep customers spending despite widespread pessimism. Consumer sentiment has improved from its dismal levels months ago but remains sharply lower than this time last year. The promotions could run as much as 40% off during Home Depot\u2019s 4th of July Sale (June 19-July 9) and Target\u2019s Circle Week (July 6-12) and up to 50% off during Amazon Prime Day (July 8-11) and Walmart Deals (July 8-13).",
      "What happens with prices after the summer sales events is anyone\u2019s guess. Retail executives, including at Walmart, and major consumer brands have warned that tariff-fueled price increases are likely as the year wears on and the inventories they\u2019ve built up dwindle. Some analysts are already seeing signs of those hikes picking up, particularly at department stores, CNBC reported last week.",
      "To reduce some of the guesswork for shoppers, NBC News is tracking online price levels for dozens of items at Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Home Depot to determine when and how much they may fluctuate throughout the rest of the year.",
      "Rather than sweep up hundreds or thousands of items across these retailers\u2019 sprawling e-commerce marketplaces, the tracker zeroes in on a basket of 230 items that tend to be purchased less frequently than, say, groceries or household staples. They range from appliances like dishwashers and toasters to jewelry, smartphones and running shoes.",
      "The NBC News Price Tracker is powered by the e-commerce price-tracking platform Bright Data, which is monitoring 27 to 61 items for each of the five retailers.",
      "The Price Tracker can\u2019t identify what causes prices to rise or fall, so it\u2019s impossible to determine whether any changes reflect retailers passing along tariff expenses to shoppers. But the tool can help consumers plan their purchases at a time when goods from certain countries, such as China, or with specific components, like steel or aluminum, are disproportionately subject to steeper levies.",
      "The summer sales period offers something of a starting line, coinciding with broader trade policy changes and representing the last major discounting spree before back-to-school shopping around Labor Day, followed by early-bird holiday sales leading up to Black Friday.",
      "Since Bright Data began tracking prices of 230 items for NBC News on March 2, about 29% of them saw price hikes, with an average increase of nearly 6%. Home Depot and Target saw the most price hikes, affecting 39% and 37%, respectively, of those tracked since March. And over roughly the last month, price increases have been more common than reductions: In all but one week since May 30, twice as many products increased in price than decreased across the four major retailers.",
      "(A Home Depot spokesperson said the company hasn\u2019t taken tariff-related pricing actions and attributed any price swings to routine promotional cycles. Target didn\u2019t comment.)",
      "So far, there are few signs of broad-based pricing changes that clearly correspond to tariff policy moves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been hard to draw a line connecting the dots between things that have been said, things that are happening in the world, and certain items that we know are manufactured in those areas,\u201d said Jennifer Burns, Bright Data\u2019s director of public relations and communications.",
      "But a few patterns are emerging in the run-up to this month\u2019s discounting sprees:",
      "Kitchen appliances: It might not be the best time to make major upgrades in the kitchen. Prices on larger appliances like freezers, stoves and ovens are up, particularly at Home Depot, where 39% of the items we tracked increased in price. The highest individual price increase was 53.1% on a freezer and refrigerator unit. At Best Buy, prices took a sharp dive from mid-April to mid-June but have since rebounded to slightly above their springtime levels.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/pelvic-women-arousal-genital-disorder-treatment-rcna216197",
    "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Up to 4% of women may be affected by a  condition that can cause intense genital pain, burning, buzzing and tingling and other distressing sensations.",
    "story": [
      "Mandy Funk, 37, remembers when her body began to betray her.",
      "As a college junior, she began to have episodes in which her body would act as if it were aroused for no reason. Sometimes, she says, it felt like hot sauce had been slathered over her genital area. She had to give up tight-fitting clothes and horseback riding, her lifelong love. Often the pain was so intense that she couldn't sit down.",
      "Funk struggled for years to find a doctor who understood her symptoms.",
      "She eventually learned she had developed a condition called persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), which led to treatment. Funk, who, with her husband, owns an electrical contracting company in Goessel, Kansas, did eventually get her life, at least partly, back on track. She\u2019s especially happy she can ride horses again with her children, although she still sometimes experiences flare-ups.",
      "Funk is fortunate to have gotten a diagnosis and help, experts say. Many doctors are unaware of the disorder, although there is some growing research.",
      "The condition started to come to light only in 2001, when researchers at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, New Jersey, described the experiences of five women with bouts of arousal symptoms that seemed to arise out of nothing. In the report, published in the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, the authors, Sandra Leiblum and Sharon Nathan, identified the key feature of the disorder as \u201cpersistent physiological arousal in the absence of conscious feelings of sexual desire.\u201d",
      "The condition was initially called \u201cpersistent sexual arousal syndrome,\u201d but then \u201csexual\u201d was replaced with \u201cgenital\u201d because it really had nothing to do with sex, said Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a urologist and director of San Diego Sexual Medicine.",
      "Not long after the 2001 report, Leiblum, then a professor of psychiatry at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, concluded that psychology alone wouldn\u2019t explain all the symptoms the five women were experiencing. Leiblum began sending patients to Goldstein, who at the time was a specialist in sexual dysfunction at Boston University.",
      "It\u2019s estimated that 1% to 4% of women may have symptoms of the disorder, although incidence could be significantly higher, said Caroline Pukall, a professor of psychology at Queens University in Canada. Many women aren\u2019t comfortable discussing a topic they see as private, even with their doctors, she said. Another issue could be people\u2019s difficulty imagining arousal could be a bad thing.",
      "\u201cMaybe it\u2019s all the assumptions about how arousal is supposed to feel,\u201d Pukall said. \u201cMost experience body and mind working together in a really pleasurable way. So they have no framework to understand this in.\u201d",
      "Pukall said that may help explain why so few in the medical community are aware of PGAD, adding, \u201cCertainly, most primary care providers have not heard of it at all.\u201d",
      "To raise awareness, Goldstein and other experts \u2014 including doctors who focus on sexual dysfunction, psychologists and physical therapists \u2014 formed a panel to share what they had learned about PGAD.",
      "In 2021, the panel published a report in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, offering a road map to determining possible causes and treatments for the \u201cextremely distressing sexual health condition,\u201d which \u201cmay be more prevalent than previously recognized,\u201d the authors wrote.",
      "They noted that symptoms might first appear in the vaginal region, the pelvic area or the spinal cord.",
      "According to Goldstein and colleagues, diagnosis of PGAD, at a minimum, would require that a woman had:",
      "Persistent or recurrent, unwanted or intrusive, distressing sensations of genital arousal.Symptoms that had lasted for three or more months.Sensations that couldn\u2019t be associated with any sexual interest, thoughts or fantasies.Buzzing, tingling, burning, twitching, itching or pain, along with a sensation of arousal. While the sensations would most commonly be felt in the clitoris, they could also be felt in the vulva, the vagina, the urethra, the bladder and other locations in the vicinity of the pelvis.",
      "Persistent or recurrent, unwanted or intrusive, distressing sensations of genital arousal.",
      "Symptoms that had lasted for three or more months.",
      "Sensations that couldn\u2019t be associated with any sexual interest, thoughts or fantasies.",
      "Buzzing, tingling, burning, twitching, itching or pain, along with a sensation of arousal. While the sensations would most commonly be felt in the clitoris, they could also be felt in the vulva, the vagina, the urethra, the bladder and other locations in the vicinity of the pelvis.",
      "The 2021 report included findings from a small functional MRI study that analyzed brain scans of three women with PGAD and 12 healthy volunteers. The healthy volunteers were asked to think about sex while in the machine, and those with PGAD were scanned when they were feeling symptoms of the condition.",
      "The area of the brain that lit up when the healthy volunteers were thinking about sex, the paracentral lobule, also shone much more brightly when the women with PGAD were symptomatic.",
      "PGAD is primarily a problem of too much unwanted, unrelenting sensation going to the brain, Goldstein said. While the paracentral lobule has other functions, in the context of PGAD, it\u2019s a key sensory region of the brain involved in processing information from the urogenital areas, such as the clitoris, vulva and perineum; the pelvic organs, including the bladder, urethra, vagina, cervix and rectum; and the lower limbs, especially the toes, he said.",
      "More recently, a small study by German researchers using brain scans was published in Scientific Reports in February, with 26 patients diagnosed with PGAD and 26 healthy volunteers. Areas of the brain associated with the disorder were activated as expected, but the researchers said it was unclear whether specific symptoms were connected to the different pattern of brain activity. The findings gave potential areas of focus for future research, they wrote.",
      "Ultimately, the earlier scanning study may have been more telling.",
      "\u201cWe know that irritated sensory nerves and nerve roots are associated with PGAD and excess brain activity in the paracentral lobule,\u201d Goldstein said.",
      "But that\u2019s still not enough, he said.",
      "\u201cNerve irritation or nerve root irritation can be caused by a variety of factors, including injuries, compression, infections and inflammation,\u201d he said, adding that if the message from irritated nerves gets to the paracentral lobule, a woman might experience unwanted genital arousal.",
      "If doctors could better identify the exact pathway that led to unwanted arousal, more women could be helped, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s our job as sex detectives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is that we can now really help improve quality of life in about two-thirds of women.\u201d",
      "In general, specialists will treat the underlying problem that triggered the disorder to see whether the arousals resolve.",
      "What causes the disorder?",
      "PGAD can result from many conditions that irritate the nerves, from back injuries to changes in dosing of certain antidepressants.",
      "Dr. Sharon Parish, a professor of clinical medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, points to the first case she ever saw: that of a woman who had tripped at work and injured her hip a year earlier. By the time the patient was referred to Parish by her OB-GYN, she was struggling to find a position that didn\u2019t cause her pain.",
      "For Shari Stewart, 63, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, the bottom came when she went to a doctor for help with the pain she was experiencing. She had searched for her symptoms online for years and finally determined she must have PGAD.",
      "\u201cI told him I think I have PGAD,\u201d Stewart remembered. \u201cI have all these symptoms, and before I could show him the list, he said, \u2018God, I wish my wife had that.\u2019 And then he chuckled.\u201d",
      "Stewart doesn\u2019t think the doctor ever took her seriously.",
      "Even after the 2021 consensus report, a very small percentage of doctors know about the disorder, especially in primary care or  internal medicine, Goldstein said. \u201cI estimate only about 5% to 10% of all providers are aware of PGAD.\u201d",
      "Parish recommends that women who suspect they\u2019ve developed PGAD search the International Society for the Study of Women\u2019s Sexual Health website for a list of providers who are familiar with the condition and can offer treatments.",
      "Knowing just what went wrong is what helped April Patterson, 45, get her life back.",
      "Patterson, a physical therapist from Los Angeles, started having pain during intercourse when she was 21. \u201cIt was like sciatic pain,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would just shoot down my leg, during intercourse only.\u201d",
      "Then the pain started to arise more often and in more places. \u201cEverything felt like it was tingling, burning, buzzing,\u201d she said.",
      "After years of pain, one day, Patterson saw a flyer advertising a presentation on pelvic pain related to nerve issues. \u201cI thought, this is what I have,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to go to this meeting.\u201d",
      "That was when Patterson first heard Goldstein talk.",
      "After several X-rays and a brain scan, Patterson\u2019s symptoms and pain were traced to herniated discs in her lower spine. After she was treated with a nerve block, her pelvic symptoms were relieved.",
      "A spine surgeon repaired the damaged discs and widened the opening in the spinal canal where it was too narrow. The procedure completely fixed Patterson\u2019s PGAD and most of her pain.",
      "The experience made Patterson more aware of how much women keep to themselves. In questionnaires, she now asks her patients about unwanted persistent arousal, as well as pelvic pain and other related symptoms.",
      "\u201cAnd then we can get into the conversation,\u201d she said."

      "This summer\u2019s big sales events could offer some of the best bargains before the ongoing trade war threatens to scramble fall and winter shopping.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s springtime pause on his sweeping global tariffs is set to expire Wednesday. He has indicated the July 9 deadline isn\u2019t set in stone, and his treasury secretary said Sunday that higher rates would kick in Aug. 1 if agreements aren\u2019t reached by then. So without a flurry of trade deals with dozens of countries in the coming weeks, the import taxes are set to drive up the prices of numerous overseas goods for businesses and consumers alike.",
      "In the meantime, major retailers are rolling out deep midseason discounts to keep customers spending despite widespread pessimism. Consumer sentiment has improved from its dismal levels months ago but remains sharply lower than this time last year. The promotions could run as much as 40% off during Home Depot\u2019s 4th of July Sale (June 19-July 9) and Target\u2019s Circle Week (July 6-12) and up to 50% off during Amazon Prime Day (July 8-11) and Walmart Deals (July 8-13).",

Retail executives, including at Walmart, and major consumer brands have warned that tariff-fueled price increases are likely as the year wears on and the inventories they\u2019ve built up dwindle. Some analysts are already seeing signs of those hikes picking up, particularly at department stores, CNBC reported last week.",
      "To reduce some of the guesswork for shoppers, NBC News is tracking online price levels for dozens of items at Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Home Depot to determine when and how much they may fluctuate throughout the rest of the year.",
      "Rather than sweep up hundreds or thousands of items across these retailers\u2019 sprawling e-commerce marketplaces, the tracker zeroes in on a basket of 230 items that tend to be purchased less frequently than, say, groceries or household staples. They range from appliances like dishwashers and toasters to jewelry, smartphones and running shoes.",
      "The NBC News Price Tracker is powered by the e-commerce price-tracking platform Bright Data, which is monitoring 27 to 61 items for each of the five retailers.",
      "The Price Tracker can\u2019t identify what causes prices to rise or fall, so it\u2019s impossible to determine whether any changes reflect retailers passing along tariff expenses to shoppers. But the tool can help consumers plan their purchases at a time when goods from certain countries, such as China, or with specific components, like steel or aluminum, are disproportionately subject to steeper levies.",
      "The summer sales period offers something of a starting line, coinciding with broader trade policy changes and representing the last major discounting spree before back-to-school shopping around Labor Day, followed by early-bird holiday sales leading up to Black Friday.",
      "Since Bright Data began tracking prices of 230 items for NBC News on March 2, about 29% of them saw price hikes, with an average increase of nearly 6%. Home Depot and Target saw the most price hikes, affecting 39% and 37%, respectively, of those tracked since March. And over roughly the last month, price increases have been more common than reductions: In all but one week since May 30, twice as many products increased in price than decreased across the four major retailers.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia's rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted Monday, sending a column of volcanic materials as high as 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky and depositing ash on villages.",
      "The volcano has been at the highest alert level since last month and no casualties were immediately reported.",
      "Indonesia's Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the volcano's slopes during the eruption. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off volcanic earthquakes.",
      "The column of hot clouds that rose into the sky was the volcano's highest since the major eruption in November 2024 that killed nine people and injured dozens, said Muhammad Wafid, the Geology Agency chief. It also erupted in March.",
      "\"An eruption of that size certainly carries a higher potential for danger, including its impact on aviation,\" Wafid told The Associated Press from Switzerland where he was attending a seminar. \"We shall reevaluate to enlarge its danger zone that must be cleared of villagers and tourist activities.\"",
      "The volcano monitoring agency had increased the alert status for Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki to the highest level after an eruption on June 18, and more than doubled an exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius since then as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "After an eruption early last year, about 6,500 people evacuated and the island's Frans Seda Airport was closed. The airport has remained closed since then due to the continuing seismic activity.",
      "The 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) mountain is a twin volcano with Mount Lewotobi Perempuan in the district of Flores Timur.",
      "Monday's eruption was one of Indonesia's largest volcano eruptions since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That eruption killed 353 people and forced over 350,000 people to evacuate affected areas.",
      "Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the \"Ring of Fire,\" a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin."

      "Israel's military launched airstrikes early Monday targeting ports and facilities held by Yemen's Houthi rebels, with the rebels responding with missile fire targeting Israel.",
      "The attacks came after an attack Sunday targeting a Liberian-flagged ship in the Red Sea that caught fire and took on water, later forcing its crew to abandon the vessel.",
      "Suspicion for the attack on the Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas immediately fell on the Houthis, particularly as a security firm said bomb-carrying drone boats appeared to hit the ship after it was targeted by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. The rebels' media reported on the attack but did not claim it. It can take them hours or even days before they acknowledge an assault.",
      "A renewed Houthi campaign against shipping could again draw in U.S. and Western forces to the area, particularly after President Donald Trump targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.",
      "The ship attack comes at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most-sensitive atomic sites during an Israeli war against the Islamic Republic. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also was traveling to Washington to meet with Trump.",
      "Israeli strikes target Houthi-held ports",
      "The Israeli military said it struck Houthi-held ports at Hodeida, Ras Isa and Salif, as well as the Ras Kanatib power plant. It released footage showing an F-16 launching from Israel for the strike, which came after the Israeli military issued a warning for the area.",
      "\"These ports are used by the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons from the Iranian regime, which are employed to carry out terrorist operations against the state of Israel and its allies,\" the Israeli military said.",
      "The Israeli military also said it struck the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle-carrying vessel that the Houthis seized back in November 2023 when they began their attacks in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "\"Houthi forces installed a radar system on the ship and have been using it to track vessels in the international maritime arena to facilitate further terrorist activities,\" the Israeli military said.",
      "The Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader was affiliated with an Israeli billionaire. It said no Israelis were on board. The ship had been operated by a Japanese firm NYK Line.",
      "The Houthis acknowledged the strikes, but offered no damage assessment from the attack. Their military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, claimed its air defense forces \"effectively confronted\" the Israelis without offering evidence.",
      "Israel has repeatedly atacked Houthi areas in Yemen, including a naval strike in June. Both Israel and the United States have struck ports in the area in the past \u2014 including an American attack that killed 74 people in April \u2014 but Israel is now acting alone in attacking the rebels as they continue to fire missiles at Israel.",
      "Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened further strikes.",
      "\"What's true for Iran is true for Yemen,\" Katz said in a statement. \"Anyone who raises a hand against Israel will have it cut off. The Houthis will continue to pay a heavy price for their actions.\"",
      "The Houthis then responded with an apparent missile attack on Israel. The Israeli military said it attempted to intercept the two missiles launched by the Houthis, but they appeared to make impact, though no injuries have been reported. Sirens sounded in the West Bank and along the Dead Sea.",
      "Ship attack forces crew to abandon vessel",
      "The attack on the Magic Seas, a bulk carrier heading north to Egypt's Suez Canal, happened some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the Houthis. The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center first said that an armed security team on the vessel had returned fire against an initial attack of gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades, though the vessel later was struck by projectiles.",
      "Ambrey, a private maritime security firm, issued an alert saying a merchant ship had been \"attacked by eight skiffs while transiting northbound in the Red Sea.\"",
      "Ambrey later said the ship also had been attacked by bomb-carrying drone boats, which could be a major escalation. It said two drone boats struck the ship, while another two had been destroyed by the armed guards on board.",
      "The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said the ship was taking on water and its crew had abandoned the vessel. They were rescued by a passing ship, it added.",
      "The U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet referred questions to the military's Central Command, which said it was aware of the incident without elaborating.",
      "Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister for Yemen's exiled government opposing the Houthis, identified the vessel attacked as the Magic Seas and blamed the rebels. The ship had been broadcasting it had an armed security team on board in the vicinity the attack took place and had been heading north.",
      "\"The attack also proves once again that the Houthis are merely a front for an Iranian scheme using Yemen as a platform to undermine regional and global stability, at a time when Tehran continues to arm the militia and provide it with military technology, including missiles, aircraft, drones, and sea mines,\" al-Eryani wrote on the social platform X.",
      "The Magic Seas' owners did not respond to a request for comment."

    "story": [
      "Fatal floods in Texas that left thousands scrambling for safety with little warning have sparked a fresh round of scrutiny of Trump administration cuts to the National Weather Service.",
      "At least 81 people were dead and many others were missing Sunday evening after floodwaters surged through Texas Hill Country, an area known as \u201cflash flood alley.\u201d",
      "Within hours of the deluge early Friday, some Texas officials were critical of the NWS, saying forecasts underestimated the rainfall. Sunday, President Donald Trump rejected the idea of investigating whether NWS cuts had left key vacancies, and the White House said claims that NWS cuts had anything to do with the tragedy were \u201cdisgusting.\u201d",
      "Independent meteorologists and a former NWS official said warnings issued in the run-up to the flooding were about as timely and accurate as could be expected with the weather data available in real time. Predicting extreme rain and flash flooding beyond several hours is challenging, they said, and it is also not easy to ensure urgent warnings reach those most at risk.",
      "\u201cThe forecasting was good. The warnings were good. It\u2019s always about getting people to receive the message,\u201d said Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist based in Wisconsin. \u201cIt appears that is one of the biggest contributors \u2014 that last mile.\u201d",
      "The meteorologists said they did not think understaffed offices were a primary factor in the tragic outcome, even though the NWS has leadership gaps after a rash of staffing cuts.",
      "Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union that represents government employees, said the San Antonio weather forecasting office did not have two of its top positions filled \u2014 a permanent science officer (a role that conducts training and is in charge of implementing new technology) or a warning coordination meteorologist (who coordinates with the media and is the public face of the office), though there are employees acting in those leadership roles. Overall, Fahy said, the offices had enough meteorologists to respond to the event.",
      "\u201cThe WFOs [weather forecasting offices] had adequate staffing and resources as they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,\u201d Fahy said Saturday, but he added that he was concerned about the unfilled senior positions and vacuums of leadership.",
      "In a statement, the NWS said it was \u201cheartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County.\u201d It did not address questions about staffing but provided a detailed timeline of the warnings it sent out.",
      "Some Texas officials have suggested the National Weather Center forecast did not convey the storm\u2019s threat, while others said they were grateful for timely alerts from the agency.",
      "\u201cThe original forecast that we received on Wednesday from the National Weather Service predicted 3 to 6 inches of rain in the Concho Valley and 4 to 8 inches of rain in the Hill Country,\u201d Texas Emergency Management Chief W. Nim Kidd said at a news conference Friday. \u201cThe amount of rain that fell in this specific location was never in any of those forecasts nonetheless.\u201d",
      "The National Weather Center indicated Kerrville, Texas, and its surrounding areas could be at risk of flash flooding Thursday, according to the National Weather Service timeline. Then, NWS Austin/San Antonio issued a flood watch at 1:18 p.m. Thursday into Friday morning. It issued its urgent flash flood warnings for Kerr County at 1:14 a.m.",
      "Andy Brown, the Travis County judge, or chief executive, thanked the NWS for its alerts. Eric Carter, the county\u2019s chief emergency management coordinator, described the weather service as being \u201cvery proactive in their warnings.\u201d",
      "The agency noted that it sent out a flash flood warning with tags of \u201cconsiderable\u201d or \u201ccatastrophic\u201d at 1:14 a.m. CT Friday, which would trigger \u200b\u200bwireless emergency alerts on enabled mobile devices.",
      "\u201cFlash Flood Warnings were issued on the night of July 3 and in the early morning of July 4, giving preliminary lead times of more than three hours,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Trump administration this spring laid off NWS employees and also offered buyouts and early retirements. By early June, the weather service had lost about 600 employees. Many veteran workers left, along with employees on probation and those recently hired or promoted.",
      "Some NWS offices have experienced staffing reductions of more than 40%, and the agency has scrambled to fill critical roles at some forecasting offices. At least eight offices stopped operating 24 hours a day this spring as a result, and some have suspended weather balloon launches.",
      "In May, more than 40% of the country\u2019s weather forecasting offices had staffing vacancy rates above 20%. The cuts prompted all of the living former directors of the NWS to write a letter expressing concern over staffing levels and future budget cuts.",
      "\u201cOur worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life. We know that\u2019s a nightmare shared by those on the forecasting front lines\u2014and by the people who depend on their efforts,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Compared with many forecasting offices across the country, the Texas offices remain relatively well-staffed.",
      "Fahy said the San Antonio/Austin weather forecasting office is operating with 11 staff meteorologists and is down six employees from its typical full staffing level of 26. He also said the nearby San Angelo office, which issued warnings for parts of central Texas, is short four staff members from its usual staffing level of 23. The meteorologist-in-charge position \u2014 the office\u2019s top leadership position \u2014 is not permanently filled. The office is also without a senior hydrologist.",
      "\u201cIn San Angelo, there is no hydrologist, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Fahy said. Hydrologists analyze stream flow and play a key role in flood response.",
      "Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said the city will look at whether its own emergency notifications were robust enough to warn residents.",
      "\u201cWe know questions are being asked about the emergency notification, and while it is not the time to speculate, local and regional partners are committed to a full review of the events and systems in place,\u201d Rice said at a news conference Sunday. \u201cAt the appropriate time, we will take clear steps to strengthen our future preparedness. We owe that commitment to the families who are suffering and every member of our community.\u201d",
      "Prominent independent meteorologists who have been critical of NWS staffing and budget cuts in the past have said federal meteorologists on the ground issued timely warnings.",
      "Alan Gerard, the former director of the analysis and understanding branch at the National Severe Storms Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in a blog post that the Austin/San Antonio forecasting office did a good job communicating the risks as quickly as possible, despite the unfilled leadership positions.",
      "\u201cObviously, having both of these positions vacant for a prolonged time is not optimal, and certainly could have had negative impacts at some level,\u201d Gerard wrote. \u201cHowever, just looking at the actual warning services that NWS provided during the event, they were solid and provided the level of warning and alerts that the public should expect to receive for an event such as this.\u201d",
      "Matt Lanza, a Houston-based meteorologist, said there were no initial indications that staffing levels or budget cuts played a role in the tragedy.",
      "Vagasky, the Wisconsin meteorologist, said predicting flash flooding and extreme rain is notoriously difficult.",
      "\u201cQuantitative precipitation forecasting, called QPF, is one of the hardest things meteorologists have to do. You have to get the right location, the right amount, the right timing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were aware this was a significant event, and they were messaging that.\u201d",
      "Vagasky said the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry moved into Texas and fed tropical moisture to severe thunderstorms, which stalled out over central Texas and pummeled the region with extreme precipitation.",
      "He added that the cadence by which forecasters indicated increasing concern fit with what weather models were showing and what he would expect.",
      "The Texas Hill Country is often called \u201cflash flood alley\u201d because its topography can funnel and quickly swell rivers. Knowing precisely where the rain will fall is key for hydrologic models to understand where flood impacts would be worse.",
      "\u201cThe forecasts this week were for 4 to 7, 5 to 9 inches of rain, somewhere in there. And some models were showing higher amounts on top of that. Knowing is that higher amount going to fall 3 miles this way or 3 miles that way has a big impact on what the ultimate results are,\u201d Vagasky said. \u201cUnfortunately, the science just isn\u2019t at that point where you can say, \u2018OK, I know at this specific latitude and longitude, we\u2019re going to get this much rain.\u2019\u201d",
      "The overnight timing of the heaviest rain and the floodwaters\u2019 beginning to rise is a nightmare scenario for forecasters, Vagasky said.",
      "\u201cSevere weather response in the middle of the night is one of the biggest challenges. That\u2019s when we see the most tornado fatalities and the most flooding fatalities. People are asleep. They can\u2019t see the tornado or the water rising,\u201d he said. \u201cDid people have their emergency alerts turned on on their phones?\u201d",
      "Vagasky, who has criticized staffing reductions and cuts to weather balloon releases at the NWS, said he did not think better staffing would have prevented the tragedy.",
      "\u201cThose are important positions that do need to be filled,\u201d he said, but he added that it \u201cprobably wasn\u2019t a significant contributor to what happened.\u201d",
      "Vagasky said there is plenty of room to improve quantitative precipitation forecasting that could help forecasters identify threats earlier. Such research is at risk if the administration cuts NOAA\u2019s funding as it has outlined, he said.",
      "\u201cThe big concern is the latest budget request. If it goes through Congress the way the administration wants, it shuts down all the NOAA research labs, which are the labs doing the work to improve that forecasting.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HUNT, Texas \u2014 Like others who were in homes or vacationing over the July 4 weekend at Texas\u2019 Guadalupe River, Christian Fell, 25, was jolted awake by the crack of thunder.",
      "It was about 3 a.m., just a couple hours since Fell had gone to sleep alone in his grandmother\u2019s home on the river in Hunt, Texas. The rest of his family was staying upriver at another house. Then came more noise \u2014 this time sounding like a break-in \u2014 and he got out of bed.",
      "Follow along for live updates",
      "\u201cI get up and I swing my feet over the side of the bed and I can feel water,\u201d Fell said.",
      "The river water that he\u2019d normally watch from the patio of the historic stone home his grandfather built was now over his ankles \u2014 and rising fast.",
      "He would soon learn it was dragging trees and debris that slammed against the house, tore up the patio, nearly trapped him inside and ultimately forced him to swim through a window and cling to a meter box to survive.",
      "In what one local said is a region considered the jewel of Texas, where the river is known more as a place of play and relaxation, communities are reeling from deadly flooding that has claimed the lives of dozens of people, including 15 children.",
      "There had been flash flood warnings, but residents said those are not unusual in the area, which, like much of the state, had also been in a yearslong drought.",
      "So Fell, like many others, went to sleep, some wary of the storm but expecting to wake to barbecues, the smell of a wet trees and the familiar river they fished, waded and plunged into for years.",
      "Instead, for Fell, the early-morning hours of July 4 became a fight for survival.",
      "With the water rising fast, he walked from the bedroom to the living room, using the flashlight on his phone. He turned to see water pouring into the wrecked patio. He tried the kitchen door, hoping to reach his truck.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave through the kitchen door because as soon as I opened it, all this water started flooding in and it was about waist-high at this point, probably about five minutes after I woke up,\u201d said Fell, who is 6 feet tall.",
      "He returned to the bedroom and tried to climb onto the air mattress he had been sleeping on, but couldn\u2019t. A door on another side of the house wouldn\u2019t open. He tried calling 911 but was disconnected three times, he said. On one call, he said the dispatcher told him to call back when the water was at chin level.",
      "\u201cI had to go underwater and swim through the broken window,\u201d he said.",
      "Once outside, he tried to climb to the roof, but the gutter he grabbed on to snapped off. Fell instead clung to a meter box mounted on the house, the top of which is about 7 feet above the ground. He stood on its narrow top for several hours, his hands dangerously close to electrical wires, until the water receded.",
      "A tree, a shed, a telephone pole and a porch",
      "Matt Meagher, 39, and Erin Burgess, were at home in the Bumble Bee subdivision, across the street from the river. The home, which Burgess bought five years ago, is one of the closest to the river, the site of peaceful morning walks, until July 4.",
      "They were also awakened by thunder. With their dog, Stella, they stepped outside to watch the rain, which was heavy, but not alarming. They returned to bed and checked Facebook for weather warnings, but didn\u2019t find any.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden I looked at him and said, \u2018What is that sound?\u2019 and he said, \u2018It sounds like it\u2019s raining in the house.\u2019 We looked down and water was coming through the walls,\u201d Burgess said.",
      "That was about 4:30 a.m. By 5:15 a.m., Burgess and her 19-year-old son were clinging to a large tree in their front yard, holding on for an hour. The water had risen so high, Burgess tiptoed to keep her head above it. They had tried to get onto the roof but were swept toward the tree instead.",
      "Meagher grabbed Stella and was fighting the river\u2019s current while bracing against a shed that was on the back of his pickup truck.",
      "But the truck started to move and Meagher was nearly pinned up against it.",
      "\u201cSo I let go and then I went to that telephone down there,\u201d he said, pointing to a pole several feet up the road. He\u2019d barely let go before water slammed an SUV into the same pole. His stepson had yelled that the vehicle was headed his way.",
      "\u201cA car started rolling towards me, so I let go again and I was about to get crushed twice,\u201d he said.",
      "The current carried him up the block and shoved him up against the wooden porch railing of a neighbor who was looking through a window with his flashlight. The neighbor pulled him and Stella \u2014 still in his arms \u2014 inside to safety.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was ever going to see him again,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cHe was whistling and I was yelling and then I no longer heard him whistling.\u201d",
      "Burgess said she clung to a tree as she prayed for her neighborhood, and for the water to \u201cgo down and stop rushing.\u201d",
      "Meagher and Burgess said nearly everything in their home was destroyed. They estimate the water reached 8 feet. Mud and sewage from the septic tank also filled the 2004 Infiniti M37 \u2014 a car that Meagher, who builds hot rods, had customized with a $7,000 engine and $5,000 rims.",
      "They had grabbed keys and flashlights \u2014 and little else \u2014 before the water broke through their door.",
      "They didn\u2019t know what, if anything, could be salvaged. But they reunited at a neighbor\u2019s home later that day with one unexpected survivor.",
      "\u201cWhen the water receded \u2026 we came back in and found our cat [Kiki],\u201d Burgess said. \u201cOur cat was floating on my bed, alive.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the U.S. will revert to steep country-by-country tariff rates at the beginning of August, weeks after the tariff rate pause is set to expire.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don\u2019t move things along, then on Aug. 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,\u201d Bessent said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to see a lot of deals very quickly.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump had originally set a 90-day deadline \u2014 set to expire Wednesday \u2014 for countries to renegotiate the eye-watering tariff levels he laid out in his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d speech. He paused those rates a week later, while setting a new 90-day deadline to renegotiate them.",
      "That deadline was set to expire Wednesday.",
      "CNN host Dana Bash responded to Bessent on Sunday, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s basically a new deadline,\u201d prompting Bessent to push back.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a new deadline. We are saying this is when it\u2019s happening,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cIf you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that\u2019s your choice.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Trump, too, referred to an Aug. 1 deadline, raising questions about whether the July 9 deadline still stands. A White House spokesperson did not provide a comment when asked to clarify whether the April 2 tariff rates would resume July 9 or Aug. 1.",
      "The president has recently given shifting descriptions of how firm the July 9 deadline is, saying at the end of June, \u201cWe can extend it, we can shorten it,\u201d only to double down on it several days later, saying he was not thinking about extending it.",
      "Shortly after midnight Friday, Trump referred to an Aug. 1 timeline, telling reporters that the April 2 tariff rates would resume at the start of August.",
      "Asked whether the U.S. would be flexible with any countries about on the July 9 deadline, Trump said, \u201cNot really.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll start to pay on Aug. 1,\u201d he added. \u201cThe money will start to come into the United States on Aug. 1, OK, in pretty much all cases.\u201d",
      "Trump said Friday that the administration would start sending letters to countries, adding, \u201cI think by the 9th they\u2019ll be fully covered.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll range in value from maybe 60% or 70% tariffs to 10% and 20% tariffs, but they\u2019re going to be starting to go out sometime tomorrow,\u201d Trump said overnight on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the final form, and it\u2019s basically going to explain what the countries are going to be paying in tariffs.\u201d",
      "Trump said in a Truth Social post late Sunday evening that tariff letters would be delivered starting at noon on Monday.",
      "Bessent also said Sunday that \u201cmany of these countries never even contacted us.\u201d",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers \u2014 which can pass on part or all of the costs to consumers \u2014 and not necessarily by entities in the goods\u2019 country of origin.",
      "The White House had initially projected confidence that dozens of countries would try to make deals. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in April that \u201cwe\u2019ve got 90 deals in 90 days possibly pending here.\u201d Late last month, Trump said, \u201cEverybody wants to make a deal,\u201d and after he announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, he said countries were \u201ccalling us up, kissing my a--.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are,\u201d he said in April. \u201cThey are dying to make a deal. \u2018Please, please, sir, make a deal. I\u2019ll do anything.\u2019\u201d",
      "The renewed uncertainty is likely to further upset markets, where stock futures went lower Friday after Trump mentioned the country letters. Stocks have returned to all-time highs in part due to the lull in tariff news.",
      "So far, Trump has imposed higher import duties on autos and auto parts, steel and aluminum, and goods from China and Vietnam."

    "story": [
      "In a race between Joey Chestnut and Usain Bolt, who could eat a hot dog then run a 100-meter dash faster?",
      "Professional athletes and hot dog-eating contest fans alike are divided as the new hypothetical scenario goes viral on social media.",
      "In a TikTok video posted by the official account for the PGA Tour, professional golfers were asked whether the nationally recognized competitive eater would beat the eight-time Olympic gold medalist sprinter in the proposed race.",
      "Without hesitation, Max Homa responded to the hypothetical, \u201cOh, Joey Chestnut, I think.\u201d",
      "Later in the clip, he explained that he believes Chestnut could likely run 100 meters in less than 20 seconds, adding, \u201cI\u2019m hard pressed that I could eat a hot dog in 20 seconds. Yeah, I\u2019m going Joey Chestnut.\u201d",
      "At first, Jordan Spieth locked in Bolt before asking how quickly Chestnut can eat a hot dog. (In this year's Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, Chestnut was once again crowned winner, consuming 70.5 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes.)",
      "After questioning some of the logistics of the race \u2014 like whether the hot dog would be consumed at the starting line, which could lead to a head start for Chestnut, Spieth decided on the sprinter.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going with who can run faster because I think a hot dog can get wolfed down pretty quick,\u201d he said, before posing an alternative. \u201cNow, if you said, \u201810 hot dogs and then run,\u2019 when does it even out?\u201d",
      "\u201cJoey Chestnut would smoke him at 10 (hot dogs before running),\u201d Spieth added. \u201cI think even two might be close.\u201d",
      "Saheeth Theegala reasoned that \u201ceven if Joey runs a 15-second 100-meter,\u201d the golfer still felt Chestnut would win.",
      "\u201cI think Usain, even if he eats (the hot dog) as fast as he could and swallows it, I don\u2019t see him eating it in under 8, 10 seconds,\u201d he said, adding his final consensus is that Bolt finishing an entire hot dog will take longer than Chestnut\u2019s ability to run 100 meters.",
      "Amid much internal debate and in-depth analysis, the pro golfers landed fairly divided over who would win the competition \u2014 ever so slightly favoring Chestnut. And the comment section under the TikTok video equally entertained the proposition.",
      "\u201cJoey is taking this without a doubt,\u201d one user wrote.",
      "\u201cDo you people have any idea the amount of calories that Usain Bolt has to eat to maintain his performance level? He could put down a single hot (dog) pretty ... quick I imagine,\u201d another argued.",
      "While some found it wild to compare the Olympic medalist widely regarded as \u201cthe fastest man in history\u201d to the 17-time champion of Nathan\u2019s July Fourth competitive eating contest, some still theorized Chestnut would take home the gold this time around.",
      "Other comments simply marveled at the \u201cphenomenal question\u201d itself, with one user writing, \u201cthat\u2019s the greatest hypothetical ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhoever came up with this question deserves a raise,\u201d another wrote.",

    "summary": "How do you vote during Love Island USA? Here is a guide to the voting process and what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to the \"Love Island USA\" villa, where drama runs deeper than the pool that few people are seen swimming in and your vote holds more power than a perfectly timed text message.",
      "While the Islanders navigate dramatic re-couplings and spicy challenges, you \u2014 the devoted viewer at home \u2014 get to play puppet master in this sun-soaked theater of romance.",
      "From deciding which couples deserve a second chance to sending your least favorite Islander packing their suitcase, your vote can shift the entire trajectory of the villa.",
      "The \"Love Island USA\" voting system puts viewers in the driver's seat of the villa's most pivotal moments.",
      "Whether you\u2019re pro chaos or rooting for genuine connections, your participation can directly shape which Islanders get to stay in paradise and which ones are catching the next flight home.",
      "The power dynamics shift constantly in the villa, but one thing remains consistent: The audience holds the ultimate authority over who wins that $100,000 prize.",
      "How to Cast Your Vote",
      "Ready to play villa matchmaker? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about making your voice heard.",

      "Once you\u2019ve downloaded the app, you\u2019ll need to set up a profile. The process is quick and straightforward.",

      "Voting typically opens at the end of an episode, usually around 10 p.m. ET, though the exact timing can vary depending on the episode\u2019s runtime and any extended drama that needs to unfold on screen.",
      "Here's the catch that keeps things exciting: You don't have all night to deliberate. Voting windows are intentionally brief, typically staying open for about two hours before closing.

There's no wrong way to participate \u2014drama and genuine connections both make for compelling television.",
      "Your Vote Matters",
      "In a villa where a single conversation can change everything, never underestimate the impact of your participation. Islanders have been saved by narrow margins, and fan favorites have been unexpectedly eliminated.",
      "So download that app, set those notifications, and get ready to help write the next chapter of \u201cLove Island USA\u201c Season 7. After all, the best love stories are the ones we all help create together \u2014even if that means occasionally stirring the pot for the sake of good television.",
      "The villa awaits your verdict."

      "The internet personality uploaded a get-ready-with-me video to TikTok July 2 in which she opened up about her decision to change her \u201cnatural teeth.\u201d At the start of the clip, Earle used an emery board to file her teeth. She explained that she bit off part of her tooth while eating dinner the night before and she wanted to see if could smooth the chipped enamel and make it look \u201cmore nonchalant.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared for this,\u201d she said as she started to use the nail file. But afterwards, she was satisfied with her appearance and smiled at the camera.",
      "Then, the podcaster began to apply her makeup while launching into a story about the adjustments she has made to her teeth over the years.",
      "\u201cWell, I guess, veneer reveal. It was after I graduated college, I think, like in August, I did it. I never wanted to post about it because I immediately feel like I regretted it, and I never want to influence people to do something that I don\u2019t think they should do,\u201d she shared.",
      "Earle added, \u201cAlthough, I like the results. I think that it was great.\u201d",
      "She explained that as a child she had \u201creally good straight teeth\u201d except for two of her front teeth. She recalled falling off her bike during her childhood and hitting the front of her mouth.",
      "Although two of her teeth were dislodged and \u201cdangling from the nerves,\u201d her dentist advised her to hold them in place until they eventually straightened.",
      "Her teeth returned to their original position, but she decided to try Invisalign \u2014 custom clear aligners \u2014 during her final year of high school. Again, she was pleased with the results, but they didn\u2019t last because didn\u2019t wear her retainers, causing her teeth to shift. So, prior to graduation she underwent a cosmetic procedure called composite bonding. The reversible cosmetic procedure involves applying \u201ctooth-colored resin material to the affected teeth to change their shape, size or color,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "When the material cracked due to her biting her teeth, she finally opted to get veneers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an anxious person. So sometimes, if I have, like, a bad dream, I\u2019ll bite my teeth and they would crack off. It happened a lot, honestly, probably like twice a year they cracked off. Senior year of college (I) started getting a following on here, made some money,\u201d she explained. \u201cBecause I had friends that had veneers on just these two (front) teeth, I was like, \u2018Oh, you know what? That seems like a good idea.\u2019\u201d",
      "She spoke to a dentist who claimed it wouldn\u2019t be possible to only fix two of her teeth. According to her, the dentist said it would not be worth it to get the cosmetic procedure because all her teeth would not look the same.",
      "\u201cSo I went in for two teeth, and I basically left with 10,\u201d she continued as she became emotional. \u201cIt was one of those things that I did it and\u2026I regretted it right away. I think it was really scary for me I was like, \u2018What did I just do?\u2019\u201d",
      "Earle emphasized how much she wishes she had waited before changing her appearance.",
      "\u201cI will say I don\u2019t regret a lot. It is something I really regret doing. At the end of the day, whatever, it was my decision. But I feel like it was kind of one of those decisions that was made pretty fast and I just didn\u2019t think it all the way through, or, I think, talk to enough people.\u201d",
      "Despite some moments of insecurity since then, she has grown to like her smile.",
      "\u201cI actually like the character in my teeth. It\u2019s great,\u201d she said.",
      "Toward the end of the video, she apologized to any fans who might be upset that she didn\u2019t share this information sooner.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about doing anything to your teeth, this is your sign to not do it and to embrace your natural teeth,\u201d she concluded. \u201cDon\u2019t follow my lead on this one.\u201d"

      "CBS has announced a few twists that \u201cBig Brother\u201d fans can expect to see when the show returns for Season 27, including one that even surprised host Julie Chen Moonves.",
      "On July 2, ahead of the long-running summer competition show\u2019s premiere on Thursday, July 10, CBS shared first-look images of the newly designed \u201cBig Brother\u201d house and revealed the theme for the season: \u201cA Summer of Mystery.\u201d",
      "In a press release, the network teased that the houseguests will soon move into \u201cHotel Myst\u00e8re, a place where secrets lurk behind every door and nothing is as it seems.\u201d",
      "What does that mean? Well, CBS explained that the season premiere will include \u201cunexpected twists and turns including a masked visitor, a secret accomplice and the shocking arrival of a \u2018Mystery Houseguest\u2019 whose identity will remain under wraps \u2026 at least for now.\u201d",
      "The 90-minute premiere kicks off at 8 p.m. ET/PT and will be followed by another extended episode on Sunday, July 13, at the same time.",

      "In an Entertainment Weekly interview published July 3, the host said the mystery houseguest will be a \u201cpolarizing\u201d figure who viewers will surely have an opinion about.",
      "\u201cWhat I can say is the mystery houseguest, when I was told who this person is, I had to expect the unexpected! I never expected that person,\u201d Chen Moonves shared. \u201cAnd I was very excited because, in my opinion, getting that person is epic. And that person is also very polarizing. So there\u2019s going to be a strong reaction in both directions for this mystery houseguest.\u201d",
      "As for the secret accomplice, Moonves revealed that the person will be required to complete certain tasks.",
      "She said, \u201cThe accomplice this person\u2019s going to have \u2014 they\u2019re going to have responsibilities, and they may or may not be able to pull it off, and that will affect the game.\u201d",
      "The host described the masked visitor as a more \u201cdisruptive\u201d version of the AI Bot A.I.N.S.L.E.Y. who took over last season.",
      "\u201cAinsley could do only so much, but this masked visitor is going to wreak havoc in ways that we\u2019ve never seen before. And I would say on a deeper level. Much deeper. It\u2019s more three dimensional,\u201d she teased.",
      "Speaking of Season 26, Moonves suggested that the AI Arena, which allowed three nominees to compete for another chance at safety on eviction night, could return this year.",
      "\u201cYeah, I was a huge fan of it, as was everyone internally. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but last summer it worked so well, so we extended it. Because it wasn\u2019t supposed to go on for as long as it did,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason I liked it so much is because at the beginning of each season, there tends to be this herd mentality where there\u2019s no surprise on eviction night because the whole house goes one way.\u201d",
      "Moonves added, \u201cSo things that work well tend to make an appearance again. I mean, look at the Power of Veto. That became a staple after Season 3. So I would say it\u2019s like shaking the Magic 8 Ball \u2014 signs are pointing to yes.\u201d",
      "She also said the mystery theme will affect the houseguests and viewers at home. For instance, the host explained that some items in the house might appear ordinary but will play a role in how the game unfolds this season.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a detective this year to play this game,\u201d she advised the Season 27 houseguests.",
      "Following the format of previous seasons, \u201cBig Brother\u201d is expected to reveal its Season 27 cast a few days before the premiere."

    "story": [
      "AJ McLean has fond memories of working with Liam Payne on \u201cBuilding the Band,\u201d as well as bonding with the late singer over music and their shared experiences.",
      "The two singers are part of the upcoming Netflix singing competition, premiering July 9. Backstreet Boy member McLean hosts the show, while the former One Direction singer appears as a judge.",
      "Payne died at the age of 31 after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Oct. 16, 2024. His unexpected death shocked fans and people around the world.",
      "\u201cBuilding the Band\u201d marks Payne\u2019s final television appearance \u2014 and one that McLean says shows his compassion, kindness and talent.",
      "\u201cHe lit up any room that he walked into, whether it was the makeup room, dressing room, on set. Wherever he was, he lit up that space with his energy, with his open heart, open mind,\u201d McLean tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cBuilding the Band\u201d centers around singers, isolated in their own pods, who have to create their own group without ever seeing one another, just hearing the others' voices.",
      "Once the groups form, Payne, along with judge Kelly Rowland and judge and mentor Nicole Scherzinger, give feedback to the singers during performances.",
      "McLean remembers Payne as a mentor to rising talent.",
      "\u201cHe was just so well spoken, very supportive, rigorously honest, in a compassionate way,\u201d McLean adds. \u201cHe always spoke from the heart.\u201d",
      "McLean recalls spending time with Payne in between takes, describing him as \u201cthe coolest dude.\u201d He also says that Payne shared unreleased music with him and asked his opinion.",
      "\u201cI had known him prior to the show, but not as close as we got. Obviously, we\u2019re with each other 12 to 14 hour days for about five weeks, you do learn a lot about someone,\u201d McLean says, noting that Payne was \u201cvery inviting and very forthcoming.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was just an absolute sweetheart, witty, funny. He sent me an unreleased body of work to get my opinion on it \u2014 and I never put that out there,\u201d he continues. \u201cI thought that was really sweet that he would entrust someone that he\u2019s still learning about to give their opinion.\u201d",
      "After One Direction went on an indefinite hiatus in 2016, Payne embarked on a solo career. He released an EP, \u201cFirst Time,\u201d in 2018 and his debut album, \u201cLP1,\u201d the following year. His final song, \u201cTeardrops,\u201d dropped in March 2024.",
      "Of the new music Payne was working on, McLean says, \u201cI thought it was a great body of work.\"",
      "\u201cAnd I hope that the world and that the fans get to hear it somewhere down the road. It\u2019s beautiful, beautiful music,\u201d he says.",
      "Aside from being in best-selling and popular boy bands, McLean touches on their shared life experiences and openness about their past addiction struggles.",
      "\u201cHonestly, we had a lot of parallel life experiences, (despite) our age gap,\u201d McLean says. \u201cBut we definitely, I feel, lived very parallel lives, both sober and not sober.\u201d",
      "Prior to his death, Payne said that he had been in rehab for 100 days in 2023. In 2019, during an interview with Men\u2019s Health Australia he shared that he used alcohol to cope with the fame of being part of One Direction.",
      "Over the years, the Backstreet Boy has been candid about his substance abuse, sobriety and staying clean. In a 2020 interview with People, he recalled hitting rock bottom when he was with his then 3-year-old daughter Lyric.",
      "McLean is grateful for the time he was able to spend with Payne, adding, \u201cHe was just an absolute dream.\u201d",
      "The first four episodes of \u201cBuilding the Band\u201d will be released July 9 on Netflix. New episodes drop Wednesdays, with the final batch on July 23."

      "Israel's military launched airstrikes early Monday targeting ports and facilities held by Yemen's Houthi rebels, with the rebels responding with missile fire targeting Israel.",
      "The attacks came after an attack Sunday targeting a Liberian-flagged ship in the Red Sea that caught fire and took on water, later forcing its crew to abandon the vessel.",
      "Suspicion for the attack on the Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas immediately fell on the Houthis, particularly as a security firm said bomb-carrying drone boats appeared to hit the ship after it was targeted by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. The rebels' media reported on the attack but did not claim it. It can take them hours or even days before they acknowledge an assault.",
      "A renewed Houthi campaign against shipping could again draw in U.S. and Western forces to the area, particularly after President Donald Trump targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.",
      "The ship attack comes at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most-sensitive atomic sites during an Israeli war against the Islamic Republic. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also was traveling to Washington to meet with Trump.",
      "Israeli strikes target Houthi-held ports",
      "The Israeli military said it struck Houthi-held ports at Hodeida, Ras Isa and Salif, as well as the Ras Kanatib power plant. It released footage showing an F-16 launching from Israel for the strike, which came after the Israeli military issued a warning for the area.",
      "\"These ports are used by the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons from the Iranian regime, which are employed to carry out terrorist operations against the state of Israel and its allies,\" the Israeli military said.",
      "The Israeli military also said it struck the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle-carrying vessel that the Houthis seized back in November 2023 when they began their attacks in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "\"Houthi forces installed a radar system on the ship and have been using it to track vessels in the international maritime arena to facilitate further terrorist activities,\" the Israeli military said.",
      "The Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader was affiliated with an Israeli billionaire. It said no Israelis were on board. The ship had been operated by a Japanese firm NYK Line.",
      "The Houthis acknowledged the strikes, but offered no damage assessment from the attack. Their military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, claimed its air defense forces \"effectively confronted\" the Israelis without offering evidence.",
      "Israel has repeatedly atacked Houthi areas in Yemen, including a naval strike in June. Both Israel and the United States have struck ports in the area in the past \u2014 including an American attack that killed 74 people in April \u2014 but Israel is now acting alone in attacking the rebels as they continue to fire missiles at Israel.",
      "Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened further strikes.",
      "\"What's true for Iran is true for Yemen,\" Katz said in a statement. \"Anyone who raises a hand against Israel will have it cut off. The Houthis will continue to pay a heavy price for their actions.\"",
      "The Houthis then responded with an apparent missile attack on Israel. The Israeli military said it attempted to intercept the two missiles launched by the Houthis, but they appeared to make impact, though no injuries have been reported. Sirens sounded in the West Bank and along the Dead Sea.",
      "Ship attack forces crew to abandon vessel",
      "The attack on the Magic Seas, a bulk carrier heading north to Egypt's Suez Canal, happened some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the Houthis. The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center first said that an armed security team on the vessel had returned fire against an initial attack of gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades, though the vessel later was struck by projectiles.",
      "Ambrey, a private maritime security firm, issued an alert saying a merchant ship had been \"attacked by eight skiffs while transiting northbound in the Red Sea.\"",
      "Ambrey later said the ship also had been attacked by bomb-carrying drone boats, which could be a major escalation. It said two drone boats struck the ship, while another two had been destroyed by the armed guards on board.",
      "The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said the ship was taking on water and its crew had abandoned the vessel. They were rescued by a passing ship, it added.",
      "The U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet referred questions to the military's Central Command, which said it was aware of the incident without elaborating.",
      "Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister for Yemen's exiled government opposing the Houthis, identified the vessel attacked as the Magic Seas and blamed the rebels. The ship had been broadcasting it had an armed security team on board in the vicinity the attack took place and had been heading north.",
      "\"The attack also proves once again that the Houthis are merely a front for an Iranian scheme using Yemen as a platform to undermine regional and global stability, at a time when Tehran continues to arm the militia and provide it with military technology, including missiles, aircraft, drones, and sea mines,\" al-Eryani wrote on the social platform X.",
      "The Magic Seas' owners did not respond to a request for comment."

      "Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s attacks in Gaza have killed more than 56,000 people and created a humanitarian crisis in the densely populated Palestinian territory, where most of the 2 million residents have been forced from their homes."

      "BEERSHEBA, Israel \u2014 American contractors guarding aid distribution sites in Gaza are using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food, according to accounts and videos obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Two U.S. contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were revealing their employers\u2019 internal operations, said they were coming forward because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous and irresponsible practices. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open license to do whatever they wished.",
      "They said their colleagues regularly lobbed stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians. One contractor said bullets were fired in all directions \u2014 in the air, into the ground and at times toward the Palestinians, recalling at least one instance where he thought someone had been hit.",
      "\u201cThere are innocent people being hurt. Badly. Needlessly,\u201d the contractor said.",
      "He said American staff on the sites monitor those coming to seek food and document anyone considered \u201csuspicious.\u201d He said they share such information with the Israeli military.",
      "Videos provided by one of the contractors and taken at the sites show hundreds of Palestinians crowded between metal gates, jostling for aid amid the sound of bullets, stun grenades and the sting of pepper spray.",
      "Other videos include conversation between English-speaking men discussing how to disperse crowds and encouraging each other after bursts of gunfire. NBC News has not obtained or reviewed the videos.",
      "The testimonies from the contractors \u2014 combined with the videos, internal reports and text messages obtained by the AP \u2014 offer a rare glimpse inside the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the newly created, secretive American organization backed by Israel to feed the Gaza Strip\u2019s population. Last month, the U.S. government pledged $30 million for the group to continue operations \u2014 the first known U.S. donation to the group, whose other funding sources remain opaque.",
      "In a statement issued in response to the AP\u2019s report, GHF said they had launched an investigation, which included reviewing the videos, and concluded that the claims in the story are \u201ccategorically false,\u201d and questioned the credibility of the reporting. The organization added that they are pursuing legal action against the news outlet.",
      "Journalists have been unable to access the GHF sites, located in Israeli military-controlled zones. The AP and NBC News cannot independently verify the contractors\u2019 stories.",
      "On Wednesday, officials in Switzerland initiated proceedings to dissolve the Geneva branch of the GHF, citing legal shortcomings in its establishment, Reuters reported.",
      "The group is registered in the U.S. state of Delaware and had registered an affiliate in Geneva on Feb. 12. The Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (ESA), a Swiss regulatory body, told Reuters the GHF had not fulfilled certain legal requirements including having the correct number of board members, a postal address or a Swiss bank account.",
      "\u201cGHF confirmed to the ESA that it had never carried out activities in Switzerland ... and that it intends to dissolve the Geneva-registered (branch),\u201d the ESA said in a statement obtained by Reuters.",
      "A spokesperson for Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF, told the AP that there have been no serious injuries at any of their sites to date. In scattered incidents, security professionals fired live rounds into the ground and away from civilians to get their attention. That happened in the early days at the \u201cthe height of desperation where crowd control measures were necessary for the safety and security of civilians,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million Palestinians are living through a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the 21-month war, Israel has bombarded and laid siege to the strip, leaving many teetering on the edge of famine, according to food security experts.",
      "For 2 1/2 months before GHF\u2019s opening in May, Israel blocked all food, water and medicine from entering Gaza, claiming Hamas was stealing the aid being transported under a preexisting system coordinated by the United Nations. It now wants GHF to replace that U.N. system. The U.N. says its Gaza aid operations do not involve armed guards.",
      "Over 57,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the war erupted, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants.",
      "GHF is an American organization, registered in Delaware and established in February to distribute humanitarian aid during the ongoing Gaza humanitarian crisis. Since the GHF sites began operating more than a month ago, Palestinians say Israeli troops open fire almost every day toward crowds on roads heading to the distribution points, through Israeli military zones. Several hundred people have been killed and hundreds more wounded, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and witnesses.",
      "In response, Israel\u2019s military says it fires only warning shots and is investigating reports of civilian harm. It denies deliberately shooting at any innocent civilians and says it\u2019s examining how to reduce \u201cfriction with the population\u201d in the areas surrounding the distribution centers.",
      "AP\u2019s reporting for this article focuses on what is happening at the sites themselves. Palestinians arriving at the sites say they are caught between Israeli and American fire, said the contractor who shared videos with the AP.",
      "\u201cWe have come here to get food for our families. We have nothing,\u201d he recounted Palestinians telling him. \u201cWhy does the [Israeli] army shoot at us? Why do you shoot at us?\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the GHF said there are people with a \u201cvested interest\u201d in seeing it fail and are willing to do or say almost anything to make that happen. The spokesperson said the team is composed of seasoned humanitarian, logistics and security professionals with deep experience on the ground. The group says it has distributed the equivalent of more than 50 million meals in Gaza in its food boxes of staples.",
      "GHF says that it has consistently shown compassionate engagement with the people of Gaza.",
      "Throughout the war, aid distribution has been marred by chaos. Gangs have looted trucks of aid traveling to distribution centers and mobs of desperate people have also offloaded trucks before they\u2019ve reached their destination. Earlier this month, at least 51 Palestinians were killed and more than 200 wounded while waiting for the U.N. and commercial trucks to enter the territory, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and a local hospital. Israel\u2019s military acknowledged several casualties as soldiers opened fire on the approaching crowd and said authorities would investigate.",
      "AP spoke to the two contractors for UG Solutions, an American outfit subcontracted to hire security personnel for the distribution sites. They said bullets, stun grenades and pepper spray were used at nearly every distribution, even if there was no threat.",
      "Videos of aid being dispensed at the sites seen by the AP appear to back up the frenetic scenes the contractors described. The footage was taken within the first two weeks of its distributions \u2014 about halfway into the operations.",
      "In one video, what appear to be heavily armed American security contractors at one of the sites in Gaza discuss how to disperse Palestinians nearby. One is heard saying he has arranged for a \u201cshow of force\u201d by Israeli tanks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want this to be too aggressive,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause this is calming down.\u201d",
      "At that moment, bursts of gunfire erupt close by, at least 15 shots. \u201cWhoo! Whoo!\u201d one contractor yelps.",
      "\u201cI think you hit one,\u201d one says.",
      "Then comes a shout: \u201cHell, yeah, boy!\u201d",
      "The camera\u2019s view is obscured by a large dirt mound.",
      "The contractor who took the video told AP that he saw other contractors shooting in the direction of Palestinians who had just collected their food and were departing. The men shot both from a tower above the site and from atop the mound, he said. The shooting began because contractors wanted to disperse the crowd, he said, but it was unclear why they continued shooting as people were walking away.",
      "The camera does not show who was shooting or what was being shot at. But the contractor who filmed it said he watched another contractor fire at the Palestinians and then saw a man about 60 yards (meters) away \u2014 in the same direction where the bullets were fired \u2014 drop to the ground.",
      "This happened at the same time the men were heard talking \u2014 effectively egging each other on, he said. In other videos furnished by the contractor, men in grey uniforms \u2014 colleagues, he said \u2014 can be seen trying to clear Palestinians who are squeezed into a narrow, fenced-in passage leading to one of the centers. The men fire pepper spray and throw stun grenades that detonate amid the crowd. The sound of gunfire can be heard. The contractor who took the video said the security personnel usually fire at the ground near the crowds or from nearby towers over their heads.",
      "During a single distribution in June, contractors used 37 stun grenades, 27 rubber-and-smoke \u201cscat shell\u201d projectiles and 60 cans of pepper spray, according to internal text communications shared with the AP.",
      "That count does not include live ammunition, the contractor who provided the videos said.",
      "One photo shared by that contractor shows a woman lying in a donkey cart after he said she was hit in the head with part of a stun grenade.",
      "An internal report by Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF to run the sites, found that aid seekers were injured during 31% of the distributions that took place in a two-week period in June. The report did not specify the number of injuries or the cause. SRS told the AP the report refers to non-serious injuries.",
      "More videos show frenzied scenes of Palestinians running to collect leftover food boxes at one site. Hundreds of young men crowd near low metal barriers, transferring food from boxes to bags while contractors on the other side of the barriers tell them to stay back.",
      "Some Palestinians wince and cough from pepper spray. \u201cYou tasting that pepper spray? Yuck,\u201d one man close to the camera can be heard saying in English.",
      "SRS acknowledged that it\u2019s dealing with large, hungry populations, but said the environment is secure, controlled, and ensures people can get the aid they need safely."

    "story": [
      "The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that the ancient Tibetan Buddhist institution he leads will live on after he dies, putting an end to speculation that he would be the last person to hold the role as he plans to reincarnate.",
      "As part of celebrations marking his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also signaled that China, which Tibetan activists accuse of suppressing their language, culture and religion, should stay out of the process of choosing his successor.",
      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after he fled Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",
      "Anxiety is mounting over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, in which he is worshiped as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion. His succession plan is likely to have an impact on Tibetans opposed to China\u2019s tight control of the Himalayan autonomous region.",
      "The Chinese government responded to the comments swiftly, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry saying the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval from the central government, spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "The Dalai Lama made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Titbetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that the Chinese government could take advantage of a gap in leadership.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he was temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",
      "In 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.",
      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years, the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, he said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then, he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books, including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they do not select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, six years after the previous one died. The boy was forcibly \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the 6 million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",
      "If Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, \u201cTibetans would not be surprised,\u201d Jinpa said. \u201cThey would be disappointed and annoyed, but I don\u2019t think they would be surprised.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government says that Tibet has prospered under its rule and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says that the Dalai Lama is \u201ca political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion\u201d and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.",
      "China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations\u201d that Beijing claims aim to protect the tradition and religious freedom.",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval by the central government, Mao, the ministry spokesperson, said Wednesday."

    "story": [
      "LIUYANG, China \u2014 There are few sights more dazzling than fireworks on the Fourth of July. Yet all the sparkle and sound on the most American day of the year relies almost solely on China, which is mired in a trade war with the United States that could disrupt fireworks displays across the country from big cities to backyard barbecues.",
      "The U.S. imported more than 120,000 tons of fireworks in 2023, with over 97% of them \u2014 including those displayed at Independence Day celebrations \u2014 coming from China, according to the World Bank. American fireworks wholesalers and distributors are warning that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports could limit supply and send prices soaring unless the duties are brought down.",
      "Though most Chinese-made fireworks were shipped in time for this year\u2019s Fourth of July celebrations, uncertainty hangs over future holidays as well as the \u201cgrand celebration\u201d Trump has promised for the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.",
      "U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, which had reached as high as 145%, are currently at 30% after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce that ends in mid-August. The tariff rate for fireworks was previously 5%.",
      "The uncertainty is felt strongly here in Liuyang, a production hub in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that on its own makes nearly 60% of the world\u2019s fireworks. The city of about 1.5 million people is proudly known as the birthplace of fireworks, with a history in the business dating to China\u2019s Tang Dynasty more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Wendy Tang, owner of Pyroshine Fireworks in Liuyang, said factories went through a \u201creally hard time\u201d when U.S.-China trade tensions escalated in March and April, a peak shipping season for July Fourth fireworks. At times, the U.S. and China were increasing their tariff rates multiple times a day.",
      "\u201cIn the morning, it\u2019s 100%. But in the afternoon, it\u2019s like 200%,\u201d Tang said, making it \u201cvery hard\u201d for her American customers to decide whether to proceed with their orders.",
      "Her U.S. clients eventually chose to go ahead, Tang said, and her company cleared almost all of its stock.",
      "\u201cMy customers said: \u2018OK. No matter what, we need fireworks for the consumers during the Independence Day,\u2019\u201d said Tang, who said she is now trying to confirm as many orders as possible for next year\u2019s July Fourth.",
      "While most U.S. warehouses were already stocked with fireworks for this year, shows in some places may be scaled back or cost more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at $20,000 or more increased cost just to get the container out of port,\u201d Matthew Lavigne, the owner of Green Mountain Fireworks in Alburgh, Vermont, told NBC affiliate WPTZ.",
      "In a letter to Trump sent in April, the American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association said the tariffs could \u201ccripple\u201d the $2 billion fireworks industry in the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs will not incentivize U.S. production \u2014 they will only increase costs,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Though fireworks received a tariff exemption during Trump\u2019s first term, there is no word on whether there will be any such reprieve this time around.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: \u201cReal prosperity and patriotism isn\u2019t celebrating the independence of our country with cheap foreign-made firecrackers and trinkets \u2014 it\u2019s having a country with booming Main Streets, a thriving working class, and robust manufacturing.\u201d",
      "The fireworks industry says it would be impossible for the U.S. to replicate Chinese manufacturing, citing its lack of key raw materials, its high labor costs and the extensive land it requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no country on the planet that can have this infrastructure and can do mass production that they can do here,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Souza Linares, international business manager at the Indiana-based North Central Industries, the largest supplier of fireworks in the U.S. Midwest, said in an interview in Liuyang.",
      "At Tang\u2019s factory, there are dozens of workshops scattered across the slopes, serving different purposes in the production process.",
      "Some steps are automated, such as cutting paper and rolling it into shells or stacking tubes to form casings, but others, such as loading powder into the tubes, have to be done by hand because the work is so delicate and risky.",
      "An explosion at a Hunan fireworks factory this month killed nine people and injured 26 others, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "To prevent such accidents, work areas are separated by walls and kept at a distance from each other, with high-risk stages monitored by surveillance cameras overseen by local authorities. The government has strict rules limiting the amount of explosive powder each person can handle and the number of workers allowed in each area at any given time.",
      "Workers wear color-coded uniforms from yellow to orange \u2014 orange being the most dangerous \u2014 to indicate the level of danger linked with their tasks. Those working with the most dangerous materials are required to stop by around noon, before the hottest time of day.",
      "The American fireworks industry, which is made up mostly of small businesses, relies heavily on factories such as Tang\u2019s to supply events big and small.",
      "But Pyroshine Fireworks has received \u201cvery few orders\u201d recently as U.S. distributors \u201cwait and see what\u2019s going to happen with the tariffs,\u201d said Melissa Cai, the company\u2019s U.S. sales manager.",
      "If the U.S. and China can\u2019t reach a trade agreement, there will be a \u201cbig disruption\u201d in the fireworks market, Souza said.",
      "\u201cWe are really nervous because nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.",

The grant will rise to around $170 million next year and remain stable for 2026-2027.",
      "The increase of more than 53% came as the monarchy reported record offshore wind farm profits to the Crown Estate, which is a vast royal collection of land and property across the United Kingdom. This will be used primarily to fund the ongoing refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, according to a Sovereign Grant report released Tuesday.",
      "Funded by the taxpayer, the Sovereign Grant is used to support the official duties of the monarch and other costs such as official travel, thousands of engagements, staff for working royals and the maintenance of occupied palaces.",
      "It is based on a proportion of profits from the Crown Estate, an independently managed portfolio of assets, including luxury properties in central London, historical estates, rural land and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland worth around 15 billion pounds ($20.6 billion).",
      "The assets are hereditary possessions held \u201cin right of the Crown,\u201d the profits of which are added to Britain\u2019s Treasury. The grant is reviewed every five years, and is expected to next be reviewed through legislation in 2026-27 to keep funding for the royal family at an \u201cappropriate\u201d level.",
      "Control of the estate was surrendered in 1760 by King George III in exchange for a percentage of the profits.",

      "\u201cDrug addiction led me to a critical condition. I couldn\u2019t find a way out, and I was scared,\u201d he told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "A year ago, he managed to escape from a panic house (also known as panicueva, or panic cave) commonly used by organized crime gangs in Mexico. Some of these buildings, located in Guanajuato and other states where drug use is rampant, also serve as recruitment bases for young people selected to become hit men and operatives for these criminal groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the place where you can go, buy your drugs, and get high right there,\u201d said another 19-year-old who managed to escape a panic house and was interviewed by Noticias Telemundo on the condition that he remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.",
      "\"I entered a panic house and saw several women who had to prostitute themselves, and several of my friends got involved in selling drugs and ended up being killed,\u201d said the young man. He said he spent five years living in one of the houses and eventually joined a local gang.",
      "According to the latest report issued by the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the highest number of homicides (980 from January to April). In February, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.",
      "\"They've put a gun to my head, they\u2019ve threatened me, they\u2019ve told me I\u2019m done, that\u2019s it. But the most horrible thing I\u2019ve seen is how they killed my best friend,\u201d the young man said, referring to his experience in the shelters.",
      "\u201cI was required to do many things ... they send us to train to use a firearm, all of that comes together and from there come the hit men, from there come the thieves, the hawks,\u201d he said, referring to the murderers, thieves and drug traffickers.",
      "'They are recruiting more minors'",
      "Guanajuato is grappling with gang clashes over criminal activities such as fuel trafficking, and is also the epicenter of a growing methamphetamine epidemic. According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health, the addiction rate to this drug in the state grew 449% over the past 20 years.",

      "\u201cLe\u00f3n is the number one city in terms of drug dealing,\u201d said Juan Mauro Gonz\u00e1lez, Guanajuato\u2019s secretary of security.",
      "\"Drug houses\" aren\u2019t unique to Mexico; similar trends exist in other countries, such as drug houses in the United States or drug dens in Spain. \u201cWhile criminals may be attracted to abandoned houses, these are also spaces where potential victims and criminals tend to converge without surveillance. Our results support the idea that abandoned houses also generate crime,\u201d said Lauren C. Porter, a professor at the University of Maryland who co-wrote a study on the issue.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia's rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted Monday, sending a column of volcanic materials as high as 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky and depositing ash on villages.",
      "The volcano has been at the highest alert level since last month and no casualties were immediately reported.",
      "Indonesia's Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the volcano's slopes during the eruption. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off volcanic earthquakes.",
      "The column of hot clouds that rose into the sky was the volcano's highest since the major eruption in November 2024 that killed nine people and injured dozens, said Muhammad Wafid, the Geology Agency chief. It also erupted in March.",
      "\"An eruption of that size certainly carries a higher potential for danger, including its impact on aviation,\" Wafid told The Associated Press from Switzerland where he was attending a seminar. \"We shall reevaluate to enlarge its danger zone that must be cleared of villagers and tourist activities.\"",
      "The volcano monitoring agency had increased the alert status for Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki to the highest level after an eruption on June 18, and more than doubled an exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius since then as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "After an eruption early last year, about 6,500 people evacuated and the island's Frans Seda Airport was closed. The airport has remained closed since then due to the continuing seismic activity.",
      "The 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) mountain is a twin volcano with Mount Lewotobi Perempuan in the district of Flores Timur.",
      "Monday's eruption was one of Indonesia's largest volcano eruptions since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That eruption killed 353 people and forced over 350,000 people to evacuate affected areas.",
      "Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the \"Ring of Fire,\" a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin."

      "Khamenei\u2019s absence during the war suggested the Iranian leader, who has final say on all state matters, had been in seclusion in a bunker \u2014 something not acknowledged by state media. State TV in Iran showed him waving and nodding to the chanting crowd, which rose to its feet as he entered and sat at a mosque next to his office and residence in the capital, Tehran.",
      "There was no immediate report on any public statement made. Iranian officials such as the parliament speaker were present. Such events are always held under heavy security.",
      "After the U.S. inserted itself into the war by bombing three key nuclear sites in Iran, U.S. President Donald Trump sent warnings via social media to the 86-year-old Khamenei that the U.S. knew where he was but had no plans to kill him, \u201cat least for now.\u201d",

      "Iran has acknowledged the deaths of more than 900 people in the war, as well as thousands of injured. It also has confirmed serious damage to its nuclear facilities, and has denied access to them for inspectors with the U.N. nuclear watchdog.",
      "Iran\u2019s president on Wednesday ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, further limiting inspectors\u2019 ability to track a program that had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels. Israel launched the war fearing that Iran was trying to develop atomic weapons.",
      "It remains unclear just how badly damaged the nuclear facilities are, whether any enriched uranium or centrifuges had been moved before the attacks, and whether Tehran still would be willing to continue negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program.",
      "Israel also targeted defense systems, high-ranking military officials and atomic scientists. In retaliation, Iran fired more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of them intercepted, killing 28 people and causing damage in many areas.",
      "Ceremony commemorates a death that caused rift in Islam",
      "The ceremony that Khamenei hosted Saturday was a remembrance of the 7th century martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson, Hussein.",
      "Shiites represent over 10% of the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims, and they view Hussein as the rightful successor to the Prophet Muhammad. Hussein\u2019s death in battle at the hands of Sunnis at Karbala, south of Baghdad, created a rift in Islam and continues to play a key role in shaping Shiite identity.",
      "In predominantly Shiite Iran, red flags represented Hussein\u2019s blood and black funeral tents and clothes represented mourning. Processions of chest-beating and self-flagellating men demonstrated fervor. Some sprayed water over the mourners in the intense heat.",
      "Reports of problems accessing the internet",
      "NetBlocks, a global internet monitor, reported late Saturday on X that there was a \u201cmajor disruption to internet connectivity\u201d in Iran. It said the disruption corroborated widespread user reports of problems accessing the internet. The development comes just weeks after authorities shut down telecoms during the war. NetBlocks later said internet access had been restored after some two hours."

      "He later clarified that the statement was made in his personal capacity as China warned New Delhi against interfering in its domestic affairs at the expense of bilateral relations.",
      "On Sunday, Rijiju said the Dalai Lama was India\u2019s \u201cmost honored guest. ... We feel blessed for his presence here in our country.\u201d",
