      "MIAMI -- For their latest project, the Florida Panthers signed Wayne Gretzky, Martina Navratilova, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Dustin Johnson and the Miami Heat.",
      "And they were armed with paintbrushes, not hockey sticks.",
      "The Panthers \u2014 a few hours before their Winter Classic outdoor game at the Miami Marlins' ballpark against the New York Rangers \u2014 unveiled a couple dozen panther sculptures, all painted in a unique way and now being auctioned off with hopes of raising $1 million for cancer research.",
      "Gretzky commissioned a sculpture that displays some of his stats, Johnson arranged one depicting a scene from Augusta National, Bubl\u00e9's is adorned in rhinestone braille, the NBA's Heat commissioned a pair of sculptures with some of the team's themes, artist Romero Britto painted one as well and Navratilova didn't technically paint hers \u2014 she dipped tennis balls into paint and then served them into the panther, creating a polka-dotted splash of various colors.",

      "About $700,000 has been raised already, Zito said.

Zito and his wife Julie co-chair the Panthers' project; she is a breast cancer survivor, and Zito has lost a number of relatives to the disease.",
      "\u201cIt was my wife Julie's idea,\u201d Zito said. \u201cAnd we lived in Chicago during \u2018Cows on Parade,\u2019 and then Romero Britto said we should auction them. I can't take credit for any of it.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "Latinos and the Spanish-speaking community in the U.S. have grown increasingly wary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.",
      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way.

      "The 1960s French sex symbol, actor, singer and animal welfare activist Brigitte Bardot has died",
      "NEW YORK -- In addition to being a 1960s French sex symbol, actor, singer and animal welfare activist, Brigitte Bardot was a muse to many \u2014 in particular, musicians.",
      "Her name, with its alliterative cadence, became synonymous with a kind of classic beauty. In songs, Bardot is often not Bardot the woman, but a symbol for desire \u2014 shorthand for a bombshell. Decades removed from the peak of her screen fame, contemporary performers continue to sing her name despite her many controversies, including being convicted five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred and provocative comments about the #MeToo movement.",
      "It may not be her main legacy, but Bardot, who died Sunday in southern France, will live in on the songs that mention her. Across genre and language, here is a sampling.",
      "The last track of the canonical \u201cThe Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan\u201d exhibits Dylan's wicked verbosity and elastic folk. \u201cWell, my telephone rang it would not stop / It\u2019s President Kennedy callin\u2019 me up / He said, My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow? I said my friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,\u201d he sings. \u201cAnita Ekberg / Sophia Loren / Country\u2019ll grow.\u201d",
      "The Brazilian artist Caetano Veloso composed the protest song at the beginning of the tropicalismo movement; it became a hallmark of his career and one of the best-known Brazilian songs of all time. In it, he sings, \u201cEm caras de presidentes / Em grandes beijos de amor / Em dentes, pernas, bandeiras / Bomba e Brigitte Bardot\u201d (\u201cIn faces of presidents / In big kisses of love / In teeth, legs, flags / Bombs and Brigitte Bardot\u201d).",
      "A central architect of French pop, singer Serge Gainsbourg wrote this duet for himself and Bardot. It's styled after a poem the outlaw Bonnie Parker wrote, titled \u201cThe Trail\u2019s End,\u201d shortly before she and partner Clyde Barrow were killed.",
      "Jaunty piano and Elton John's ascendent vocal melodies, all for a song with a less-than-optimistic title. John sings the words from his longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin: \u201cI\u2019d make an exception / If you want to save my life / Brigitte Bardot gotta come / And see me every night.\u201d",
      "The Pretenders know a little something about the social power of Bardot. The English rock band's principal songwriter and frontperson Chrissie Hynde sings: \u201cWhen love walks in the room / Everybody stand up / Oh, it\u2019s good, good, good / Like Brigitte Bardot.\u201d",

      "French 1960s sex symbol Brigitte Bardot has died at age 91",
      "PARIS -- Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals. Speaking to The Associated Press, he gave no cause of death, and said that no arrangements had been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month.",
      "Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie \u201cAnd God Created Woman.\u201d Directed by then husband Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.",
      "At the height of a cinema career that spanned more than two dozen films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolize a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France\u2019s best-known stars, even as she struggled with depression.",
      "Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \u201cMarianne,\u201d the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal. Bardot\u2019s face appeared on statues, postage stamps and coins.",
      "\u2018\u2019We are mourning a legend,'' French President Emmanuel Macron said in an X post.",
      "Bardot\u2019s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She traveled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals. She also condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.",
      "\u201cMan is an insatiable predator,\u201d Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\u201d",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots\u2019 respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest recognition.",
      "Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.",
      "She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays.",
      "Bardot\u2019s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d\u2019Ormale, a onetime adviser to far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist with multiple racism convictions of his own, as a \u201clovely, intelligent man.\u201d",
      "In 2012, she supported the presidential bid of Marine Le Pen, who now leads her father's renamed National Rally party. Le Pen paid homage Sunday to an \u201cexceptional woman\u201d who was \u201cincredibly French.\u201d",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \u201chypocritical,\u201d because many played \u201cthe teases\u201d with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \u201ccharming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass.\u201d",
      "Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born Sept. 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.",
      "Bardot once described her childhood as \u201cdifficult\u201d and said that her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.",
      "Vadim, a French movie produce who she married in 1952, saw her potential and wrote \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.",
      "The film, which portrayed Bardot as a teen who marries to escape an orphanage and then beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\u201d Bardot said of her early films. \u201cI suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\u201d",

      "Bardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant media attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas. Photographers had broken into her house two weeks before she gave birth to snap a picture of her pregnant.",
      "Nicolas\u2019 father was Jacques Charrier, a French actor who she married in 1959 but who never felt comfortable in his role as Monsieur Bardot. Bardot soon gave up her son to his father, and later said she had been chronically depressed and unready for the duties of being a mother.",
      "\u201cI was looking for roots then,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI had none to offer.\u201d",
      "In her 1996 autobiography \u201cInitiales B.B.,\u201d she likened her pregnancy to \u201ca tumor growing inside me,\u201d and described Charrier as \u201ctemperamental and abusive.\u201d",

      "Among her films were \u201cA Parisian\u201d (1957); \u201cIn Case of Misfortune,\u201d in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; \u201cThe Truth\u201d (1960); \u201cPrivate Life\u201d (1962); \u201cA Ravishing Idiot\u201d (1964); \u201cShalako\u201d (1968); \u201cWomen\u201d (1969); \u201cThe Bear And The Doll\u201d (1970); \u201cRum Boulevard\u201d (1971); and \u201cDon Juan\u201d (1973).",
      "With the exception of 1963\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cContempt,\u201d directed by Godard, Bardot\u2019s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.",
      "\u201cIt was never a great passion of mine,\u201d she said of filmmaking. \u201cAnd it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn (Monroe) perished because of it.\u201d",

      "She emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking. She abandoned her jet-set life and sold off movie memorabilia and jewelry to create a foundation devoted exclusively to the prevention of animal cruelty.",
      "Depression sometimes dogged her, and she said that she attempted suicide again on her 49th birthday.",
      "Her activism knew no borders. She urged South Korea to ban the sale of dog meat and once wrote to U.S. President Bill Clinton asking why the U.S. Navy recaptured two dolphins it had released into the wild.",
      "She attacked centuries-old French and Italian sporting traditions including the Palio, a free-for-all horse race, and campaigned on behalf of wolves, rabbits, kittens and turtle doves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... my distress takes over,\u201d Bardot told the AP when asked about her racial hatred convictions and opposition to Muslim ritual slaughter,",
      "In 1997, several towns removed Bardot-inspired statues of Marianne after the actress voiced anti-immigrant sentiment. Also that year, she received death threats after calling for a ban on the sale of horse meat.",
      "Environmental campaigner Paul Watson, who was beaten on a seal hunt protest in Canada alongside Bardot in 1977 and campaigned with her for five decades, acknowledged that \u201cmany disagreed with Brigitte\u2019s politics or some of her views.\u201d",

      "Hollywood has wrapped up a turbulent 2025 with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and \u201cMarty Supreme.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood wrapped up a turbulent year with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a box-office hit for Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet with \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d over a busy holiday weekend in movie theaters.",
      "As expected, James Cameron\u2019s latest trip to Pandora dominated ticket sales, collecting $88 million over the four-day Christmas-to-Sunday period and $64 million on the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Though \u201cFire and Ash\u201d initially opened notably softer domestically than its 2022 predecessor, \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water,\u201d it held better in its second weekend. It dipped just 28%, whereas \u201cWay of Water\u201d fell 53%.",
      "In two weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has quickly amassed $217.7 million in North America for The Walt Disney Company. But the $400 million-budgeted film has been a massive draw internationally, grossing $542.7 million thus far overseas. To reach the box-office heights of the previous films, both of which rank among the biggest blockbusters ever, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will need to sustain business through New Year\u2019s and early January. If it does, \u201cAvatar\u201d could become the first franchise with three $2 billion movies.",
      "But much of the heat in theaters over Christmas and on the weekend belonged to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d A24\u2019s biggest budget release, Josh Safdie\u2019s 1950s-set table tennis drama collected $27.1 million over the four-day weekend, a smash success for the indie studio.",
      "Chalamet went to great lengths to promote the acclaimed release, including appearing atop the Sphere in Las Vegas. The strong opening proved that the 30-year-old star has drawing power beyond most of his contemporaries, and it marked a rare box-office win for a wholly original film. Safdie\u2019s film carries a price tag of about $70 million.",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d even bested the film most analysts expected to rank number two: Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cAnaconda.\u201d The big-screen comedy, starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, collected $23.7 million over the four-day holiday weekend. That\u2019s still good for comedy, a genre most studios have abandoned in recent years. But \u201cAnaconda\u201d (50% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) was surely dinged by poor reviews.",
      "Hollywood is ending the year with its best Christmas Day box office since before the COVID-19 pandemic, a celebratory final note in what\u2019s been a rough year for the film industry. Going into the year, expectations were high for the industry\u2019s first year this decade not marred by pandemic or strike.",
      "\u201cIt was a really solid end to a tumultuous year,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt's been a roller-coaster ride. I think the best news for the industry \u2014 I know we kind of say this every year \u2014 but if you look at the lineup for 2026, it's pretty incredible.\u201d",
      "But domestic ticket sales on the year are ending roughly on par with the disappointing $8.75 billion in 2024. With three days left in 2025, the box-office total is $8.76 billion, according to Comscore. By comparison, in 2019, that total was $11.4 billion.",
      "That\u2019s a worrying development for theaters, which are now nervously watching Netflix attempt to buy one of Hollywood\u2019s most storied studios in Warner Bros. The highest grossing film of the year was a Chinese production, the $2 billion-generating \u201cNe Zha 2.\u201d The most-watched movie of 2025 was \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d a movie Sony Pictures sold to Netflix. Even the Oscars are headed to YouTube.",
      "What worked in 2025? PG-rated movies. For the second year in a row, PG-rated movies outperformed PG-13 ones. Domestically, PG films generated $2.87 billion, according to Comscore, while PG-13 movies collected $2.78 billion.",
      "The three biggest Hollywood blockbusters were all PG-rated: \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($1.42 billion globally), \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion) and \"A Minecraft Movie\u201d ($958.2 million).",
      "\u201cZootopia 2\u201d even outranked the newcomers over the traditional weekend. In its fifth weekend, it earned another $20 million. Propelled by \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d Disney became the first studio since 2019 to cross $6 billion worldwide in the year.",
      "Yet expectations are already growing for a rebound year at the box office in 2026. Among the major titles upcoming are \u201cThe Super Mario Galaxy Movie,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Brand New Day,\u201d the live-action \u201cMoana,\u201d \u201cToy Story 5\u201d and \u201cThe Mandalorian and Grogu.\u201d",
      "The coming week, when schools are out and many people are off work, should be one of the busiest weeks of the year in theaters. Aside from the top films, a number of other releases will hope to capitalize.",
      "That includes Lionsgate's \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the Paul Feig thriller starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried ($46.7 million in two weeks); \u201cDavid,\u201d the animated David and Goliath film from Angel Studios ($49.8 million in two weeks); Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants\u201d ($38.2 million in two weeks); and Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue.\u201d",

      "But while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.",
      "Officials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
      "\u201cThis fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.",
      "Under the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state\u2019s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state\u2019s population.",
      "The formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.",
      "Several Republican-led states \u2014 including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.",
      "The money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to \u201cclaw back\u201d funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.",
      "\u201cI've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.",
      "Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she\u2019s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that\u2019s struggling,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cThis money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.\u201d",
      "But experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.",
      "Estimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP\u2019s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.",
      "\u201cWhen you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know \u2014 that math does not add up,\u201d Cochran-McClain said.",
      "She also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state\u2019s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.",

Experts say that keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",

      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area\u2019s population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\u201d Otto said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources, what the scientists call \u201climits of adaptation.\u201d The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",

      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex.

      "People probably don\u2019t know how much sugar they\u2019re eating",
      "Many consumers feel pride in avoiding the glazed pastries in the supermarket and instead opting for \u201call natural\u201d granola that comes packed with extra protein. Same goes for low-fat yogurts \u201cmade with real fruit,\u201d organic plant-based milks and bottled \u201csuperfood\u201d smoothies.",
      "Buyer beware: Healthy grocery buzzwords like those often cover up an unhealthy amount of sugar.",
      "Added sugars are difficult to quickly spot because many companies use clever marketing to distract consumers, said Nicole Avena, a professor of neuroscience and psychiatry at Mount Sinai Medical School and Princeton University who has studied added sugars.",
      "Avena said while some health-forward brands know people are starting to become aware of the hazards of added sugars, \"a lot of the bigger brands don\u2019t worry so much about people\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s how to spot hidden sugars and what to do about it.",
      "Along with saturated fat and salt, eating excess sugar is linked to heart disease, obesity, diabetes and other health risks.",
      "The average American consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, which adds up to 57 pounds (26 kilograms) per year, according to the American Heart Association. About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.",
      "To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.",
      "Companies reduced common sweeteners like refined beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup but added alternatives, such as monk fruit and the sugar alcohol erythritol, which aren\u2019t considered \u201cadded sugars\u201d under FDA regulations.",
      "\u201cNow our foods are even more sweet than they were back in 2020,\u201d Avena said.",
      "Collin Popp, a dietitian and professor at NYU Langone Health, said the current FDA recommendation allows for some flexibility. People should get no more than 10% of their calories from added sugar, which amounts to about 50 grams per day if eating 2,000 calories, or a bit more than what\u2019s in a typical can of soda.",
      "But that might be too flexible, Popp said.",
      "\u201cI would actually like to see that be less than 5%, and closer to zero for some, if they have diabetes or prediabetes,\u201d he said.",

      "One Chobani black cherry yogurt, for example, has zero grams of fat but 9 grams of added sugar, or more than 2 teaspoons. Silk brand almond milk has 7 grams per cup.",
      "Popp recommends taking control of how much sugar goes into your food. That could mean buying plain yogurt and adding honey or berries, or asking the barista if you can put your own oat milk into your coffee.",
      "Although they lower the calorie content of foods, artificial sweeteners like stevia and sugar alcohols may not be better because they can encourage people to overeat, Avena said. She said research shows that sweet flavors are what activate the reward center of the brain, not the sugar itself.",
      "That\u2019s not to write off sugar alternatives, including allulose for people with Type 1 diabetes since it doesn\u2019t affect blood sugar.",
      "But for the general public, minimizing dependence on the overall sweetness of food is key to improving health, she said.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let the food companies decide how much sugar you\u2019re eating,\" Avena said.",

      "The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum where the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather are on display",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first known visit to a sacred family mausoleum, a step that experts say bolstered her status as her father's potential heir.",
      "The visit, which occurred on New Year\u2019s Day on Thursday, even sparked speculation that the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 13, could be named a high-level official at the upcoming ruling Workers\u2019 Party congress.",
      "Images carried by North Korea\u2019s state media on Friday showed Kim Ju Ae standing in the front row with her parents and deeply bowing at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, where the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather are on display.",
      "The palace is \u201ca place that symbolizes legitimacy of the North Korean regime\u201d and her visit there ahead of the Workers' Party congress is a politically orchestrated move, said Cheong Seong-Chang, deputy head of the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.",
      "Kim Jong Un, 41, is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea since the country's foundation in 1948. He often marks key state anniversaries by visiting the Kumsusan palace and paying respect to his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung.",
      "Cheong predicted that Kim Jong Un could give his daughter the first secretary post at the Workers' Party, the party's No. 2 job, at the congress. Other experts say she is too young to accept such a high-profile post and might be provided with lower-level jobs.",

North Korea hasn't said when it will hold it, but the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, said it likely will be held either in January or February.",
      "Since first appearing in state media in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has accompanied her father at a slew of events including military parades and missile launches. In September, Kim Jong Un brought her on his trip to Beijing. During New Years' Day celebrations this week, she kissed her father on the cheek, showing their closeness. I'm",
      "In January 2024, the NIS said it viewed Kim Ju Ae as her father's likely heir. Some outside experts disagree with that assessment, citing Kim Jong Un\u2019s relatively young age and the extremely male-dominated nature of North Korea\u2019s power hierarchy. The NIS told lawmakers in November that Kim appeared to have no major health problems.",
      "Revealing the young Kim Ju Ae was a surprise to foreign experts because neither Kim Jong Un nor Kim Jong Il were mentioned in North Korean state media before they became adults. Some observers say Kim Jong Un likely aimed to shore up public support for his plan to extend the family's rule by repeatedly disclosing Kim Ju Ae in public events.",

That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don\u2019t always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market are also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",
      "Economists generally forecast that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will remain slightly above 6% next year.",

But the historic milestone arrives amid political instability and skepticism among ordinary people fueled by fears of price rises.",
      "Supporters of switching to the euro from the old currency, the lev, are praising the move as one of the greatest achievements since the 1989 transition from a Soviet-style economy to democracy and free markets. They hope it will make the country more attractive for investors and strengthen its orientation toward wealthier Western Europe.",
      "But many people are uneasy, in a country where corruption is rife and trust in the authorities is low. One fear is that merchants will round prices up or otherwise use the changeover to worsen inflation, at a time when inflation has rebounded to 3.7%.",
      "An EU Eurobarometer poll from March showed that 53% of 1,017 people surveyed opposed joining the eurozone, while 45% were in favor. A separate Eurobarometer poll, taken between Oct. 9 and Nov. 3 on a similar sample, showed that about half of Bulgarians opposed the single currency while 42% were in favor. The margin of error was about plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the March poll.",
      "The government successfully completed the euro adoption process by beating inflation down to 2.7% earlier this year to comply with EU rules and win approval from EU leaders. But clearing that hurdle was followed by a new chapter of political chaos. The government resigned after less than a year in office amid nationwide anti-corruption protests. This left the country without a regular budget for next year and is hampering plans for long-overdue structural reforms and decisions on use of EU support funds. A new election \u2014 the eighth in five years \u2014 is expected to be held next spring.",
      "Nevelin Petrov, 64, said he welcomed the euro. \u201cBulgaria is a full member of the European Union, and its rightful place is alongside the other developed and democratic European nations,\u201d he said. \u201cI am convinced that the adoption of the euro will contribute to the long-term prosperity of our country,\u201d he said.",

      "Bulgaria, with its 6.4 million people, is one of the poorest members of the 27-country European union. The average monthly wage is 1,300 euros ($1,530).",
      "Countries that join the EU commit to the euro, but actually joining can take years and some members are in no hurry. Poland in particular has seen strong economic growth since joining the EU in 2004 without adopting the euro.",
      "Opponents of joining have fed fears that the changes will allegedly lead to more poverty and loss of national identity. Social media has spread disinformation such as false claims that the euro could lead to confiscation of bank accounts. Nationalist and pro-Russian groups exploit these fears.",
      "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has said that countries have experienced a slight, transient rise in prices of 0.2%-0.4% right after joining. Price rises can be more apparent than real, as cafe and hairdressers may put off printing new menus and price lists ahead of the change, so that increases are only delayed, not caused by the euro.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Donald Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one\u2019s efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don\u2019t get their health insurance from an employer and don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cIt really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\u201d said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly disappointed that there hasn\u2019t been more action.\u201d",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It\u2019s a strain for the 49-year-old but one he\u2019s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",

      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she\u2019ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her four-year-old daughter. She can\u2019t afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week with layoffs remaining low despite a weakening labor market.",
      "U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000 from the previous week\u2019s 215,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet forecast 208,000 new applications.",
      "Unemployment benefit filings are often distorted during holiday-shortened weeks. The shorter week can cause some who have lost jobs to delay filing claims.",

      "Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021.",
      "The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s purge of U.S. government payrolls.",

Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March.",

      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears.

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Farmers are now learning how much aid they can expect to receive from a $12 billion package that President Donald Trump announced earlier this month.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop. The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next year's crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.",
      "Soybean farmers have been hit especially hard by Trump's trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump's massive budget bill take effect later this year.",
      "Soybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.",
      "But farmers say the aid won't solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.",
      "Kentucky soybean farmer Caleb Ragland, who was president of the American Soybean Association until recently, said the aid is \u201ca Band-Aid on a deep wound. We need competition and opportunities in the market to make our future brighter.\u201d",

      "After Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. Officials have said China is on track to meet the 12 million metric ton goal by the end of February, but so far China has only purchased about 4.3 million metric tons of soybeans, according to the latest USDA figures.",

      "The aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. During the first Trump administration, a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.",
      "The USDA said it would use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. The USDA says the average size of the 1.88 million farms nationwide was 466 acres last year, but many farmers are much larger than that as larger operations have continued to buy up neighboring farms over time.",

      "By most measures, 2025 was a rough year for those who care about freedom of the press",
      "NEW YORK -- By nearly any measure, 2025 has been a rough year for anyone concerned about freedom of the press.",
      "It's likely to be the deadliest year on record for journalists and media workers. The number of assaults on reporters in the U.S. nearly equals the last three years combined. The president of the United States berates many who ask him questions, calling one woman \u201cpiggy.\u201d And the ranks of those doing the job continues to thin.",
      "It's hard to think of a darker time for journalists. So say many, including Tim Richardson, a former Washington Post reporter and now program director for journalism and disinformation at PEN America. \u201cIt's safe to say this assault on the press over the past year has probably been the most aggressive that we've seen in modern times.\u201d",
      "Worldwide, the 126 media industry people killed in 2025 by early December matched the number of deaths in all of 2024, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and last year was a record-setter. Israel's bombing of Gaza accounted for 85 of those deaths, 82 of them Palestinians.",
      "\u201cIt's extremely concerning,\u201d said Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists. \u201cUnfortunately, it's not just, of course, about the sheer numbers of journalists and media workers killed, it's also about the failure to obtain justice or get accountability for those killings.",
      "\u201cWhat we know from decades of doing this work is that impunity breeds impunity,\u201d she said. \u201cSo a failure to tackle journalists' killings creates an environment where those killings continue.\u201d",
      "The committee estimates there are at least 323 journalists imprisoned worldwide.",
      "None of those killed this year were from the United States. But the work on American soil has still been dangerous. There have been 170 reports of assaults on journalists in the United States this year, 160 of them at the hands of law enforcement, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. Many of those reports came from coverage of immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "It's impossible to look past the influence of President Donald Trump, who frequently seethes with anger at the press while simultaneously interacting with journalists more than any president in memory \u2014 frequently answering their cellphone calls.",
      "\u201cTrump has always attacked the press,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut during the second term, he's turned that into government action to restrict and punish and intimidate journalists.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press learned that quickly, when Trump limited the outlet's access to cover him after it refused to follow his lead to rename the Gulf of Mexico. It launched a court fight that has remained unresolved. Trump has also extracted settlements from ABC and CBS News in lawsuits over stories that displeased him, and is suing The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.",
      "Long angry about a perceived bias against conservatives on PBS and NPR newscasts, Trump and his allies in Congress successfully cut funding for public broadcasting as a whole. The president has also moved to shut down government-run organizations that beam news to all parts of the world.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is a major investor in media development, in independent media outlets in countries that have little or no independent media, or as a source of information for people in countries where there is no free media,\u201d Ginsberg said. \u201cThe evisceration of Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America is another blow to press freedom globally.\u201d",
      "Others in his administration take Trump's lead, like when his press office chose the day after Thanksgiving to launch a web portal to complain about outlets or journalists being unfair.",

      "Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has portrayed journalists as dark figures skulking around Pentagon halls to uncover classified secrets as his rationale for putting in restrictive rules for coverage.",
      "That's led to the most notable example of journalists fighting back: most mainstream news outlets gave up their credentials to work in the Pentagon rather than agree to these rules, and are still breaking stories while working off-site. The New York Times has sued to overturn the rules. The newspaper also publicly defends itself when attacked by the president, such as when he complained about its coverage of his health.",
      "Despite the more organized effort against the press, the public has taken little notice. The Pew Research Center said that 36% of Americans reported earlier this year hearing about the Trump administration's relationship with the press, compared to 72% who said that at the same point in his first term.",
      "Polls consistently show that journalists have never been popular, and are likely to elicit little sympathy when their work becomes harder.",
      "\u201cReally, the harm falls on the public with so much of this because the public depends on this independent reporting to understand and scrutinize the decisions that are being made by the most powerful office in the world,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "The news industry as a whole is more than two decades in to a retrenchment caused largely by a collapse in the advertising market, and every year brings more reports of journalists laid off as a result. One of the year's most sobering statistics came in a report by the organizations Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News: in 2002, there were 40 journalists for every 100,000 people in the United States and by this year, it was down to just over eight.",
      "Asked if they could find reasons for optimism, both Ginsberg and Richardson pointed to the rise of some independent local news organizations, shoots of growth in a barren landscape, places like the Baltimore Banner, Charlottesville Tomorrow in Virginia and Outlier Media in Michigan.",
      "As much as they are derided in Trump's America, influential Axios CEO Jim VandeHei noted in a column recently that reporters at mainstream media outlets are still working hard and able to set the nation's agenda with their reporting.",

      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",

      "Betty Boop and \u201cBlondie\u201d are among the highlights of titles entering the public domain with the arrival of 2026",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Betty Boop and \u201cBlondie\u201d are joining Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh in the public domain.",
      "The first appearances of the classic cartoon and comic characters are among the pieces of intellectual property whose 95-year U.S. copyright maximum has been reached, putting them in the public domain on Jan. 1. That means creators can use and repurpose them without permission or payment.",
      "The 2026 batch of newly public artistic creations doesn't quite have the sparkle of the recent first entries into the public domain of Mickey or Winnie. But ever since 2019 \u2014 the end of a 20-year IP drought brought on by congressional copyright extensions \u2014 every annual crop has been a bounty for advocates of more work belonging to the public.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big year,\u201d said Jennifer Jenkins, law professor and director of Duke\u2019s Center for the Study of the Public Domain, for whom New Year's Day is celebrated as Public Domain Day. \u201cIt's just the sheer familiarity of all this culture.\u201d",
      "Jenkins said that, collectively, this year's work shows \u201cthe fragility that was between the two wars and the depths of the Great Depression.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at what will enter the public domain on Thursday, based on the research of Jenkins and her center.",
      "Betty Boop began as a dog. Seriously.",
      "When she first appears in the 1930 short \u201cDizzy Dishes,\u201d one of four of her cartoons entering the public domain, she's already totally recognizable as the Jazz Age flapper later memorialized in countless tattoos, T-shirts and bumper stickers. She has her baby face, short hair with groomed curls, flashy eyelashes and miniature mouth. But she's also got dangling poodle ears and a tiny black nose. Those would soon morph into dangling earrings and a tiny white nose.",
      "She started as essentially the Minnie Mouse to a popular anthropomorphic dog named Bimbo, whom she would eventually outshine \u2014 and push aside. She's got a supporting role in \u201cDizzy Dishes,\u201d performing a slinky song-and-dance in a tiny black dress. She's not named, but sings \u201cboop boop, a doop.\u201d",
      "Jenkins suggests this canine Betty Boop could be rich for exploitation in new works, and has a free idea: \u201cShe was bitten by a radioactive dog, that\u2019s why she had this weird backstory,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThis movie needs to be made.\u201d",
      "The character was designed and owned by Fleischer Studios, and the shorts were released by Paramount Pictures. She was based at least in part on singer Helen Kane, known as the \u201cBoop-Oop-a-Doop Girl,\u201d thanks to a hit 1929 song. Kane would lose a lawsuit over Betty Boop's character and use of the phrase. During the proceedings the defense alleged Black singer Esther Lee Jones used similar phrases first.",
      "Artists are now free to use this earliest Boop in films and similar work. But making merch won't be free. In an important distinction often raised by Disney over Mickey Mouse, a character's trademark is distinct from the copyright of works that feature them. The Fleischer Productions trademark of Betty Boop remains intact.",
      "Boops and doops were apparently in the air in 1930. Blondie Boopadoop was, like Betty, a young flapper, and the central character of Chic Young's newspaper comic strip that debuted in 1930. It inspired a film series and radio show, and is still running today in papers that still have comics.",
      "The strip followed her carefree breeze through life with her boyfriend, Dagwood Bumstead. The two would marry (and she would change her name) in 1933, and the strip would become the sandwich-heavy domestic comedy familiar to later readers. Though the strip was meant to be based on a woman's life, Dagwood would in many ways become its breakout star \u2014 a proto- Adam Driver, if you will, as the breakout actor from \u201cGirls.\u201d",
      "Nine new Mickey Mouse cartoons also are becoming public domain, two years after \u201cSteamboat Willie\u201d made the first version of him public property. He's joined this year by his dog Pluto, who, in 1930, was known as Rover. (He would get his long-term moniker the following year.)",

      "South Korea is chasing a coal-free future in efforts to slash carbon emissions, an ambitious goal for the fossil fuel-dependent country",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.",
      "At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country\u2019s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.",
      "Experts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world\u2019s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.",
      "But as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country\u2019s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.",
      "Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.",
      "South Korea\u2019s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.",
      "Still, it's unclear how South Korea will \u201cmanage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "South Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.",
      "\u201cAs the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,\" Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "South Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists\u2019 expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.",
      "\u201cThis range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,\u201d said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.",
      "The South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping \u2018America First\u2019 tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.",
      "As part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.",
      "The agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.",
      "LNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea\u2019s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.",
      "South Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.",

      "Renewable energy generated 7% of South Korea\u2019s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.",
      "Japan, with an economy more than twice as big, generates 21% of its power from renewable sources. Spain, whose economy is about the same size as South Korea's, gets 42% of its power from renewable sources.",
      "Clean energy provided about 30% of global electricity production in 2023.",
      "Nuclear power produces a major share of South Korea's domestic energy, with government data showing that nuclear sources accounted for 31% of total electricity generation last year.",
      "\u201cWe will transition into a new energy system that focuses on renewables and nuclear, while phasing out coal,\u201d said Kim, the energy minister. He said South Korea will use LNG as a \u201ccomplementary or emergency energy source\u201d to make up for irregularities in renewable energy supplies.",
      "In early December, South Korea set another goal of boosting its offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, about 10 times the current level.",
      "South Korean companies that don\u2019t cut back on carbon emissions may find that to be a competitive disadvantage, said Michelle Kim of the IEEFA.",
      "Many global industries, including shipping and aviation, face pressure to reduce their emissions by providing incentives for low emitters and creating deterrents for high ones, she said.",
      "\u201cThis is a lot of risk,\u201d she said. \u201cSouth Korea needs to speed up renewable energy deployment and come out from high dependency on the fossil fuel industry.\u201d",
      "At last month's climate talks, South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of businesses, organizations and governments promoting the green energy transition.",
      "That's mainly a symbolic move, said Bruce Douglas, with the Global Renewables Alliance. \u201cBut it signifies very clear government intention to move away from fossil fuels and towards clean power.\u201d",
      "South Korea imports virtually all its coal, largely from Australia, Indonesia and Russia, and the switch to renewables is bound to impact regional markets.",
      "The pledge to retire 40 of South Korea's 61 coal sites by 2040 may be \u201can enforced transition\" for coal exporters in the Asia-Pacific region, said James Bowen, with Climate Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality that they\u2019re going to have to face this downturn in the market.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe writing's on the wall,\" Bowen said. \u201cOne of the biggest importers in the world, one of the biggest customers, is starting to move away from coal.\u201d",

      "Sam Reinhart scored for Florida, which was playing outdoors for the first time and lost for the fourth time in its last six contests overall. The Panthers gave up goals to Zibanejad and Panarin 64 seconds apart late in the first period, giving New York a 2-0 lead, and the Rangers kept control the rest of the way.",
      "Panthers coach Paul Maurice said the NHL deserved enormous credit for pulling off an event he called \u201cspectacular.\u201d",
      "\u201cA Southern setting (and) the ice was fine,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cThe spectacle was incredible. It was just brilliant, the entire kind of weekend. ... I would imagine the Rangers really loved it. But for the losing coach, it was an incredible memory.\u201d",
      "Florida outshot New York 37-20 and had 38 hits to New York\u2019s 20, but watched the Rangers block of its 27 shot attempts.",
      "The star of the night was Zibanejad, who reached five points in a game for the fourth time.",

      "The roof was open, as were the huge window panels behind what typically is left field at loanDepot Park \u2014 home of Major League Baseball's Miami Marlins. There was some snow falling from the edges of the stadium, there were blasts of fire and after years of planning, there was hockey on a baseball field.",
      "\u201cAwesome experience,\u201d Panthers defenseman Aaron Ekblad said. \u201cReally happy I was able to able to experience something like this. Would have loved to get the win, but at the end of the day, a true first-class experience.\u201d",

      "Southern Hungary landowner Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti has been battling severe drought on his land",
      "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary -- Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much worse, and it\u2019s getting worse year after year,\u201d he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. \u201dWhere did so much water go? It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Nagyap\u00e1ti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.",
      "The region, known as the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g, has been described by some studies as semiarid \u2014 a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback \u2014 and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.",
      "In a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited \u201cthe combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management\u201d as causes for the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.",
      "Fields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.",
      "Now a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyap\u00e1ti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.",
      "\u201cI was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.\u201d",
      "Along with the group of volunteer \u201cwater guardians,\u201d Nagyap\u00e1ti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water \u2014 which would usually pour unused into a canal \u2014 onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.",
      "According to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2\u00bd-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field \u2014 a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.",
      "\u201cWhen the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2\u00bd hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Hungary\u2019s E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.",
      "The water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.",

      "Tam\u00e1s T\u00f3th, a meteorologist in Hungary, said that because of the potential impact such wetlands can have on the surrounding climate, water retention \u201cis simply the key issue in the coming years and for generations to come, because climate change does not seem to stop.\u201d",
      "\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Following another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.",
      "After a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyap\u00e1ti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.\u201d",
      "He said the added water will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d within a roughly 4-kilometer (2\u00bd-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.\u201d",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce this year the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "After the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.",
      "The group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.\u201d",

      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",

      "But the commercial boom in artificial intelligence has lit a spark under long-simmering visions to build humanoid robots that can move their mechanical bodies like humans and do things that people do.",
      "Alaoui, founder of the Humanoids Summit, gathered more than 2,000 people this week, including top robotics engineers from Disney, Google and dozens of startups, to showcase their technology and debate what it will take to accelerate a nascent industry.",
      "Alaoui says many researchers now believe humanoids or some other kind of physical embodiment of AI are \u201cgoing to become the norm.\"",
      "\u201cThe question is really just how long it will take,\u201d he said.",
      "Disney's contribution to the field, a walking robotic version of \u201cFrozen\u201d character Olaf, will be roaming on its own through Disneyland theme parks in Hong Kong and Paris early next year. Entertaining and highly complex robots that resemble a human \u2014 or a snowman \u2014 are already here, but the timeline for \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d robots that are a productive member of a workplace or household is farther away.",
      "Even at a conference designed to build enthusiasm for the technology, held at a Computer History Museum that's a temple to Silicon Valley's previous breakthroughs, skepticism remained high that truly humanlike robots will take root anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThe humanoid space has a very, very big hill to climb,\u201d said Cosima du Pasquier, co-founder of Haptica Robotics, which works to give robots a sense of touch. \u201cThere's a lot of research that still needs to be solved.\u201d",

      "China is leading in part due to government incentives for component production and robot adoption and a mandate last year \u201cto have a humanoid ecosystem established by 2025,\u201d said McKinsey partner Ani Kelkar. Displays by Chinese firms dominated the expo section of this week's summit, held Thursday and Friday. The conference's most prevalent humanoids were those made by China's Unitree, in part because researchers in the U.S. buy the relatively cheap model to test their own software.",
      "In the U.S., the advent of generative AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini has jolted the decades-old robotics industry in different ways.

      "By mid-December, Trump accused Maduro of \"stealing\" U.S. oil and land. Trump appeared to be alluding to work done in the 1970s in Venezuela by Western oil companies before the government there opted to nationalize its reserves, eventually forcing out American companies.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's supreme leader insisted Saturday that \u201crioters must be put in their place\u201d after a week of protests that have shaken the Islamic Republic, likely giving security forces a green light to aggressively put down the demonstrations.",
      "The first comments by 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei come as violence surrounding the demonstrations sparked by Iran's ailing economy has killed at least 10 people. The protests show no sign of stopping and follow U.S. President Donald Trump warning Iran on Friday that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d the United States \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d",
      "While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. They also take on new importance after Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran.",
      "The protests, have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the protests have yet to be as widespread and intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.",
      "State television aired remarks by Khamenei to an audience in Tehran that sought to separate the concerns of protesting Iranians upset about the rial's collapse from \u201crioters.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe talk to protesters, the officials must talk to them,\u201d Khamenei said. \u201cBut there is no benefit to talking to rioters. Rioters must be put in their place.\u201d",
      "He also reiterated a claim constantly made by officials in Iran that foreign powers like Israel or the United States were pushing the protests, without offering any evidence. He also blamed \u201cthe enemy\u201d for Iran's collapsing rial.",
      "\u201cA bunch of people incited or hired by the enemy are getting behind the tradesmen and shopkeepers and chanting slogans against Islam, Iran and the Islamic Republic,\" he said. \"This is what matters most.\u201d",

      "Hard-line officials within the country are believed to have been pushing for a more-aggressive response to the demonstrations as President Masoud Pezeshkian has sought talks to address protesters' demands.",
      "But bloody security crackdowns often follow such protests. Protests over a gasoline price hike in 2019 reportedly saw over 300 people killed. A crackdown on the Amini protests of 2022, which lasted for months, killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump has spent much of his two-week vacation in Florida golfing. But when he gets back to the White House, there's a military golf course that he's never played that he's eyeing for a major construction project.",
      "Long a favored getaway for presidents seeking a few hours\u2019 solace from the stress of running the free world, the Courses at Andrews \u2014 inside the secure confines of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the White House \u2014 are known as the \u201cpresident's golf course.\" Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that an individual has time to take a couple hours away from the world crises. And they\u2019re people like everybody else,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the former general manager of the course, who has golfed with many of the presidents visiting Andrews over the years.",
      "Andrews, better known as the home of Air Force One, has two 18-hole courses and a 9-hole one. Its facilities have undergone renovations in the past, including in 2018, when Congress approved funding to replace aging presidential aircraft and to build a new hanger and support facilities. That project was close enough to the courses that they had to be altered then, too.",

      "Other golfers, though, describe Andrews\u2019 grounds as in good shape, despite some dry patches. Online reviews praise the course's mature trees, tricky roughs, and ponds and streams that serve as water hazards. The courses are mostly flat, but afford views of the surrounding base.",
      "The first president to golf at Andrews was Ford in 1974. Thomas began working there a couple years later, and was general manager from 1981 until he retired in 2019.",
      "He said the Secret Service over the years used as many as 28 golf carts \u2014 as well as the president's usual 30-car motorcade \u2014 to keep the perimeter secure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a Cecil B. DeMille production every time,\u201d said Thomas, who had the opportunity to play rounds with four different presidents, and with Biden when he was vice president.",
      "He said the commanders in chief generally enjoyed their time out on the course in their own unique ways, but \u201cthey all like to drive the cart because they never get an opportunity to drive.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting your driver\u2019s license all over again,\" Thomas laughed.",
      "Trump golfs most weekends, and as of Jan. 1, has spent an estimated 92 days of his second term doing so, according to an Associated Press analysis of his schedules.",
      "That tally includes days when Trump was playing courses his family owns in Virginia, around 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the White House, and near his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, where he's spending the winter holidays. It also includes 10 days Trump spent staying at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where his schedule allowed time for rounds of golf.",
      "Trump has visited Andrews in the past, but the White House and base have no record of him playing the courses.",
      "Andrews\u2019 military history dates to the Civil War, when Union troops used a church near Camp Springs, Maryland, as sleeping quarters. Its golf course opened in 1960.",

      "The White House said the renovation will be the most significant in the history of Andrews. The courses and clubhouse need improvements due to age and wear, it said, and there are discussions about including a multifunctional event center as part of the project.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is a champion-level golfer with an extraordinary eye for detail and design,\" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement. \"His vision to renovate and beautify Joint Base Andrews' golf courses will bring much-needed improvements that servicemembers and their families will be able to enjoy for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Plans are in the very early stages, and the cost of \u2014 and funding for \u2014 the project haven't been determined, the White House said. Trump has said only that it will require \u201cvery little money.\"",
      "The Andrews improvements join a bevy of Trump construction projects, including demolishing the White House\u2019s East Wing for a sprawling ballroom now expected to cost $400 million, redoing the bathroom attached to the Lincoln bedroom and replacing the Rose Garden\u2019s lawn with a Mar-a-Lago-like patio area.",
      "Outside the White House, Trump has led building projects at the Kennedy Center and wants to erect a Paris-style arch near the Lincoln Memorial, and has said he wants to rebuild Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.",
      "On Wednesday, meanwhile, the Trump administration ended a lease agreement with a non-profit for three public golf courses in Washington \u2014 which could allow the president to further shape golfing in the nation's capital. The White House, however, said that move isn't related to the plans for Andrews.",
      "When the president is golfing, Andrews officials block off nine holes at a time so no one plays in front of him, allowing for extra security while also ensuring consistent speed-of-play, Thomas said.",
      "That's relatively easily done given that the courses aren't open to the public. They're usually reserved for active or retired members of the military and their families, as well as some Defense Department-linked federal employees.",
      "Thomas remembers playing a round with the older President Bush, a World Golf Hall of Fame inductee known for fast play, while first lady Barbara Bush walked with Millie, the first couple\u2019s English Springer Spaniel. George W. Bush also played fast, Thomas said, and got additional exercise by frequently riding his mountain bike before golfing.",
      "When he wasn't golfing at Andrews, Obama tried to recreate at least part of the experience back home. He had a White House golf simulator installed after then-first lady Michelle Obama asked Thomas how they might acquire a model that the president had seen advertised on the Golf Channel. Thomas gave her a contact at the network.",
      "Obama famously cut short a round at Andrews after nine holes in 2011 to hustle back to the White House for what turned out to be a top-secret review of final preparations for a Navy Seal raid on the compound of Osama Bin Laden.",

      "Minnesota officials have until next week to hand over information on providers and parents who receive federal child care funds that the Trump administration contends have been used fraudulently or risk losing federal funding. State officials said Friday recent inspections showed several childcare centers accused of fraud by a right-wing influencer were \u201coperating as expected.\u201d",
      "In an email sent Friday to child care providers and shared with The Associated Press by multiple providers, Minnesota\u2019s Department of Children, Youth, and Families said it has until Jan. 9 to provide information about recipients of the funds.",
      "The announcement earlier this week by the Trump administration that it would freeze child care funds to Minnesota and the rest of the states comes after a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which many defendants were Somali, as were many of those running spotlighted childcare centers.",
      "Allegations of fraud at the child care centers went viral recently when a right-wing influencer posted a video claiming there was fraud taking place, putting Minnesota and some other states in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.",
      "State officials said investigators did spot checks and reviews of nine centers this week in response to the influencer's video posted last week, and found no operational issues. One center was not yet open at the time, and there are ongoing investigations at four of them.",
      "The email sent Friday instructed providers and families who rely on the frozen federal child care program to continue the program\u2019s \u201clicensing and certification requirements and practices as usual.\u201d It does not say that recipients themselves need to take any action or provide any information.",
      "\u201cWe recognize the alarm and questions this has raised,\u201d the email said. \u201cWe found out about the freezing of funds at the same time everyone else did on social media.\u201d",
      "The state agency added that it \u201cdid not receive a formal communication from the federal government until late Tuesday night,\u201d which was after Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O\u2019Neill posted about the freeze on X. All 50 states will have to provide additional levels of verification and administrative data before they receive more funding from the Child Care and Development Fund, which is designed to make child care affordable for low-income families.",
      "The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold a hearing Wednesday to discuss the allegations of fraudulent use of federal funds in Minnesota.

      "Minnesota has drawn ire from Republicans and the Trump administration over other fraud accusations.",
      "Administration for Children and Families Assistant Secretary Alex Adams told Fox News on Friday that his agency sent Minnesota a letter last month asking for information on the child care program and other welfare programs by Dec. 26, but didn't get a response.

      "Maria Snider, director of a child care center in St. Paul and vice president of advocacy group Minnesota Child Care Association, said providers currently get paid at least three weeks after services are provided. Some 23,000 children and 12,000 families receive funding from the targeted child care program each month on average, according to the state.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of centers, we\u2019re already running on a thin margin,\u201d she said. \u201cEven centers where 10 to 15% of their kids are on childcare assistance, that\u2019s a dip in your income.\u201d",

      "Dykstra, 62, was a passenger when the vehicle was pulled over by a trooper with the Blooming Grove patrol unit in Pike County, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Scranton, where Dykstra lives.",
      "Police said in a statement that charges will be filed but did not specify what they may be or what drugs were allegedly involved.",
      "Matthew Blit, Dykstra's lawyer, said in a statement that the vehicle did not belong to Dykstra and any charges brought against him \u201cwill be swiftly absolved.\u201d",
      "\u201cLenny was not accused of being under the influence of any substance at the scene, nor was he arrested or taken into custody at the scene,\u201d Blit said.",
      "Dykstra's gritty style of play over a long career with the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies earned him the nickname \u201cNails.\u201d He spent years as a businessman before running into a series of legal woes.",
      "Dykstra served time in a California prison for bankruptcy fraud, sentenced to more than six months for hiding baseball gloves and other items from his playing days. That ran concurrent with a three-year sentence for pleading no contest to grand theft auto and providing a false financial statement. He claimed he owed more than $31 million and had only $50,000 in assets.",

    "story": [
      "One of the first officers on the scene at the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, is about to stand trial",
      "Families who lost loved ones in the 2022 attack on an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, have sought for nearly four years to hold accountable the police who waited more than an hour to confront the shooter while children and teachers lay dead or wounded in classrooms.",
      "Now one of the first officers on the scene is about to stand trial on multiple charges of child abandonment and endangerment. Former Uvalde schools police officer Adrian Gonzales is accused of ignoring his training in a crisis with deadly consequences. His attorney insists he was focused on helping children escape from the building.",
      "The trial that starts Monday offers potentially one of the last chances to see police answer for the long delay. The families have pinned their hopes on the jury after their gun-control efforts were rejected by lawmakers, and their lawsuits remain unresolved. A few parents ran for political office to seek change, with mixed results.",
      "The proceedings will provide a rare example of an officer being criminally charged with not doing more to stop a crime and protect lives.",
      "Jesse Rizo's niece was one of 19 children and two teachers killed by the teenage gunman in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. Nine-year-old Jackie Cazares still had a pulse when rescuers finally reached her, Rizo said.",
      "\u201cIt really bothers us a lot that maybe she could have lived,\u201d he said.",
      "Only two of the 376 officers from local, state and federal agencies on the scene have been charged \u2014 a fact that haunts Velma Lisa Duran, whose sister, Irma Garcia, was one of the teachers gunned down.",
      "\"What about the other 374?\" Duran asked through tears. \"They all waited and allowed children and teachers to die.\u201d",
      "The charges reflect the dead and wounded children, but not her sister's death or that of the other teacher who was killed.",
      "\u201cWhere is the justice in that?\u201d Duran asked. \u201cDid she not exist?\u201d",
      "Prosecutors will likely face a high bar to win a conviction. Juries are often reluctant to convict law enforcement officers for inaction, as seen after the Parkland, Florida, school massacre in 2018.",
      "Sheriff\u2019s deputy Scot Peterson was charged with failing to confront the shooter in that attack. It was the first such prosecution in the U.S. for an on-campus shooting, and Peterson was acquitted by a jury in 2023.",
      "Police and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott initially said swift law enforcement action killed Uvalde gunman Salvador Ramos and saved lives. But that version quickly unraveled as families described begging police to go into the building and 911 calls emerged from students pleading for help.",
      "The reality was that 77 minutes passed from the time officers first arrived until a tactical team breached the classroom and killed Ramos.",
      "Multiple reports from state and federal officials cataloged cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and they questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of the children and teachers.",
      "Gonzales was charged two years later in an indictment that alleged he placed children in \u201cimminent danger\u201d of injury or death by failing to engage, distract or delay the gunman and by not following his active shooter training.",
      "The indictment said he did not advance toward the gunfire despite hearing shots and being told where the shooter was.",
      "The only other officer to be charged is former Uvalde schools Police Chief Pete Arredondo. His trial on similar charges has not yet been set.",
      "Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell did not respond to requests from The Associated Press for comment on the indictments or whether a grand jury considered charging other officers.",
      "According to a report by state lawmakers, Gonzales was among the first officers in the building. They heard gunfire and retreated without firing a shot after Ramos shot at them.",
      "Gonzales told investigators he later helped break windows to remove students from other classrooms.",

      "The families have sought justice through multiple legal paths. Federal and state lawsuits have been filed against law enforcement, a gun manufacturer, a video game company and the Meta social media company over the shooting. Those cases are still pending.",
      "The families reached a $2 million settlement with the city that promised higher standards and better training for police.",
      "Relatives also lobbied state and federal lawmakers for stricter gun control laws that never advanced. But earlier this year, Texas lawmakers passed the Uvalde Strong Act, which sets new requirements for active shooter training and shooting response plans for police and schools.",
      "Duran wants accountability not just for her sister but also for a beloved brother-in-law who died two days after the shooting.",
      "Irma's husband, Joe, was watching a television report on the shooting when he heard that authorities missed their chance to end the attack quickly. He immediately fell to the floor with an apparent heart attack, Duran said.",
      "The conviction of a single officer out of almost 400 would bring little in the way of justice, Duran said.",
      "\u201cThe only justice is going to be when they take their final breath,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then God will judge them.\u201d",

      "New Year's Day commemorates the passing of time and the start of a new chapter, so it is fitting that the same day also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into thousands of creative works nearly a century old. As of Jan. 1, 2026, characters like early Betty Boop and Nancy Drew, and a variety of popular movies, books and songs, have entered the the public domain.",
      "They join a growing list of cultural icons that are no longer under copyright protection, including Popeye the Sailor Man and the \"Steamboat Willie\" version of Mickey Mouse.",
      "List of popular intellectual property entering the public domain in 2026",
      "The year 2026 marks the first time that copyrighted books, films, songs and art published in the '30s enter the U.S. public domain. As of Jan. 1, protections have expired for published works from 1930 and sound recordings from 1925.",
      "Here are some of the most notable works that are now available for free use by anyone:",
      "\"The Murder at the Vicarage\" by Agatha Christie, the first novel featuring elderly amateur detective Miss Marple.\"The Secret of the Old Clock\" by Carolyn Keene, the first appearance of teen detective Nancy Drew, and three follow-ups.\"The Little Engine That Could\" by Watty Piper.Fleischer Studios' \"Dizzy Dishes,\" the first cartoon in which Betty Boop appears.Disney's \"The Chain Gang\" and \"The Picnic,\" both depicting the earliest versions of Mickey's dog Pluto.The initial four months of \"Blondie\" comic strips by Chic Young, featuring the earliest iterations of the titular character and her then-boyfriend, Dagwood.The film \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" directed by Lewis Milestone, Best Picture winner at the 3rd Academy Awards.\"King of Jazz,\" directed by John Murray Anderson, Bing Crosby's first appearance in a feature film.\"Animal Crackers,\" directed by Victor Heerman and starring the Marx Brothers.\"The Big Trail,\" directed by Raoul Walsh, John Wayne's first turn as leading man.\"But Not For Me,\" music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin.\"Georgia on My Mind,\" music by Hoagy Carmichael, lyrics by Stuart Gorrell.\"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" music by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt, lyrics by Gus Kahn.\"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,\" music by Al Sherman, lyrics by Al Lewis.Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",

      "Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",
      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",
      "The decision was also defended by Vedrenne's superior at the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, who said he signed the naturalization decree.",
      "\"It's a big chance for our country,\" he said.",
      "In recent media interviews, when he was promoting \"Jay Kelly,\" Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app. He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly.",
      "\"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French\u00a0broadcaster Canal+.",
      "French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.",
      "In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney said: \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\"",
      "\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he said. Growing up away from the spotlight in France, \"they have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"",

Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",

Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",

But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

In another series of messages dated Aug. 31 this year, Rodriguez described ongoing health problems, said he lacked health insurance and told Perry he was scared and struggling financially.",

Perry also has denied Dixon's allegations.",

      "Martha turned and fled through the crowd, down the wide flight of stone steps, and out into Beaumont Street, looking at nothing but the ground. Three corners later, she found a side road and turned into it. She put her back against the wall and tried to breathe.",
      "She had known there would be ghosts in Oxford. She wasn't afraid of any headless horsemen or nuns haunting the local ruins; it was Charlie, always Charlie she was afraid would find her. There had been times in the first year after her sister's disappearance when Martha's heart would stop as she spotted her through the crowd: the long blond hair, the shapeless cardigan draped over a thin cotton dress. She'd hear a laugh, throaty and sudden, or catch a movement, a walk, a twist in the shoulders, and she'd be certain. Just for a moment. Then the illusion would shatter, and the person she knew to be her sister would resolve into a stranger.",
      "As the years passed, so the ghost of Charlie aged. Now it was women in their midthirties who made Martha stop dead in the streets. In Berlin, once a month perhaps, she'd felt that same flickering certainty before realizing the woman with a child on her lap as she drank a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 was not her sister, just an echo of Martha's own image of who Charlie might be now, thirteen years after fleeing Oxford and her family.",
      "Martha pressed her palm against the wall behind her. She reminded herself of her therapist's mantra for the moments when she was in danger of being overwhelmed. What can you see now? The shiny cobbles of the side street, the white brick of the wall opposite. What can you feel? The bricks under my fingers, a breeze ruffling my hair. What can you smell? Cooking oil, the Black Opium perfume I put on this morning.",
      "Her breathing slowed.",
      "She pulled the letter out of her bag again and stared at it. Could it be from Charlie? Impossible. What could this Chorus know? Should she burn it? Throw it in the river? Take it to the police?",
      "Ah, the police. She heard the scrape of her mother's chair on the kitchen floor as she leaped up at the sound of the doorbell. They had found Charlie's bike not far from the ring road. Did she hitchhike? How was her PhD going? Martha couldn't remember their faces, just their hands around tea mugs as they sat at the table, the low rumble of their voices as they talked about stress and pressure. Most runaways come back in time, they'd said. They left literature, helpline numbers, and world-weary sympathy behind them.",
      "Martha realized she was at her own front door. Her body had picked her up and carried her here through the gathering dark. She looked up. All the lights were off; her father must be in bed.",
      "Charlie had been living here when she went missing, taking advantage of the space, their mum's cooking, and the glow of parental approval while she slogged through her PhD. Martha had just left for university and was starting to experiment with life out of Charlie's orbit.",
      "As she put her key in the lock, she remembered Alex's shadow moving across the folded letter at the museum. Now it was Charlie's. Always here: the shadows of the past thrown against the walls and floors. She pushed open the door\u2026.",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

      "A 1998 U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandate required folic acid to be added to certain enriched grains, such as pasta and rice, but not to corn masa products.",
      "Since then, Latina women have not seen any decrease in their babies being born with neural tube defects in their brains and spinal cords, which is why lawmakers are targeting tortillas.",
      "\"I really was in shock because we grow with these kinds of tortillas since generations, and we never have any problems. We have healthy kids,\" said Dora Sanz, who is the owner of 3 Hermanas in east Sacramento.",

      "\"So like, do we really need to put these in the tortillas?\" said Sanz.",
      "Sana Jaffery is the legislative director for Fresno Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula, who authored the bill. She said it costs four pennies to fortify a metric ton of corn masa, but hundreds of dollars for supplements where you get the same vitamins.",
      "Jaffery said lawmakers have briefly looked into making supplements more affordable, but it is a separate issue.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming. Without strong safeguards and independent detection, manipulated media can \u2014and will \u2014 be weaponized,\" Copyleaks said in a blog post.",
      "\"Spicy mode\" controversy",
      "Grok has previously drawn scrutiny before for generating sexually inappropriate content.

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",

      "Businesses",
      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax. He had previously resided in San Francisco.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:04:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies and served as vice chairman of Berkshire's board of directors.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

    "summary": "Tesla's electric vehicle sales fell 9% in 2025 from a year ago amid the expiration of a $7,500 EV U.S. tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla on Friday reported a second straight annual drop in electric vehicle sales, as the phaseout of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit and mounting competition weighed on demand. With the decline, Tesla lost its title as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker.",
      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla rose $4.16, or 0.9%, to $453.88 in early trading Friday.",
      "Cheaper Tesla models",
      "The latest quarter was the first reporting period that includes sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3, which Tesla unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-health-subsidies-insurance-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 21:14:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight.",
    "story": [
      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight as 2026 arrived, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one's efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don't get their health insurance from an employer and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters' concerns.",
      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Steep U.S. import duties targeting 13 Italian pasta makers will be sharply reduced, Italy's foreign ministry said on Jan. 1.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognize our companies' genuine willingness to cooperate,\" the foreign ministry said.",
      "La Molisana pasta imports will be tariffed at a rate of 2.26%, the foreign ministry said, while Garofalo will face nearly 14% tariffs, and 11 additional pasta brands will be subject to a 9% import duty.",
      "A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CBS News that the new antidumping rates were based on an \"evaluation of additional comments received\" after the proposed duty rates were determined.",
      "\"This post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects Commerce's commitment to a fair, transparent process. Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The final results of Commerce's review will be announced in March, after which the duties will go into effect.",

      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",

      "A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a\u00a0climate change tourist tax\u00a0on cruise ship passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake last week upheld the law, and the plaintiffs appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government intervened in the case and also appealed Otake's ruling.",
      "The order by two 9th Circuit judges granted both requests for an injunction pending the appeals.",
      "\"We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the appeal is heard on the merits,\" Toni Schwartz, spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general's office, said in an email.",
      "The order temporarily halts enforcement of the law on cruise ships while the appeals process moves forward, her email noted.",

    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level of 2025 this week, a boost for prospective home buyers.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Most homes across U.S. are unaffordable",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don't have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market\u00a0is also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours. Yet stock valuations remain below the levels seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. He expects investment in AI to continue next year as more companies adopt the technology.",
      "Still, although AI stocks are unlikely to crash next year, investors' lofty expectations may be in for a reality check",
      "\"At some point, investors are likely to be disappointed, and the cycle of ever rising investment, expectations and valuations will end, as proved the case with previous equity bubbles,\" Goltermann said in a report.",
      "Overall, forecasters expect a strong stock market performance in 2026. J.P. Morgan in November forecast the S&P 500 will rise 13% to 15% next year, roughly in line with the index's average gain over the last decade.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:15:15 -0500",
    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.",
      "And while the federal government says the licenses are illegal and the state says the feds are overreaching, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle, reports CBS News Sacramento.",

      "Yet the move was approved by a 9-3 vote, an unusual level of dissent for a committee that typically works by consensus. Two Fed officials supported keeping the rate unchanged, while one wanted a larger, half-point reduction.",
      "The minutes underscored the deep split on the 19-member policymaking committee over what constitutes the biggest threat to the economy: weak hiring or stubbornly elevated inflation. If a sluggish job market is the biggest threat, then the Fed would typically cut rates more. But if still-high inflation is the bigger problem, then the Fed would keep rates elevated, or even raise them.",
      "Just 12 of the 19 members vote on rate decisions, though all participate in discussions.",
      "The minutes showed that even some Fed officials who supported the rate cut did so with reservations. Some Fed officials wanted to wait for more economic data before making any further moves, the minutes said. Key economic data on jobs, inflation, and growth were delayed by the six-week government shutdown, leaving Fed officials with only outdated information at their meeting earlier this month.",
      "The minutes don't identify specific officials. But how they vote is public, and two policymakers dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged: Jeffrey Schmid, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed.",
      "The third dissent was from Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in September and favored a half-point cut.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, over time it can lower borrowing costs for homes, cars, and credit cards, though market forces also affect those rates.",
      "At its December meeting, the Fed also released quarterly economic projections, which also showed the extent of the divisions on the Fed committee. Seven officials projected no cuts in 2026, while eight forecast two or more reductions. Four supported just one cut.",
      "Weaker job market",
      "A weaker job market would likely spur the Fed to reduce borrowing costs more quickly. Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers had cut about 40,000 jobs in October and November, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.",
      "Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the Fed's 2% target, complicating the central bank's next moves. In November, annual inflation cooled to 2.7%, down from 3% in September, but last month's data were likely distorted by the shutdown, economists said, which forced the government to estimate many price changes rather than measuring them directly.",
      "Powell said after the Dec. 10 meeting that the central bank cut rates out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears.",
      "While government data shows that the economy added just 40,000 jobs a month from April through September, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers actually shed an average of 20,000 jobs a month during that period.",
      "\"It's a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,\" Powell told reporters. \"People care about that. That's their jobs.\"",

      "Investors have been piling into precious metals this year as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions, as well as a hedge against inflation. That's helped drive sharp gains in both silver and gold.",
      "\"Silver saw a record rally in 2025. The 150% increase is significantly higher than that of gold and other assets in the sector,\" noted Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email.",

      "Monday's selloff in silver was sparked by a technical change at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's largest commodities trading venues. The exchange said it would require traders to put up more cash to hold positions in silver, gold and other metals after prices surged this year.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "The White House may not stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, days before funds at the bureau were likely to run out and the consumer finance agency would lack the funds to pay its employees.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman ruled the CFPB can continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is operating at a loss, and the White House has made a new legal argument that way the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
      "At the heart of this case is whether White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who is also the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump was sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Vought himself has made comments indicating he intends to effectively shut down the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in its legal efforts to stop the mass layoffs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs.",
      "In recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's restraining order. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no \"combined earnings\" at the moment to fund the CFPB's operations. The CFPB obtains its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks that hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a \"deferred asset\" on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.",
      "Because of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no \"combined earnings\" for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under Mr. Trump's first term, drawing on the Fed's operating budget.",
      "White House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, under the \"combined earnings\" argument, and does not expect to receive any additional appropriations from Congress.",
      "This combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to the moment the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. However, it has never been tested in court.",
      "\"It appears that defendants' new understanding of \"combined earnings\" is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court's injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.",
      "A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:50:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The company's investment in safety prevention comes amid growing concerns over the potential harm of artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI is seeking a new \"head of preparedness\" to guide the company's safety strategy amid mounting concerns over how artificial intelligence tools could be misused.",
      "According to the job posting, the new hire will be paid $555,000 to lead the company's safety systems team, which OpenAI says is focused on ensuring AI models are \"responsibly developed and deployed.\" The head of preparedness will also be tasked with tracking risks and developing mitigation strategies for what OpenAI calls \"frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.\"",
      "\"This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" CEO Sam Altman wrote in an\u00a0X\u00a0post describing the position over the weekend.",
      "He added, \"This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges.\"",
      "Reached for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred CBS News to Altman's post on X.",
      "The company's investment in safety efforts comes as scrutiny intensifies over artificial intelligence's influence on mental health, following multiple\u00a0allegations\u00a0that OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, was involved in interactions preceding a number of suicides.",
      "In one case earlier this year\u00a0covered by CBS News, the parents of a 16-year-old sued the company, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son to plan his own suicide. That prompted OpenAI to announce new safety protocols for users under 18.",
      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",
      "According to the job posting, a qualified applicant would have \"deep technical expertise in machine learning, AI safety, evaluations, security or adjacent risk domains\" and have experience with \"designing or executing high-rigor evaluations for complex technical systems,\" among other qualifications.",
      "OpenAI first announced the creation of a preparedness team in 2023, according to TechCrunch.",

Bondi said Maduro and his wife \"will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.\"",

We were prepared, we had, you know, massive blow torches and everything else that you need to get through that steel, but we didn't need it. He didn't make it to that area of the house.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard said late Friday it has called off a dayslong search for several people in the Eastern Pacific who jumped overboard when their alleged drug-trafficking boats were targeted by the U.S. military.",
      "The military says it struck a group of three boats on Tuesday \u2014 part of a monthslong campaign of airstrikes that the Trump administration says are targeting Latin American drug cartels at sea. But after the first boat was struck, killing three, as many as eight people aboard the other two boats abandoned their vessels, U.S. officials told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "The Coast Guard said in a statement that the people were reported missing about 400 nautical miles off the Mexico-Guatemala border. The search lasted about 65 hours and covered an area of ocean that spanned more than 1,090 nautical miles, but multiple search boats did not spot any \"survivors or debris,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "\"At this stage of the response, the likelihood of a successful outcome, based on elapsed time, environmental conditions, and available resources for a person in the water is very low,\" Coast Guard Capt. Patrick Dill said in the statement.",
      "The search was carried out by a Coast Guard plane that took off from California, a vessel in the area that belonged to the Coast Guard's emergency assistance system and three other nearby vessels that were asked to help. The Coast Guard said in its statement that \"available assets were extremely limited due to distance and range constraints.\"",
      "A Coast Guard spokesperson told CBS News earlier Friday that 40-knot winds and nine-foot seas were reported in the area.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro \u2014 who has clashed with the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 wrote on X Friday that the people appeared to survive the strikes. He said the Colombian Navy was willing to assist.",
      "The U.S. military has conducted at least 35 boat strikes in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific between Sept. 2 and Dec. 31, killing at least 115 people.",
      "The military has reported survivors in a handful of boat strikes \u2014 and has faced heavy scrutiny for its handling of those cases. Two survivors from a mid-October strike were detained by the U.S. Navy and then repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador. One survivor from a late October operation is presumed dead after the Mexican Navy called off a search for the person.",
      "And in the Trump administration's first set of boat strikes on Sept. 2, two people survived the initial attack but were killed in a follow-on strike. Congressional Democrats who viewed a video of the operation criticized the second strike, alleging the military killed shipwrecked people who no longer posed a threat, but GOP lawmakers have called the strike justifiable, arguing the survivors appeared to still be in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader military buildup in the region, amid a growing U.S. pressure campaign against the regime of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The Trump administration has accused Maduro's government of working with drug cartels, which it denies.",
      "The operations have drawn criticism from lawmakers who argue the president is operating without permission from Congress. The Trump administration has defended the strikes as necessary to combat drug trafficking, calling the targets \"unlawful combatants.\"",

    "summary": "As U.S.-Iran tension soars, Trump warns violence against protesters could bring an American intervention: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump warned Friday in a social media post that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "Mr. Trump offered no further comment on Iran or how the U.S. might intervene to protect protesters in the country in the post on his Truth Social network, which was published just before 3 a.m. Eastern, but he said: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "It came hours after reports that at least eight people have been killed amid nearly a week of escalating protests in Iran. The unrest began last weekend as business owners voiced frustration at the dire economic conditions in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran has been plagued for years by staggering hyperinflation, fueled by Western sanctions imposed over the hardline clerical government's nuclear program and backing for militant groups across the region.",
      "Protests continued Friday in various cities in the country, The Associated Press reported, even as life largely continued unaffected in the capital, Tehran. Demonstrations have reached over 100 locations in 22 of Iran's 31 provinces, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported. It said the death toll in the demonstrations rose with the death of a demonstrator in Marvdasht in Iran's Fars province.",
      "Videos and photos from Tehran and other cities posted on social media have shown protesters marching through streets from early this week, often chanting anti-government, pro-monarchy slogans and sometimes clashing violently with security forces.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News the current round of protests were triggered in part by shopkeepers upset by Iran's weakening currency. Shopkeepers tend to be a fairly conservative group, he noted, but many have warned that the country's economic troubles have made operating their businesses untenable.",
      "\"They don't come out in the streets unless they really have to,\" Vatanka said. \"And they've done it now, which sort of gives you an indication how dire the situation has become.\"",
      "In an apparent bid to quell the unrest, Iranian authorities have acknowledged the economic concerns and said peaceful protests are legitimate, but suggested that foreign powers \u2014 usually a reference to Israel and the U.S. \u2014 are behind subversive elements fueling violence on the streets.",
      "Reacting to the latest remarks by the U.S. president, Ali Larijani, a former speaker of Iran's parliament who's now the secretary of the country's National Security Council, said Friday in his own social media post that \"Trump should know that intervention by the U.S. in the domestic problem corresponds to chaos in the entire region and the destruction of the U.S. interests.\"",
      "\"The people of the U.S. should know that Trump began the adventurism,\" said Larijani.",
      "\"They should take care of their own soldiers,\" he added, in what appeared to be a reference to the U.S. military forces based across the Middle East, who are in easy range of Iran's vast stockpile of ballistic missiles.",
      "There was a more sternly worded warning from Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said \"any interventionist hand that gets too close to the security of Iran will be cut.\"",
      "\"The people of Iran properly know the experience of 'being rescued' by Americans: from Iraq and Afghanistan to Gaza,\" he said in a social media post.",
      "Both the U.S. and Israeli governments had issued statements in support of the protests in Iran prior to Mr. Trump's warning on Friday morning of a possible, unspecified U.S. intervention.",
      "\"The people of Iran want freedom. They have suffered at the hands of the Ayatollahs for too long,\" Mike Waltz, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said in a post on X earlier this week. \"We stand with Iranians in the streets of Tehran and across the country as they protest a radical regime that has brought them nothing but economic downturn and war.\"",
      "Vatanka told CBS News it's not clear what steps the Trump administration might take to support the protesters or push back on a crackdown by the Iranian regime. But he believes Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden the protesters.",
      "\"We shouldn't underestimate the value of an American president who floats the idea of U.S. support for the protests,\" he said. \"It could just be the ... one ingredient you need to keep this movement, the street-level movement alive, because in recent years, these protests have tended to sort of die down after a few days [or a] few weeks.\"",
      "Tension between the U.S. and Iran escalated this week on the heels of a visit to the U.S. by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has campaigned his country's close allies in Washington for decades to take a tougher stance on Iran.",
      "After meeting with Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Sunday, Mr. Trump said he had heard that Iran could be attempting to rebuild its nuclear program following the unprecedented U.S. strikes on its enrichment facilities in June. Mr. Trump warned that if Iran did try to rebuild, \"we'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Iranian President Mahsoud Pezeshkian said Tehran would respond \"to any cruel aggression\" with unspecified \"harsh and discouraging\" measures.",
      "Iran is no stranger to nationwide protests, and the latest demonstrations have not come close to the last major outbreak in 2022, which was triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian woman.",
      "Her death in custody after being arrested for allegedly violating the nation's strict dress code for women sparked a wave of anger across the nation. Several hundred people were killed, including dozens of members of the security forces, who waged a dramatic crackdown in response, arresting hundreds of people.",
      "There were also widespread protests in 2019, sparked by a sharp increase in the price of petrol.",
      "The standoff between Iran and the U.S. over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program reached a crescendo in June, when Mr. Trump ordered the deadly military strikes against Iran's enrichment facilities, as Israel also carried out strikes on the country.",
      "While Mr. Trump indicated earlier this week that the U.S. could take new action if Iran were to rebuild its nuclear program, Friday's brief post on social media was the first suggestion of a possible American intervention on behalf of Iranian protesters.",

      "As 2025 gives way to 2026, there is one story that's captured the nation's attention. It's not the striking of boats off the coast of Venezuela allegedly transporting drugs, or China's announcement of military maneuvers around Taiwan. It is the story of fraud in Minnesota, which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion.",
      "A viral social media video by YouTuber Nick Shirley, which was amplified by Elon Musk, Vice President J.D. Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi, has put the issue into the center of the national conversation, stoking a scandal that has been brewing in state politics for years.",
      "In the wake of the video, the Trump administration announced it is pausing federal funding to child care in Minnesota, with President Trump calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping changes to how all states must submit claims for Medicaid-supported daycares, including requiring \"a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"",
      "Even before the video spread far across the internet, however, scandal plagued Minnesota. In 2021, federal law enforcement first probed a series of multimillion dollar fraud schemes. Those fraud schemes have led to federal charges against 92 people with 62 convicted \u2014 and counting.",
      "President Trump and other Republican lawmakers have focused attention on the state's large Somali community, as most of the fraud defendants are of Somali descent, drawing stiff criticism from local officials, including the state's Democratic Governor Tim Walz, who denounced Mr. Trump's criticism as \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Walz, meanwhile, has faced intense scrutiny from both inside and outside Minnesota over his administration's handling of the crisis. The governor has acknowledged in recent weeks that the fraud problem could stretch into the billions, but disputed the $9 billion figure cited by prosecutors.",
      "While Shirley's video focused on allegations of fraud in daycares in Minneapolis, federal investigators told CBS News child care is only \"vaguely\" a priority for prosecutors, and attention and resources are instead focused on more than a dozen other social services programs in Minnesota, including nutrition, housing and behavioral health.",

      "Feeding Our Future: The case that started it all",
      "This COVID-era $250 million scheme \u2014 which now includes upwards of 75 defendants \u2014 revolved around a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future. The group claimed to work with restaurants and caterers to distribute meals to schools and extracurricular programs but instead submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices, raking in millions in administrative fees and getting kickbacks from people who ran their meal distribution sites, prosecutors said.\u00a0Feeding Our Future founder Aimee Bock was convicted earlier this year, and several others involved in the scheme have pleaded guilty or been convicted.Early on, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of reimbursements, prompting Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of racial discrimination. The state auditor's office found that \"the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention\" affected the state's decision-making process about regulatory action against Feeding Our Future.What federal prosecutors called \"the largest pandemic era fraud in the United States\" is \"just the tip of a very large iceberg,\" according to FBI Director Kash Patel.",

They also wired millions in stolen funds overseas, including to banks and companies in China, where finding the recipients of that cash can become an investigative black hole.

    "summary": "The Trump administration is aiming to move a planned 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom through the federal government's review process at a rapid clip, with final approvals as soon as early March.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is aiming to move a planned 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom through the federal government's review process at a rapid clip, with final approvals as soon as early March \u2014 potentially clearing the way for construction to start a month later.",
      "President Trump has sought to move quickly on the ballroom project, which is the most ambitious \u2014 and controversial \u2014 part of his push to transform the White House complex in line with his aesthetic vision. But the $400 million donor-funded project still needs to get approvals from two boards that oversee federal construction in Washington, D.C.: the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA).",
      "Administration officials met with the two boards and presented drawings on Dec. 19, and formally submitted applications three days later, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "The administration is aiming to hold a public informational meeting before the NCPC next week, on Jan. 8, with a meeting before the CFA one week later. Final presentations to the CFA and NCPC are slated for Feb. 19 and March 5, respectively, the official said.",
      "The National Park Service said in a court filing last month that above-grade construction is \"not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest.\" Construction is expected to wrap up in the summer of 2028, less than a year before Mr. Trump leaves office, according to a National Park Service assessment filed in court last month.",
      "NCPC spokesperson Stephen Staudigl and CFA Secretary Thomas Luebke confirmed to CBS News that the timeline is accurate.",
      "Staudigl said the White House consulted with the NCPC last month, and is expected to give a presentation on the project at a Jan. 8 public meeting. Luebke said the CFA will review a concept design \u2014 an initial step in the approval process \u2014 on Jan. 15, but the \"timing of the final approval submission lies with the applicant.\"",
      "The Washington Post was\u00a0first to report\u00a0the timing of NCPC and CFA approvals.",
      "The dates of the NCPC and CFA meetings could shift somewhat. But the administration's timeline for the ballroom is extremely aggressive by the standards of the federal government, which often takes months or years to secure approvals for far smaller projects.",
      "It took several years to design, approve and build a new perimeter fence on the White House grounds during the Obama and first Trump administrations. Officials formally asked the NCPC to review the fencing project concept in June 2016, and the board eventually greenlit the plans in February 2017. Construction on the fence began in 2019.",
      "Approvals took even longer for a pricy project to renovate the Federal Reserve's headquarters, with seven public meetings before the NCPC between September 2019 and March 2021. The commission approved the project in September 2021, and construction is still ongoing.",
      "The NCPC is chaired by White House aide William Scharf, and two other Trump appointees currently serve on the commission. Mr. Trump fired all six sitting members of the CFA in October and is expected to appoint a slate of new members shortly.",
      "Plans for the ballroom have come together at a rapid pace. The White House first announced the project in July. By October, construction crews had demolished the building's entire East Wing, though Mr. Trump said months earlier that the existing structure would be left intact.",
      "At a mid-October dinner to recognize private donors to the ballroom, Mr. Trump marveled at how quickly he was able to get the project off the ground.",
      "\"They said, 'Sir, you can start tonight,\" the president told guests, recounting conversations with staff about the ballroom. \"'You have zero zoning conditions. You're the president.'\"",
      "That approach has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats and preservation\u00a0 groups, who argue the administration failed to properly engage with the public before taking a wrecking ball to part of the White House complex. The White House has argued that NCPC approval is only required for vertical construction, not demolition.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation sued over the project late last year, seeking a temporary halt to construction work until the government gets any necessary approvals. The group has criticized the administration for tearing down the East Wing without seeking reviews and argued the ballroom's size \"will overwhelm the White House itself.\"",
      "\"The American people own these places. And we, the American people, have a right to weigh in when significant changes to them are proposed,\" Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said in an interview with CBS News last month. \"This project needs to follow the already legally mandated processes.\"",
      "A judge last month declined to pause construction outright, but said the administration had to\u00a0 engage the NCPC by the end of 2025. Further hearings on the Trust's request for a preliminary injunction are set for later this month. The judge told the government that if it does any underground construction that \"dictates the size or scale of the proposed ballroom\" before he has a chance to rule, the government \"should be prepared to take it down.\"",
      "At a White House event shortly after the ruling, Mr. Trump celebrated the judge's order and said \"we didn't want to be held up.\"",
      "\"Who else but in our country would sue to stop a $400 million beautiful ballroom that people have been after for the White House?\" the president said.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:32:13 -0500",
    "summary": "The suspect, Brian Cole, has not yet entered a plea to the charges stemming from two bombs found near Republican and Democratic National Committee headquarters nearly five years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday ordered the Virginia man suspected of leaving two pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic National Committees in 2021 to remain detained in the run-up to a criminal trial.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Matthew Sharbaugh granted the Justice Department's request to keep the suspect, Brian Cole, in custody while he awaits a trial on two criminal counts. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges, which stem from the alleged planting of two improvised explosive devices near the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the RNC and DNC on Jan. 5, 2021, the night before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.",
      "Sharbaugh wrote in a 19-page opinion that \"the government carried its ultimate burden to demonstrate that there are no conditions of release the Court could impose to reasonably assure the safety of the community.\"",
      "The decision came after Cole appeared in court Tuesday for a hearing on whether he should remain detained pending trial.",
      "Justice Department lawyers had argued in a legal filing that Cole poses an \"intolerable risk\" to the community and urged the court to keep him in custody \"considering the extreme and profoundly serious nature of his crimes, the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the years he has spent deceiving those around him to avoid accountability, and the intolerable risk that he will again resort to violence to express his frustration with the world around him.\"",
      "But in arguing for his release, Cole's lawyers said he has lived \"without incident\" in the nearly five years since the bombs were planted and has no criminal history.",
      "His legal team wrote in a filing ahead of the hearing that Cole had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Level 1 is the least severe form\u00a0on the spectrum, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.",
      "The FBI had worked for years to track down the perpetrator who planted the devices on Jan. 5, releasing video footage and photos to the public in hopes of identifying the suspect. The bombs, which did not detonate, were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as local and federal authorities were overwhelmed when a mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.",
      "Cole was arrested last month after investigators looked at cellphone records, purchasing history and vehicle movements. Prosecutors said that during an interview with investigators after his arrest, Cole confessed to constructing the devices, filling them with explosive powder and setting the timers to detonate.",
      "He also said that he had driven to Washington on Jan. 5 to attend a protest over the outcome of the 2020 election and did not tell his family that he was going to a demonstration in support of Mr. Trump, Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing.",
      "During the post-arrest interview, Cole denied any intent to interfere with Congress' certification of the 2020 election results, prosecutors said. Still, Sharbaugh, the magistrate judge, wrote in his opinion that \"the resulting fear and alarm followed all the same \u2014 and how could it not?\"",
      "While Cole's lawyers had noted that the devices did not detonate, and said they believe they would not have, the court called that argument \"decidedly unpersuasive.\"",
      "\"After all, Mr. Cole reportedly stated that he planted the devices \u2014 one of them underneath a public bench, no less \u2014 hoping they would detonate and that there would be news about it. Mercifully, that did not happen,\" Sharbaugh wrote. \"But if the plan had succeeded, the results could have been devas[ta]ting: creating a greater sense of terror on the eve of a high-security Congressional proceeding, causing serious property damage in the heart of Washington, D.C., grievously injuring DNC or RNC staff and other innocent bystanders, or worse.\"",
      "He continued: \"Simply put, the nature and circumstances of the charged offenses here are gravely serious, so this factor points strongly toward pretrial detention.\"",
      "Sharbaugh also found the weight of evidence against Cole to be \"significant,\" citing phone, vehicle and financial records.",
      "Cole faces two criminal offenses, but the magistrate judge put off immediately accepting an indictment returned by a grand jury convened in the District of Columbia Superior Court on Monday. Sharbaugh, who serves in the U.S. district court, said the use of a local grand jury to charge federal crimes raises additional questions. While a different federal judge in Washington\u00a0ruled\u00a0in November that judges must accept indictments for federal offenses returned by local grand juries, he put his decision on hold while an appeals court considers the issue.",
      "Later Friday, Sharbaugh issued an order accepting that two-count indictment returned by the local grand jury, \"on the understanding\" that prosecutors would pursue a new indictment from a federal grand jury when the panels reconvene in the new year.",

      "The event is billed as a memorial march honoring Ashli Babbitt and four others who died on or after Jan. 6. Babbitt, a supporter of President Trump's, was shot and killed by a U.S. Capitol Police officer while a mob attempted to breach the Speaker's Lobby outside the House chamber nearly five years ago. Brian Sicknick, a U.S. Capitol Police officer who died after suffering two strokes after he defended the Capitol during the assault, is also set to be honored.",
      "Among those promoting the march is Enrique Tarrio, the former head of the Proud Boys who was convicted of charges including seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6 attack and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Tarrio was among the more than 1,500 defendants convicted of Jan. 6-related crimes who received clemency from President Trump on his first day back in the White House in January 2025.",
      "Tarrio announced the event on social media, writing on X on Dec. 22 that it will be a \"PATRIOTIC and PEACEFUL march.\"",
      "\"If you have any intention of causing trouble we ask that you stay home. This event will focus on one thing and one thing only\u2026HER memory,\" Tarrio said, referencing Babbitt.",
      "The march is set to begin at 11:45 a.m. at the Ellipse in front of the White House and end at the Capitol, according to Tarrio. The route follows the path that a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters took on Jan. 6 nearly five years ago. The president gave a speech to those gathered at the Ellipse to protest the results of the 2020 election and urged his supporters to march down to the Capitol, where the House and Senate convened to certify the election results.",
      "Mr. Trump told the crowd that they would be \"marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard\" and urged them to \"fight like hell.\"",
      "Also promoting the march is Guy Reffitt, who was a member of the far-right militia group the Texas Three Percenters. He was convicted of five charges stemming from the Capitol attack and sentenced to 87 months in prison before he was pardoned by Mr. Trump.",
      "The march involving Tarrio and Reffitt will be taking place alongside a hearing led by Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson and members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack. Thompson chaired the panel, which concluded its work in late 2022 and recommended that Mr. Trump be prosecuted for his conduct surrounding the riots.",
      "The president faced four criminal charges brought by former special counsel Jack Smith related to his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, but the case was dismissed after he won reelection in 2024.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday that the hearing will examine \"ongoing threats to free and fair elections posed by an out-of-control Trump administration, expose the election deniers who hold high-level positions of significance in the executive branch and detail the threats to public safety posed by the hundreds of violent felons who were pardoned on the President's first day in office.\"",
      "\"In the years since that disgraceful day, far-right Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history and whitewash the events of January 6th. Our country has been indelibly scarred,\" Jeffries, of New York, wrote in a letter to House Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump has downplayed the events of Jan. 6, calling it a \"day of love,\" and defended those who were charged for their conduct during the assault. More than 140 police officers were injured in the Capitol attack.",
      "Video footage from the assault showed Babbitt trying to climb through a broken window as protesters attempted to gain entry into the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers had gathered in the chamber to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election and were evacuated as the mob of demonstrators breached the Capitol building.",
      "Babbitt's family filed a $30 million wrongful death lawsuit against the U.S. government in January 2024, which the Trump administration agreed to settle for $5 million. Many of Mr. Trump's supporters and Capitol rioters have claimed that the police used unnecessary force against those who entered the Capitol on Jan. 6.",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police conducted an internal investigation into the fatal shooting and concluded that the officer involved, Michael Byrd, acted lawfully and within department policy.

      "Chevron Corp. is the only major oil company exporting Venezuelan crude to the U.S. Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves.",

      "President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States and asserted that the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels. The strikes began off Venezuela's Caribbean coast and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zohran-mamdani-inauguration-4-takeaways/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:34:00 -0500",
    "summary": "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani made bold promises for his administration in his first speech.",
    "story": [
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani started the new year with a speech making bold promises for his administration.",
      "At his inauguration on Thursday, Mamdani promised to have the courage and conviction to follow through on his vows to change the culture of City Hall.",
      "Here are four things we learned about Mamdani's plans for the city from his inaugural address.",
      "Mamdani intends to usher in \"a new era\" of politics, embracing democratic socialism",
      "Mamdani made it clear that he is ushering in a new era of city politics that will change the culture inside City Hall and the way government is run. His first speech was all about a government that will cater to the working people, not the rich and powerful.",
      "\"I cannot blame anyone who has come to question the role of government, whose faith in democracy has been eroded by decades of apathy. We will restore that trust by walking a different path, one where government is no longer solely the final recourse for those struggling, but one where excellence is no longer the exception,\" he said.",
      "Before Mamdani got to the mic, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, leaders of the national progressive movement, gave passionate speeches about workers' rights, affordability and the need to eliminate what they call \"the oligarchy.\"",
      "\"New York, thank you for inspiring our nation ... Demanding that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes is not radical. It is exactly the right thing to do,\" Sanders said to his biggest applause.",
      "\"I also ask that we consider today an inauguration for each one of us, too. The nearly 8.5 million New Yorkers who make up the greatest city on Earth,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"Because it is the people of New York City who have chosen historic, ambitious leadership in response to untenable and unprecedented times. New York, we have chosen courage over fear.\"",
      "Mamdani said clearly that the politics of Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders are his, too.",
      "\"Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously,\" he said. \"We may not always succeed, but never will we be accused of lacking the courage to try. To those who insist that the era of big government is over, hear me when I say this. No longer will City Hall hesitate to use its power to improve New Yorkers' lives.\"",
      "Mamdani won't back down on free buses, rent freeze and universal child care",
      "Mamdani's inauguration was unlike those of the past as it was geared toward the city's working class and those who find it hard to make ends meet.",
      "He stood before the crowd of 4,000 in City Hall Plaza, and many more who packed the Canyon of Heroes, on a bitterly cold day and reaffirmed his promises for free buses, a rent freeze and universal child care.",
      "\"We will transform the culture of City Hall from one of no to one of how,\" he said.",
      "Mamdani is the city's first Muslim mayor and, at 34, its youngest in over 100 years. He said he would be true to the values that got him elected.",
      "\"I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist,\" the 112th mayor said.",
      "It's not going to be easy, however, because Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was in the audience, will be the key to his success.",
      "Hochul faces a tough reelection campaign and her Republican opponent will be looking to criticize her for anything she does to help the mayor succeed.",
      "Mamdani will not ignore those who voted against him",
      "In his speech, Mamdani acknowledged his supporters and those who opposed him in the election. He said he stands with those who voted for him and, \"I stand just as resolutely alongside those who did not.\"",
      "\"I know there are some who view this administration with distrust or disdain, or who see politics as permanently broken,\" Mamdani said. \"And while only action can change minds, I promise you this: If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.\"",
      "Mamdani has been under fire from many Jewish New Yorkers for refusing to say that Israel should be a Jewish state. But he appeared to offer an olive branch during his speech, or at least attempt to say he comes from the same place they do.",
      "\"Where else could a Muslim kid like me grow up eating bagels and lox every Sunday?\" Mamdani said.",
      "He also offered praise for his predecessor, Eric Adams, who he clashed with repeatedly.",
      "\"He and I have had our share of disagreements, but I will always be touched that he chose me as the mayoral candidate that he would most want to be trapped on an elevator with,\" Mamdani said.",
      "Mamdani will use his fame to push his agenda",
      "Many in the crowd were volunteers during Mamdani's march to victory, wearing blue and yellow hats with \"Zohran\" emblazoned on the front.",
      "A come-from-behind victory in the primary helped Mamdani become an international sensation. As mayor, he made it clear that he intends to use his fame to get his agenda accomplished.",
      "\"What we achieve together will reach across the five boroughs and it will resonate far beyond,\" he said. \"There are many who will be watching. They want to know if the left can govern. They want to know if the struggles that afflict them can be solved. They want to know if it is right to hope again. So standing together with the wind of purpose at our backs, we will do something that New Yorkers do better than anyone else: We will set an example for the world.\"",
      "He added, \"If what Sinatra said is true, let us prove that anyone can make it in New York, and anywhere else, too.\"",
      "\"Let us prove that when a city belongs to the people, there is no need too small to be met, no person too sick to be made healthy, no one too alone to feel like New York is their home,\" he said. \"The world continues, the work endures, the work, my friends, has only just begun.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minnesota-day-care-fraud-warning-records/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:23:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Audits completed in the past 10 years show that Minnesota has lacked the teeth to properly vet attendance records and go after possible fraudsters proactively.",
    "story": [
      "A viral video has put a national spotlight\u00a0on Minnesota's child care network as allegations of widespread fraud swirl. Records show Minnesota has been trying to improve oversight of the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) payment system for more than a decade.",
      "The day after Christmas, YouTuber Nick Shirley released a video accusing nearly a dozen child care centers of taking government assistance without actually providing a service in Minneapolis. The video primarily features him and a man only referred to as \"David\" going to various centers, demanding entry or information, then stating that the center was empty.",
      "Shirley's central claim is that each day care is billing the CCAP for children who are not really there; WCCO found the video's broad claims are not proven.",
      "While federal and state investigators are now looking into each of the centers featured by Shirley, audits completed in the past 10 years show that Minnesota has lacked the teeth to properly vet attendance records and go after possible fraudsters proactively.",
      "In May of 2025, the federal Office of the Inspector General released an audit of 200 randomly selected child care assistance payments from 2023. The agency found that in 38 instances, \"Minnesota did not comply with requirements related to attendance and payment for services.\" The auditors extrapolated that to mean that the state was making at least one error in 11% of payments made to 1,155 centers in 2023.",
      "\"Minnesota's limited oversight of attendance documentation at childcare centers resulted in overpayments to providers,\" the audit states. \"A lack of oversight to ensure accurate and complete attendance documentation could increase the risk of fraud, waste and abuse to the CCAP program.\"",
      "The Office of the Inspector General   made recommendations, including \"strengthening its monitoring program to include routine reviews of CCAP attendance records for accuracy.\"",
      "In a response included in the audit, the Department of Health and Human Services agreed with this recommendation and others. DHS wrote that it is expanding what's called the Early and Often Program, which \"aims to ensure that new child care centers meet the requirements of CCAP by increased monitoring of their attendance record-keeping practices and compliance with state statutes.\"",
      "Months prior, in January 2025, Department of Children, Youth and Families Commissioner Tikki Brown acknowledged there are gaps in their fraud detection system when it comes to accurate attendance numbers.",
      "\"We certainly need to investigate that more thoroughly to ensure that agencies do have as broad authority as possible to investigate fraud and act on all aspects of fraud. I don't know that that's fully present,\" Brown said.",
      "In 2019, a report by the Office of the Legislative Auditor showed that the Minnesota Department of Human Services established an investigatory team to go after child care providers suspected of fraud in 2013. The office reviewed explosive claims of fraud from 2013 to 2018, ultimately finding that prosecutors were able to \"prove\" between $5 to $6 million worth of fraud in those years.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesotans were charged in state and federal cases, but not everyone was convicted. The OLA could not provide an exact estimate, but the agency believed that the true extent of the fraud was greater than the $6 million figure. The OLA spoke to prosecutors who said that there were sometimes issues with the quality of evidence gathered by DHS.",
      "The OLA stated in this audit that the review had a \"limited scope ... We did not evaluate CCAP, nor did we fully assess the state's efforts to prevent, detect, and investigate CCAP fraud.\"",
      "Consistent across both reports is the recommendation to install electronic attendance gathering tools to ensure that numbers are recorded in real time, reducing the ability for centers to report false numbers.",
      "At a rally designed to push back on the Trump administration's decision to freeze all federal CCAP payments this week, DFL Rep. Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn said that those systems would be up and running this summer.",
      "At that same rally, providers scoffed at the idea that the current system is simple to defraud. Maria Snyder, a St. Paul area provider, said that she is consistently getting surprise visits and audits from state inspectors who rigorously check her attendance records. She said that you can get citations on complete technicalities.",
      "\"Imagine my surprise at this narrative that it's so easy to scam child care assistance,\" Snyder said.",
      "At a February 2025 meeting of the House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Policy Committee, officials said that DHS has a team of four investigators who look into CCAP.",
      "Since 2020, the team has recovered about $2.4 million, referring on average five cases annually for criminal investigations since 2021. During the same time frame, DHS has stopped payments to 79 CCAP providers, according to the committee.",
      "CBS News found that of the day cares that Shirley visited, all but two are licensed. State inspectors visited each of the licensed centers within the past six months, issuing citations related to violations like safety and staff training, but not fraud.",
      "Inspectors with the federal Department of Homeland Security and the state visited each of the day cares in Shirley's video.",
      "One of the day cares, which\u00a0showed WCCO security footage\u00a0that owners said proves children were present the day Shirley was there, said that DHS asked for two months' worth of attendance records. The results of these two investigations are not yet public.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 20:46:02 -0500",
    "summary": "\"In retrospect, it's too bad I took it because it gave them a little ammunition,\" President Trump told The Wall Street Journal.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he underwent a CT scan, rather than an MRI, during his October examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a new interview, he also says it would have been better if he hadn't undergone the scan at all.",
      "\"In retrospect, it's too bad I took it because it gave them a little ammunition,\" the president said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday. \"I would have been a lot better off if they didn't, because the fact that I took it said, 'Oh gee, is something wrong?' Well, nothing's wrong.\"",
      "In late October, Mr. Trump told reporters he underwent an MRI yielding \"perfect\" results during his examination that month. The White House said in December that \"advanced imaging\" was performed to check his \"cardiovascular and abdominal health.\"",
      "But the president told The Wall Street Journal it was actually a CT scan, and his doctor, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, confirmed that in a statement to CBS News.",
      "CT scans and MRIs are common imaging tests that help doctors see inside the body and diagnose a wide range of conditions. CT scans use a series of X-ray pictures to create a 3D image, typically allowing doctors to identify things like blood clots. An MRI takes longer and uses magnetic and radio waves to produce more detailed images of organs and soft tissue than CT scans.",
      "\"President Trump agreed to meet with the staff and soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in October,\" Barbabella said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday. \"In order to make the most of the president's time at the hospital, we recommended he undergo another routine physical evaluation to ensure continued optimal health. As part of that examination, we asked the president if he would undergo advanced imaging \u2014 either an MRI or CT Scan \u2014 to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues. The president agreed, and our team of consultants performed a CT Scan. As we revealed in the post-examination report, the advanced imaging was perfectly normal and revealed absolutely no abnormalities.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House and Mr. Trump's doctors have always maintained he received advanced imaging.",
      "\"Additional details on the imaging have been disclosed by the president himself, because he continues to be the most transparent and open president in history and has nothing to hide, unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, who hid from the press and lied about his clear physical and mental decline,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The president also told the newspaper he doesn't want to lower his daily aspirin dose, something he's used as a blood thinner for over two decades. \"I'm a little superstitious,\" he said.",
      "\"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,\" Mr. Trump told the Journal. \"I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?\"",
      "Mr. Trump, 79, isn't a fan of traditional exercise outside of his favorite pastime, golf.",
      "\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Mr. Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"",
      "Over the summer, the White House announced the president had been diagnosed with a \"benign and common\" vein condition known as chronic venous insufficiency after he noticed swelling in his legs. Barbabella said the examination revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.",
      "The president has at times displayed visible bruises on his hands, which the White House has attributed to frequent handshaking.",
      "\"This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,\" Barbabella said in a memo over the summer.",
      "Ed  O'Keefe and \n                                                  \n                      Kristin  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "\"The U.S. Coast Guard is coordinating search-and-rescue operations with vessels in the area, and a Coast Guard C-130 aircraft is en route to provide further search coverage with the ability to drop a survival raft and supplies,\" the statement said.",
      "As many as eight people abandoned the remaining two vessels, three U.S. officials told CBS News. One of the officials said the strikes were conducted in the eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "A 46-second video of the strikes did not appear to show any survivors in the water.",
      "The U.S. military also said it conducted strikes Wednesday on two vessels, killing five people, Southern Command said later in the day, bringing the estimated death toll in the monthslong military campaign against alleged drug smugglers to at least 115.",

      "The Trump administration's handling of survivors has come under intense scrutiny, with some critics accusing it of committing potential war crimes after a follow-up strike on Sept. 2 killed two survivors. Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean Sea on Oct. 16 were detained by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin, prompting questions about the danger the Trump administration has claimed alleged drug traffickers pose to the U.S. Strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, who has since been presumed dead.",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 have sought to rein in the boat strikes, which come as the Trump administration escalates pressure against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The administration has accused Maduro of drug trafficking and working with gangs designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations, which Maduro denies.",
      "Lawmakers have raised the alarm that the strikes, which have not been authorized by Congress, could lead to war with Venezuela and have questioned their legality.",
      "President Trump, who has repeatedly threatened land strikes against Venezuela,\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" last week linked to the alleged drug smuggling operations, but his administration has provided few details on the matter.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:00:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "summary": "2025 was the third hottest year on record and pushed Earth past a critical climate change mark, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming.

      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",
      "According to the job posting, a qualified applicant would have \"deep technical expertise in machine learning, AI safety, evaluations, security or adjacent risk domains\" and have experience with \"designing or executing high-rigor evaluations for complex technical systems,\" among other qualifications.",

Bondi said Maduro and his wife \"will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.\"",

Later Saturday morning, Bondi shared a superseding indictment.",
      "The indictment, prepared by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, accuses Maduro of conspiracy to commit narcoterrorism and to import cocaine, and of possessing and conspiring to possess \"Machineguns and Destructive Devices.\" The charges appear to be the same as a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",

He was trying to get into it but he got bum-rushed so fast that he didn't get into that. We were prepared, we had, you know, massive blow torches and everything else that you need to get through that steel, but we didn't need it. He didn't make it to that area of the house.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said Maduro and his wife had been flown out of Venezuela, but did not say where the pair were. Venezuelan officials have called for proof of life. The U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special forces unit, carried out the operation to capture them, officials told CBS News. The Trump administration notified Congressional leaders about the operation only after it began, Congressional sources told CBS News.",
      "Maduro, 63, has led Venezuela since 2013. His most recent election was disputed by international observers and the U.S.\u00a0recognized\u00a0opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner. The U.S. imposed sanctions against election officials for allegedly rigging the outcome, but Maduro was still\u00a0sworn in\u00a0for a third term in January.",

The Trump administration designated the group as a\u00a0foreign terrorist organization\u00a0last year, though experts have\u00a0questioned that characterization.

      "Senate Intelligence Chair Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said he spoke with Rubio and that Venezuela's interim government \"must now decide whether to continue the drug trafficking and colluding with adversaries like Iran and Cuba or whether to act like a normal nation and return to the civilized world.\"",
      "\"I urge them to choose wisely,\" he said.",
      "Utah Sen. Mike Lee said that he also spoke with Rubio, who said that Maduro would be brought to the U.S. Lee also said that Rubio \"anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in U.S. custody.\"",
      "Lee added that the operation \"likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" but did not offer any other details.",
      "Vice President JD Vance praised the \"brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.\"",
      "\"Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says,\" Vance said. The vice president highlighted Maduro's previous indictments as justification for the operation.",
      "\"You don't get to avoid justice for drug trafficking the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas,\" he said.",
      "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, released a statement calling Maduro's capture \"an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.\" He said he spoke to Rubio on Saturday morning and was looking forward to further briefings when the Senate returns next week.",
      "House Intelligence Chair Rick Crawford, a Republican from Arkansas, drew comparisons to the arrest of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in 1990.",
      "\"This is a historic day in the Western Hemisphere, 36 years after the capture of Manuel Noriega, when the U.S showed we will not allow cartels to take over countries in our shared neighborhood. The arrest of Cartel De Los Soles leader Nicolas Maduro shows this clearly,\" Crawford said. \"Venezuela could never start the road back to the great nation it once was until Maduro was out of the way. I call upon the Venezuelan people to reclaim their freedom.\"",

      "Democrat lawmakers criticized the Trump administration for acting unilaterally.",
      "House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, called Maduro \"an illegitimate ruler\" but said he had \"seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos.\"",
      "\"The Administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region and its legal justification for this decision,\" Himes said.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the operation an \"unauthorized military attack\" and a \"sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "\"That history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to make the claim with a straight face that other countries should respect the United States' sovereignty when we do not do the same,\" Kaine said.",
      "He said that his bipartisan resolution stipulating the U.S. not enter war with Venezuela without a clear Congressional authorization will be up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Where will this go next? Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?\" Kaine said. \"Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people's elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk. It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade ... We've entered the 250th year of American democracy and cannot allow it to devolve into the tyranny that our founders fought to escape.\"",
      "Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, said that Mr. Trump \"rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.\" Kim also accused Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of lying to Congress when they met with leaders last month about fatal strikes on alleged drug vessels and said the Trump administration's goal was not regime change.",
      "\"Without authorization from Congress, and with the vast majority of Americans opposed to military action, Trump just launched an unjustified, illegal strike on Venezuela,\" said Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern.",
      "Florida residents cheer operation",
      "South Florida, which is home to a large population of Venezuelans, saw celebrations early Saturday. People hugged, sang the U.S. and Venezuelan national anthems, and waved flags outside the community gathering spot El Arepazo.",
      "\"President Trump has changed the course of history in our hemisphere. Our country & the world are safer for it,\" said Florida Republican Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez. \"Today's decisive action is this hemisphere's equivalent to the Fall of the Berlin Wall. It's a big day in Florida, where the majority of Venezuelan, Cuban, & Nicaraguan exiles reside. This is the community I represent & we are overwhelmed with emotion and hope.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and his wife early Saturday morning, 36 years to the day after U.S. forces arrested another indicted Latin American leader.",
      "A one-time U.S. ally and CIA informant, Manuel Noriega led Panama for much of the 1980s.",
      "He was raised in the slums of Panama City and rose to prominence under Gen. Omar Torrijos, who seized power in a 1968 coup. After Torrijos was killed in a 1983 plane crash, Noriega took control of the Panamanian government. He was propped up by U.S. officials, who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight drug trafficking.",
      "Noriega spent years on the CIA's payroll, assisting U.S. interests throughout Latin America and acting as a liaison to Cuba's Fidel Castro. Former U.S. officials testified that Noriega's assistance was crucial to advancing foreign policy interests in South America during that time.",
      "Noriega fell out of favor with Washington due to his demands for independence and allegations that he was accepting bribes to allow drugs into the U.S. in the late 1980s. Former President George H.W. Bush ordered the U.S. military to invade Panama in late 1989, sending 24,000 troops to topple Noriega's government. The operation left 23 American soldiers dead and hundreds more injured.",
      "Noriega hid out in the Vatican embassy before surrendering to U.S. authorities on January 3, 1990. He was taken to the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges. His fall led to the end of Panama's military dictatorship.",
      "Noriega was convicted on drug trafficking charges and spent 20 years in an American prison. He was\u00a0extradited to France\u00a0in 2010 to serve a seven-year money laundering sentence. In 2011, he was\u00a0sent to Panama\u00a0to complete a 60-year sentence for murder, corruption and embezzlement during the military's three-decade rule.",
      "In 2015, Noriega gave his first interview in nearly 20 years from his Panamanian prison. He called himself \"the last general of the military era\" and apologized to those \"offended, affected, injured or humiliated\" by his own actions or those of his superiors and subordinates during the military regime.",
      "Noriega died after complications from a surgery to remove a benign brain tumor in 2017. He was 83. Juan Carlos Varela, Panama's president at the time, said that his death \"closes a chapter in our history.\"",
      "House Intelligence Chair Rep. Rick Crawford commented on the connection between Noriega's capture and the operation in Venezuela in a statement shared on social media.",
      "\"This is a historic day in the Western Hemisphere, 36 years after the capture of Manuel Noriega, when the U.S showed we will not allow cartels to take over countries in our shared neighborhood. The arrest of Cartel De Los Soles leader Nicolas Maduro shows this clearly,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Crawford, a Republican from Arkansas. \"Venezuela could never start the road back to the great nation it once was until Maduro was out of the way. I call upon the Venezuelan people to reclaim their freedom.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 19:57:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The FBI's field office in Charlotte, North Carolina, said the potential attack was inspired by ISIS.",
    "story": [
      "A potential New Year's Eve terror attack inspired by ISIS was thwarted in North Carolina, authorities announced Friday. A suspect is in custody, accused of planning to attack a grocery store and a fast food restaurant in the town of Mint Hill, which is located near Charlotte.",
      "The 18-year-old suspect, identified as Christian Sturdivant, had been planning the attack for about a year, U.S. Attorney Russ Ferguson said at a news conference.",
      "He allegedly planned to use knives and hammers in the attack. When the FBI executed a search warrant at the suspect's home, investigators found those weapons hidden under his bed and notes detailing his alleged plans for the attack, Ferguson said.",
      "The notes indicated that the suspect wanted to target \"Jews, Christians and LGBTQ individuals,\" Ferguson said. According to an affidavit from an FBI agent filed in court, the suspect's grandfather, who is his legal guardian, is a Christian minister in Charlotte and works at a grocery store.",
      "FBI Special Agent James Barnacle Jr., head of the bureau's field office in North Carolina, said the suspect, who is a U.S. citizen, was monitoring multiple grocery stores in Mint Hill to try to determine which one would be the most crowded on New Year's Eve.",
      "\"He knew there would be a lot of people there grocery shopping,\" Barnacle said. He also said the suspect \"was looking for a high-profile place.\"",
      "The field office said\u00a0the suspect was \"directly inspired\" by ISIS. Investigators believe he was working alone, Ferguson said.",
      "According to investigators, the suspect spoke about his plans for the attack with an undercover FBI agent who he thought was involved with ISIS.",
      "\"He was preparing for jihad, and innocent people were going to die,\" Ferguson said.",
      "The suspect had allegedly reached out earlier to someone he thought was a member of ISIS but was actually an undercover agent with the New York Police Department. The suspect allegedly pledged allegiance to ISIS and told the undercover agent he planned to \"do jihad soon,\" Ferguson said.",
      "The suspect worked at a Burger King, but the U.S. attorney didn't say whether that restaurant was a target of the alleged plot.",
      "Barnacle said Sturdivant first came on the FBI's radar in January 2022 when he was allegedly in contact over social media with an unidentified ISIS member who told him to dress in black, knock on people's doors and attack them with a hammer, Barnacle said.",
      "Following that alleged conversation, the suspect left his home dressed in black apparently intending to kill one of his neighbors with a hammer and knife, according to the FBI agent's affidavit. The suspect's grandfather was able to restrain his grandson and bring him back into the home, according to the affidavit.",
      "No charges were filed in that incident, and the suspect underwent psychological care, Barnacle said. The FBI closed its investigation into the teen when he started receiving treatment.",
      "Asked why the suspect wasn't charged in the earlier incident, Ferguson stressed that he was a 14-year-old juvenile at the time. \"I do think we're very fortunate he was 18 now because it makes it a whole lot easier to bring charges,\" he said.",
      "The FBI was told he no longer had access to social media, but the Charlotte field office learned last month he was back on social media, Barnacle said. The suspect was identified as the alleged holder of a TikTok account with multiple posts in support of ISIS.",
      "The suspect's grandparents didn't appear to know about the social media posts, Ferguson said. However, the suspect's grandfather attempted to secure the knives and hammers in the home so the suspect couldn't access them.",
      "The FBI attempted to have the suspect involuntarily committed for medical attention Monday night, but a state magistrate denied the request, Ferguson said. Barnacle said the FBI arrested him on New Year's Eve as he was being released from a local medical facility.",
      "Sturdivant made his initial appearance in federal court Friday morning, Ferguson said. He has been charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and faces a potential maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

    "story": [
      "Diane Crump, who in 1969 became the first woman to ride professionally in a horse race and a year later became the first female jockey in the Kentucky Derby, has died. She was 77.",
      "Crump was diagnosed in October with an aggressive form of brain cancer and died Thursday night in hospice care in Winchester, Virginia, her daughter, Della Payne, told The Associated Press.",
      "Crump went on to\u00a0win 228 races\u00a0before riding her last race in 1998, a month shy of her 50th birthday and nearly 30 years after her trailblazing ride at Hialeah Park in Florida on Feb. 7, 1969.",
      "Crump was among several women to fight successfully at the time to be granted a jockey license, but they still needed a trainer willing to put them in a race and then for the race to run. Others were thwarted when male jockeys boycotted or threatened to boycott if a woman was riding.",
      "Photographs of Crump's walk to the saddling area at Hialeah show her protected by security guards as a crowd pressed in on all sides. Six of the original 12 jockeys in the race had refused to ride, Mark Shrager wrote in his biography, \"Diane Crump: A Horse Racing Pioneer's Life in the Saddle.\" Among them were future legends Angel Cordero Jr., Jorge Velasquez and Ron Turcotte, who four years later would ride Secretariat to win the Triple Crown.",
      "But other jockeys stepped up, and as the 12 horses made their way onto the track, the bugler skipped the traditional call to the post and instead played \"Smile for Me, My Diane.\" Crump, on a 50-1 longshot called Bridle 'n Bit, finished 10th, but the barrier had been broken. A month later, Bridle 'n Bit gave Crump her first victory at Gulfstream Park.",
      "She again made history in 1970 by becoming the first woman to ride in the Kentucky Derby. She won the first race that day at Churchill Downs, but again her mount for the history-making race was outclassed. She finished 15th out of 17 on Fathom.",
      "It would be 14 more years before another female jockey would ride in the Derby, with only four more to follow in the decades since.",
      "The racetrack president at Churchill Downs, Mike Anderson, said in a statement on Friday that Crump \"will be forever respected and fondly remembered in horse racing lore.\"",
      "He noted that Crump, who had been riding since age 5 and galloping young Thoroughbreds since she was a teenager, \"was an iconic trailblazer who admirably fulfilled her childhood dreams.\"",
      "Chris Goodlett, of the Kentucky Derby Museum, said \"Diane Crump's name stands for courage, grit, and progress.\" He added: \"Her determination in the face of overwhelming odds opened doors for generations of female jockeys and inspired countless others far beyond racing.\"",
      "After retiring from racing, Crump settled in Virginia and started a business helping people buy and sell horses.",
      "In later years, she took her therapy dogs, all Dachshunds, to visit patients in hospitals and other medical clinics. Some with chronic illnesses she visited regularly for years.",
      "Payne said when her mother went into assisted living a month ago, she was already \"quasi-famous\" in the medical center because of how much time she had spent there, and a \"steady stream\" of doctors and nurses came to see her. One of the last people to visit her was the man who mowed her lawn.",
      "Her daughter said Crump would never take \"no\" for an answer, whether it was becoming a jockey or helping someone in need.",
      "\"I wouldn't say she was as competitive as she was stubborn,\" Payne said. \"If someone was counting on her, she could never let someone down.\"",
      "Late in life, Crump's mottos were literally tattooed on her forearms: \"Kindness\" on the left, \"Compassion\" on the right.",
      "Crump will be cremated and her ashes interred between her parents in Prospect Hill Cemetery in Front Royal, Virginia.",

      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming. Without strong safeguards and independent detection, manipulated media can \u2014and will \u2014 be weaponized,\" Copyleaks said in a blog post.",

      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

    "summary": "Stefon Diggs, the New England Patriots' wide receiver, spoke to the media for the first time since it was revealed he is facing criminal charges.",
    "story": [
      "Stefon Diggs, the New England Patriots' star wide receiver, spoke to the media for the first time on Friday since it was revealed he is facing criminal charges stemming from a Dec. 2 incident with a personal chef in Dedham, Massachusetts.",
      "Speaking in the Patriots locker room, Diggs apologized to reporters for being unavailable the past few days and said it's been a \"very emotional time.\"",
      "\"It's definitely an open case so I can't even say anything about it,\" Diggs said.",
      "He said he would only be able to answer questions about football.",
      "\"I'm going to continue to be the guy I've been. Try to finish the season strong,\" Diggs said. \"We all deal with life stuff, family stuff ... being a football team is hard. You band together, you lean on your brothers, you lean on your people that you spend the most time with.\"",
      "Charges against Stefon Diggs",
      "Diggs is charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery, according to court paperwork. He has denied the allegations through his attorney, and the team said in a statement, \"We support Stefon.\"",
      "According to a Dedham police report, the personal chef said she had been having an ongoing text message exchange with Diggs about money she said he owed her. The woman said she was hired as Diggs' personal chef for the entire football season and was staying in a room at his Massachusetts home.",
      "The woman alleges that there was a confrontation on Dec. 2 over money.",
      "\"She said that they began to discuss this, which apparently angered the male,\" police said in the report. \"She alleges that the male then smacked her across the face. She said that she tried to push him away. The male then tried to choke her using the crook of his elbow around her neck.\"",
      "The woman told police she had trouble breathing. A police report said she didn't take any photographs to document alleged injuries.",
      "Stefon Diggs denies allegations",
      "\"\ufeffStefon Diggs categorically denies these allegations. They are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated, and were never investigated -- because they did not occur,\" attorney David Meier said. \"The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: they are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee's satisfaction. Stefon looks forward to establishing the truth in a court of law.\"",
      "Diggs' arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 23, which would be two days before the AFC Championship Game.",
      "The 13-3 Patriots are set to play the Miami Dolphins in Foxboro on Sunday for their final regular season game before the playoffs, with a chance to claim the top seed in the AFC if they win and the Denver Broncos lose.",
      "Allegations against Christian Barmore",
      "Christian Barmore, a defensive tackle with the Patriots, is also facing domestic assault charges in a separate incident that happened in August. Barmore has been charged with one count of assault and battery on a \"family/household member,\" after allegedly throwing his pregnant girlfriend to the floor, according to a Mansfield Police report. Barmore and the woman share another child together and have been together for three years, the report said.",
      "The girlfriend said the incident began because the air conditioner was set to 70 degrees instead of 68, as Barmore wanted. Throughout the day, the girlfriend allegedly avoided Barmore \"as she knew he was in a bad mood,\" the report said. Later in the day, while she was on the phone with her mother, Barmore allegedly took the phone and ended the call. The woman explained that she went to the front of the home to call for help when Barmore then allegedly grabbed her and threw her to the floor, and when she attempted to get up, he \"grabbed her by the shirt in the area of her neck,\" the report said.",
      "The woman eventually got her phone back and called a car service to get a ride to Delaware with their child. The police report said that the girlfriend received bruises after she was \"thrown to the floor\" and included them in the filing.",
      "Barmore refused to speak to the media about the allegations in the locker room on Friday.",
      "\"I'm focused on Miami, playing football,\" Barmore said.",
      "Attorney David Meier, who is also representing Barmore alongside Diggs, released a statement about the charges on Wednesday.",
      "\"We are confident that the evidence will demonstrate that no criminal conduct took place. Based on the facts and the law, we expect that this personal matter will be resolved in the near future and both parties will move forward together.\"",
      "Barmore will be arraigned on February 3, 2026.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",
      "BusinessesSecurities such as stocks and bondsArtCollectiblesIntellectual property",
      "Businesses",
      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax. He had previously resided in San Francisco.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:32:13 -0500",
    "summary": "The suspect, Brian Cole, has not yet entered a plea to the charges stemming from two bombs found near Republican and Democratic National Committee headquarters nearly five years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday ordered the Virginia man suspected of leaving two pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic National Committees in 2021 to remain detained in the run-up to a criminal trial.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Matthew Sharbaugh granted the Justice Department's request to keep the suspect, Brian Cole, in custody while he awaits a trial on two criminal counts. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges, which stem from the alleged planting of two improvised explosive devices near the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the RNC and DNC on Jan. 5, 2021, the night before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.",
      "Sharbaugh wrote in a 19-page opinion that \"the government carried its ultimate burden to demonstrate that there are no conditions of release the Court could impose to reasonably assure the safety of the community.\"",
      "The decision came after Cole appeared in court Tuesday for a hearing on whether he should remain detained pending trial.",
      "Justice Department lawyers had argued in a legal filing that Cole poses an \"intolerable risk\" to the community and urged the court to keep him in custody \"considering the extreme and profoundly serious nature of his crimes, the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the years he has spent deceiving those around him to avoid accountability, and the intolerable risk that he will again resort to violence to express his frustration with the world around him.\"",
      "But in arguing for his release, Cole's lawyers said he has lived \"without incident\" in the nearly five years since the bombs were planted and has no criminal history.",
      "His legal team wrote in a filing ahead of the hearing that Cole had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Level 1 is the least severe form\u00a0on the spectrum, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.",
      "The FBI had worked for years to track down the perpetrator who planted the devices on Jan. 5, releasing video footage and photos to the public in hopes of identifying the suspect. The bombs, which did not detonate, were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as local and federal authorities were overwhelmed when a mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.",
      "Cole was arrested last month after investigators looked at cellphone records, purchasing history and vehicle movements. Prosecutors said that during an interview with investigators after his arrest, Cole confessed to constructing the devices, filling them with explosive powder and setting the timers to detonate.",
      "He also said that he had driven to Washington on Jan. 5 to attend a protest over the outcome of the 2020 election and did not tell his family that he was going to a demonstration in support of Mr. Trump, Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing.",
      "During the post-arrest interview, Cole denied any intent to interfere with Congress' certification of the 2020 election results, prosecutors said. Still, Sharbaugh, the magistrate judge, wrote in his opinion that \"the resulting fear and alarm followed all the same \u2014 and how could it not?\"",
      "While Cole's lawyers had noted that the devices did not detonate, and said they believe they would not have, the court called that argument \"decidedly unpersuasive.\"",
      "\"After all, Mr. Cole reportedly stated that he planted the devices \u2014 one of them underneath a public bench, no less \u2014 hoping they would detonate and that there would be news about it. Mercifully, that did not happen,\" Sharbaugh wrote. \"But if the plan had succeeded, the results could have been devas[ta]ting: creating a greater sense of terror on the eve of a high-security Congressional proceeding, causing serious property damage in the heart of Washington, D.C., grievously injuring DNC or RNC staff and other innocent bystanders, or worse.\"",
      "He continued: \"Simply put, the nature and circumstances of the charged offenses here are gravely serious, so this factor points strongly toward pretrial detention.\"",
      "Sharbaugh also found the weight of evidence against Cole to be \"significant,\" citing phone, vehicle and financial records.",
      "Cole faces two criminal offenses, but the magistrate judge put off immediately accepting an indictment returned by a grand jury convened in the District of Columbia Superior Court on Monday. Sharbaugh, who serves in the U.S. district court, said the use of a local grand jury to charge federal crimes raises additional questions. While a different federal judge in Washington\u00a0ruled\u00a0in November that judges must accept indictments for federal offenses returned by local grand juries, he put his decision on hold while an appeals court considers the issue.",
      "Later Friday, Sharbaugh issued an order accepting that two-count indictment returned by the local grand jury, \"on the understanding\" that prosecutors would pursue a new indictment from a federal grand jury when the panels reconvene in the new year.",

    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies and served as vice chairman of Berkshire's board of directors.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

    "summary": "House Democrats will also be holding a hearing on the five-year mark of the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The former leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys and other defendants convicted for crimes connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol are set to return to Washington, D.C., for a march marking five years since the attack.",
      "The event is billed as a memorial march honoring Ashli Babbitt and four others who died on or after Jan. 6. Babbitt, a supporter of President Trump's, was shot and killed by a U.S. Capitol Police officer while a mob attempted to breach the Speaker's Lobby outside the House chamber nearly five years ago. Brian Sicknick, a U.S. Capitol Police officer who died after suffering two strokes after he defended the Capitol during the assault, is also set to be honored.",
      "Among those promoting the march is Enrique Tarrio, the former head of the Proud Boys who was convicted of charges including seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6 attack and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Tarrio was among the more than 1,500 defendants convicted of Jan. 6-related crimes who received clemency from President Trump on his first day back in the White House in January 2025.",
      "Tarrio announced the event on social media, writing on X on Dec. 22 that it will be a \"PATRIOTIC and PEACEFUL march.\"",
      "\"If you have any intention of causing trouble we ask that you stay home. This event will focus on one thing and one thing only\u2026HER memory,\" Tarrio said, referencing Babbitt.",
      "The march is set to begin at 11:45 a.m. at the Ellipse in front of the White House and end at the Capitol, according to Tarrio. The route follows the path that a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters took on Jan. 6 nearly five years ago. The president gave a speech to those gathered at the Ellipse to protest the results of the 2020 election and urged his supporters to march down to the Capitol, where the House and Senate convened to certify the election results.",
      "Mr. Trump told the crowd that they would be \"marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard\" and urged them to \"fight like hell.\"",
      "Also promoting the march is Guy Reffitt, who was a member of the far-right militia group the Texas Three Percenters. He was convicted of five charges stemming from the Capitol attack and sentenced to 87 months in prison before he was pardoned by Mr. Trump.",
      "The march involving Tarrio and Reffitt will be taking place alongside a hearing led by Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson and members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack. Thompson chaired the panel, which concluded its work in late 2022 and recommended that Mr. Trump be prosecuted for his conduct surrounding the riots.",
      "The president faced four criminal charges brought by former special counsel Jack Smith related to his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, but the case was dismissed after he won reelection in 2024.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday that the hearing will examine \"ongoing threats to free and fair elections posed by an out-of-control Trump administration, expose the election deniers who hold high-level positions of significance in the executive branch and detail the threats to public safety posed by the hundreds of violent felons who were pardoned on the President's first day in office.\"",
      "\"In the years since that disgraceful day, far-right Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history and whitewash the events of January 6th. Our country has been indelibly scarred,\" Jeffries, of New York, wrote in a letter to House Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump has downplayed the events of Jan. 6, calling it a \"day of love,\" and defended those who were charged for their conduct during the assault. More than 140 police officers were injured in the Capitol attack.",
      "Video footage from the assault showed Babbitt trying to climb through a broken window as protesters attempted to gain entry into the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers had gathered in the chamber to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election and were evacuated as the mob of demonstrators breached the Capitol building.",
      "Babbitt's family filed a $30 million wrongful death lawsuit against the U.S. government in January 2024, which the Trump administration agreed to settle for $5 million. Many of Mr. Trump's supporters and Capitol rioters have claimed that the police used unnecessary force against those who entered the Capitol on Jan. 6.",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police conducted an internal investigation into the fatal shooting and concluded that the officer involved, Michael Byrd, acted lawfully and within department policy. The department said he potentially saved members of Congress and staff from \"serious injury and possible death\" from the rioters who had forced their way into the Capitol.",

    "summary": "A look at bar and nightclub fires in the United States with significant death tolls and similar risks that led to the tragedies.",
    "story": [
      "A blaze at a packed bar in the Swiss Alps during New Year's Eve celebrations killed about 40 people and injured 115 others, many of them seriously.",
      "Cellphone video captured harrowing images of the tragedy's first moments as flames swept across the wooden ceiling of the bar's basement level, panicking partygoers who rushed to escape. The fire then rose up and engulfed the upper level.",
      "Investigators said Friday that the blaze appears to have been started by sparklers on Champagne bottles, which ignited the bar's ceiling.",
      "\"From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread conflagration ensued,\" prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said a news conference.",
      "Several witnesses had described seeing bottles with sparklers or candles held aloft that set the ceiling alight. The flames spread rapidly, causing the ceiling to collapse, said two women interviewed by French broadcaster BFMTV.",
      "\"In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood,\" one of them said.",
      "One of the women described a crowd surge as people frantically tried to escape from a basement nightclub up a flight of stairs and through a narrow door, noting that there were \"about 200 people trying to get out within 30 seconds through some very narrow steps,\" according to a BBC News translation.",
      "Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris who survived the blaze, said he hadn't seen the fire start, but did see waitresses arrive with Champagne bottles with sparklers.",
      "He described \"total chaos\" inside the bar. One of his friends died and \"two or three were missing,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "In the early stages of the investigation, Valais Canton Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said it was \"totally unknown\" how many people were inside the bar when the fire broke out, but said authorities would be looking into its maximum capacity.",
      "The disaster echoed some past tragedies when deadly bar and nightclub fires broke out in the United States.",
      "The Station nightclub fire",
      "The Station nightclub fire\u00a0took place in February 2003 at a club in West Warwick, Rhode Island. The fatal fire resulted in 100 deaths and over 200 injuries.",
      "\"We went out on a Thursday night to listen to music, drink some beers and have a good time. And a quarter of those people didn't get to go home \u2014 ever,\" survivor Linda Saran, who was severely burned in the fire, told CBS News in 2021.",
      "The blaze ignited when the band Jack Russell's Great White took the stage and four large pyrotechnics were set off, sending flames up the walls which spread rapidly across the soundproofing foam. The nightclub owners had installed foam along the club's walls and ceilings to combat noise complaints, but the foam was highly flammable, and the club did not have sprinklers installed.",
      "The exits were also a safety issue. Inspection records showed that three months before the fire, the owners had been cited by the local fire marshal for having a secondary, interior door by the stage that opened inward, which violated regulations. They were told to take it down, but it was still up on the night of the fire.",
      "As the crowd scrambled to escape that night, a stampede of people got stuck in the narrow hallway leading to the front door, blocking many from reaching the exit.",
      "Happy Land Social Club fire",
      "In March 1990, a fire at the\u00a0Happy Land Social Club\u00a0in the Bronx borough of New York City killed 87 people and injured dozens more.",
      "The cause of the fire was arson. A man, Julio Gonzalez, poured gasoline on the floor of the entryway and ignited it following a fight with his girlfriend.",
      "The fire moved so quickly that a few victims still had drinks in their hands while others died hugging or holding hands.",
      "The social club didn't have sprinklers, fire alarms or fire exits. It was operating illegally at the time, as the city had ordered it to close because of the various building and fire code violations.",
      "In the wake of the blaze, New York City tightened fire safety enforcement and stepped up efforts to shut down illegal clubs. Gonzalez was convicted of murder charges for the many deaths in the blaze.",
      "Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire",
      "The Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire, the deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history, occurred on Nov. 28, 1942, at the Cocoanut Grove club in Boston. A total of 492 people died, and hundreds were injured.",
      "The cause was never officially determined, but the fire started in the basement and spread rapidly through the lounge and up a stairway that acted as a chimney. Many patrons were trapped inside because two exit doors were locked and the single revolving door at the front entrance was jammed with people attempting to flee the blaze.",
      "The club was filled to more than twice its legal capacity when the fire started.",
      "Combustible soundproofing material at the club was blamed for the rapid spread of the fire. The tragedy led to changes in building codes and standards \u2014 such as requiring revolving doors to be flanked by outward-opening standard doors \u2014 as well as medical treatment for burns.",
      "\"The impacts of Cocoanut Grove are already forever enshrined in the regulations, safety practices, the innovations and knowledge that have already saved countless lives,\" Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said at a ceremony in 2022 marking 80 years since the blaze.",

      "Tournament officials said Friday that Williams received a wild-card entry for the 2026 tournament at Melbourne Park 28 years after her first appearance. In 1998, the then-17-year-old defeated her younger sister Serena Williams in the second round before losing in the quarterfinals to fellow American Lindsay Davenport.",
      "\"I'm excited to be back in Australia and looking forward to competing during the Australian summer,\" Williams said. \"I've had so many incredible memories there, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to return to a place that has meant so much to my career.\"",
      "Venus Williams made an incredible comeback in the sport in July 2025 when she accepted a wild-card invitation to play singles at the 2025 Mubadala Citi DC Open. She became the second-oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match after beating Peyton Sterns \u2014 22 years her junior \u2014 6-3, 6-4. It was Williams' first singles victory in nearly 2 years.",
      "Williams then went on an electric run at the 2025 U.S. Open when she partnered with Leylah Fernandez in the women's doubles tournament. They reached the quarterfinals, where they lost to Taylor Townsend and Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1.",
      "In November, Williams announced that she would play in Auckland, New Zealand, where she also received a wild card, two weeks before the Australian Open. The Australian Open said Williams was also entered to play a tournament in Hobart, Australia, a week later and just before play begins at Melbourne Park.",
      "She last appeared in Melbourne in 2021 and has finished runner-up in the women's singles twice, losing to Serena in the finals in 2003 and 2017.",
      "Williams' record at Melbourne Park is 54 wins and 21 losses. This year will be the 22nd time she has appeared in the main draw.",

      "Sibray was an acquaintance of Briar's former fianc\u00e9e, 29-year-old Esther Jane Stephen. Stephen, who went by the name E.J., was a local high school softball coach. She and Briar shared a young daughter together.",
      "Sibray, a former police officer, told detectives that in the months leading up to Briar's murder, Stephen came over often and that she was accompanied by her assistant coach, 19-year-old Shelby Hiestand.",
      "During those visits, Sibray said Stephen would confide in her about problems she was having with Briar. Stephen and Briar had recently broken off their engagement, and Briar had filed a court petition to establish parenting time for the daughter they shared.",

      "And Sibray said she had that same mindset when, over time, the conversations grew more detailed \u2014 and various methods were discussed. At one point, Sibray said Stephen and Hiestand told her they put pills in Briar's tea.",

      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",

And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",

      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",

      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "United States leaders reacted early Saturday morning as President Trump confirmed overnight military strikes in Venezuela and announced the capture of the country's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and his wife.",
      "Mr. Trump said Maduro and his wife had been flown out of Venezuela, but did not say where the pair were. Venezuelan officials have called for proof of life. The U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special forces unit, carried out the operation to capture them, officials told CBS News. The Trump administration notified Congressional leaders about the operation only after it began, Congressional sources told CBS News.",
      "Maduro, 63, has led Venezuela since 2013. His most recent election was disputed by international observers and the U.S.\u00a0recognized\u00a0opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner. The U.S. imposed sanctions against election officials for allegedly rigging the outcome, but Maduro was still\u00a0sworn in\u00a0for a third term in January.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Saturday morning that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on narco-terrorism charges.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether the nation's top lawyer was referring only to charges contained in an indictment filed against the Venezuelan leader in 2020, or if there would be new or different charges filed in an indictment Saturday.",
      "In 2020, federal prosecutors alleged that Maduro and other senior Venezuelan government officials collaborated with the Colombian guerrilla group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, to traffic cocaine and weapons to the United States",
      "The Justice Department also accused Maduro of leading a criminal organization called C\u00e1rtel de Los Soles in 2020. The Trump administration designated the group as a\u00a0foreign terrorist organization\u00a0last year, though experts have\u00a0questioned that characterization. The U.S. has been offering a\u00a0$50 million reward for information leading to Maduro's capture.",
      "A\u00a0CBS News poll in November\u00a0found that 70% of Americans would oppose the U.S. taking military action in Venezuela, and 75% said the Trump administration would need Congressional approval. Most surveyed also said they did not see Venezuela as a major threat to the United States.",
      "Republicans react",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said he spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after the operation in Venezuela.",
      "\"Nicolas Maduro is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans after years of trafficking illegal drugs and violent cartel members into our country \u2014 crimes for which he's been properly indicted in U.S. courts and an arrest warrant duly issued \u2014 and today he learned what accountability looks like,\" Johnson said. \"President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Chair Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said he spoke with Rubio and that Venezuela's interim government \"must now decide whether to continue the drug trafficking and colluding with adversaries like Iran and Cuba or whether to act like a normal nation and return to the civilized world.\"",
      "\"I urge them to choose wisely,\" he said.",
      "Utah Sen. Mike Lee said that he also spoke with Rubio, who said that Maduro would be brought to the U.S. Lee also said that Rubio \"anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in U.S. custody.\"",
      "Lee added that the operation \"likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" but did not offer any other details.",
      "Vice President JD Vance praised the \"brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.\"",
      "\"Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says,\" Vance said. The vice president highlighted Maduro's previous indictments as justification for the operation.",
      "\"You don't get to avoid justice for drug trafficking the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas,\" he said.",
      "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, released a statement calling Maduro's capture \"an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.\" He said he spoke to Rubio on Saturday morning and was looking forward to further briefings when the Senate returns next week.",
      "House Intelligence Chair Rick Crawford, a Republican from Arkansas, drew comparisons to the arrest of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in 1990.",
      "\"This is a historic day in the Western Hemisphere, 36 years after the capture of Manuel Noriega, when the U.S showed we will not allow cartels to take over countries in our shared neighborhood. The arrest of Cartel De Los Soles leader Nicolas Maduro shows this clearly,\" Crawford said. \"Venezuela could never start the road back to the great nation it once was until Maduro was out of the way. I call upon the Venezuelan people to reclaim their freedom.\"",
      "Democrats react",
      "Democrat lawmakers criticized the Trump administration for acting unilaterally.",
      "House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, called Maduro \"an illegitimate ruler\" but said he had \"seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos.\"",
      "\"The Administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region and its legal justification for this decision,\" Himes said.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the operation an \"unauthorized military attack\" and a \"sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "\"That history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to make the claim with a straight face that other countries should respect the United States' sovereignty when we do not do the same,\" Kaine said.",
      "He said that his bipartisan resolution stipulating the U.S. not enter war with Venezuela without a clear Congressional authorization will be up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Where will this go next? Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?\" Kaine said. \"Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people's elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk. It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade ... We've entered the 250th year of American democracy and cannot allow it to devolve into the tyranny that our founders fought to escape.\"",
      "Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, said that Mr. Trump \"rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.\" Kim also accused Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of lying to Congress when they met with leaders last month about fatal strikes on alleged drug vessels and said the Trump administration's goal was not regime change.",
      "\"Without authorization from Congress, and with the vast majority of Americans opposed to military action, Trump just launched an unjustified, illegal strike on Venezuela,\" said Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern.",
      "Florida residents cheer operation",
      "South Florida, which is home to a large population of Venezuelans, saw celebrations early Saturday. People hugged, sang the U.S. and Venezuelan national anthems, and waved flags outside the community gathering spot El Arepazo.",
      "\"President Trump has changed the course of history in our hemisphere. Our country & the world are safer for it,\" said Florida Republican Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez. \"Today's decisive action is this hemisphere's equivalent to the Fall of the Berlin Wall. It's a big day in Florida, where the majority of Venezuelan, Cuban, & Nicaraguan exiles reside. This is the community I represent & we are overwhelmed with emotion and hope.\"",

      "President Trump announced the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and his wife early Saturday morning, 36 years to the day after U.S. forces arrested another indicted Latin American leader.",
      "A one-time U.S. ally and CIA informant, Manuel Noriega led Panama for much of the 1980s.",
      "He was raised in the slums of Panama City and rose to prominence under Gen. Omar Torrijos, who seized power in a 1968 coup. After Torrijos was killed in a 1983 plane crash, Noriega took control of the Panamanian government. He was propped up by U.S. officials, who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight drug trafficking.",
      "Noriega spent years on the CIA's payroll, assisting U.S. interests throughout Latin America and acting as a liaison to Cuba's Fidel Castro. Former U.S. officials testified that Noriega's assistance was crucial to advancing foreign policy interests in South America during that time.",
      "Noriega fell out of favor with Washington due to his demands for independence and allegations that he was accepting bribes to allow drugs into the U.S. in the late 1980s. Former President George H.W. Bush ordered the U.S. military to invade Panama in late 1989, sending 24,000 troops to topple Noriega's government. The operation left 23 American soldiers dead and hundreds more injured.",
      "Noriega hid out in the Vatican embassy before surrendering to U.S. authorities on January 3, 1990. He was taken to the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges. His fall led to the end of Panama's military dictatorship.",
      "Noriega was convicted on drug trafficking charges and spent 20 years in an American prison. He was\u00a0extradited to France\u00a0in 2010 to serve a seven-year money laundering sentence. In 2011, he was\u00a0sent to Panama\u00a0to complete a 60-year sentence for murder, corruption and embezzlement during the military's three-decade rule.",
      "In 2015, Noriega gave his first interview in nearly 20 years from his Panamanian prison. He called himself \"the last general of the military era\" and apologized to those \"offended, affected, injured or humiliated\" by his own actions or those of his superiors and subordinates during the military regime.",
      "Noriega died after complications from a surgery to remove a benign brain tumor in 2017. He was 83. Juan Carlos Varela, Panama's president at the time, said that his death \"closes a chapter in our history.\"",
      "House Intelligence Chair Rep. Rick Crawford commented on the connection between Noriega's capture and the operation in Venezuela in a statement shared on social media.",
      "\"This is a historic day in the Western Hemisphere, 36 years after the capture of Manuel Noriega, when the U.S showed we will not allow cartels to take over countries in our shared neighborhood. The arrest of Cartel De Los Soles leader Nicolas Maduro shows this clearly,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Crawford, a Republican from Arkansas. \"Venezuela could never start the road back to the great nation it once was until Maduro was out of the way.

      "At least seven explosions were heard, along with low-flying aircraft, in Venezuela's capital city Caracas around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday. People in various neighborhoods rushed to the streets. Some could be seen in the distance from various areas of Caracas.",
      "Trump administration officials said they were aware of reports of explosions and aircraft, sources told CBS News, but there was no immediate response to requests for the White House to comment and no immediate reaction from Venezuela's government.",
      "President Gustavo Petro of neighboring Colombia\u00a0said in a social media post that someone was \"bombing Caracas in this moment,\" without saying who.",
      "\"Alert to the whole world, they have attacked Venezuela bombing with missiles,\" he said, calling for a meeting of the United Nations.",
      "The reported explosions come after months of the U.S. military targeting alleged drug-smuggling boats in the region, and as the Trump administration exerts pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Thousands of U.S. forces and several naval vessels have been deployed to the region, and President Trump has hinted for weeks at a wider possible military operation.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Maduro's regime of collaborating with drug traffickers, which the Venezuelan government denies. The U.S. has also put pressure on Venezuela's oil sector, seizing two sanctioned oil tankers last month. Mr. Trump announced a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned tankers that enter or exit Venezuela in mid-December.",
      "On Friday, Venezuela said it was open to negotiating an agreement with the United States to combat drug trafficking. Maduro also said in a pretaped interview aired Thursday that the U.S. wants to force a government change in Venezuela and gain access to its vast oil reserves.",
      "Mr. Trump has not explicitly said what his goal for Venezuela is, but said late last month it would be \"smart\" for Maduro to leave power. He also warned that if Maduro \"plays tough, it'll be the last time he'll ever be able to play tough.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump warned Friday in a social media post that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "Mr. Trump offered no further comment on Iran or how the U.S. might intervene to protect protesters in the country in the post on his Truth Social network, which was published just before 3 a.m. Eastern, but he said: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "It came hours after reports that at least eight people have been killed amid nearly a week of escalating protests in Iran. The unrest began last weekend as business owners voiced frustration at the dire economic conditions in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran has been plagued for years by staggering hyperinflation, fueled by Western sanctions imposed over the hardline clerical government's nuclear program and backing for militant groups across the region.",
      "Protests continued Friday in various cities in the country, The Associated Press reported, even as life largely continued unaffected in the capital, Tehran. Demonstrations have reached over 100 locations in 22 of Iran's 31 provinces, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported. It said the death toll in the demonstrations rose with the death of a demonstrator in Marvdasht in Iran's Fars province.",
      "Videos and photos from Tehran and other cities posted on social media have shown protesters marching through streets from early this week, often chanting anti-government, pro-monarchy slogans and sometimes clashing violently with security forces.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News the current round of protests were triggered in part by shopkeepers upset by Iran's weakening currency. Shopkeepers tend to be a fairly conservative group, he noted, but many have warned that the country's economic troubles have made operating their businesses untenable.",
      "\"They don't come out in the streets unless they really have to,\" Vatanka said. \"And they've done it now, which sort of gives you an indication how dire the situation has become.\"",
      "In an apparent bid to quell the unrest, Iranian authorities have acknowledged the economic concerns and said peaceful protests are legitimate, but suggested that foreign powers \u2014 usually a reference to Israel and the U.S. \u2014 are behind subversive elements fueling violence on the streets.",
      "Reacting to the latest remarks by the U.S. president, Ali Larijani, a former speaker of Iran's parliament who's now the secretary of the country's National Security Council, said Friday in his own social media post that \"Trump should know that intervention by the U.S. in the domestic problem corresponds to chaos in the entire region and the destruction of the U.S. interests.\"",
      "\"The people of the U.S. should know that Trump began the adventurism,\" said Larijani.",
      "\"They should take care of their own soldiers,\" he added, in what appeared to be a reference to the U.S. military forces based across the Middle East, who are in easy range of Iran's vast stockpile of ballistic missiles.",
      "There was a more sternly worded warning from Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said \"any interventionist hand that gets too close to the security of Iran will be cut.\"",
      "\"The people of Iran properly know the experience of 'being rescued' by Americans: from Iraq and Afghanistan to Gaza,\" he said in a social media post.",
      "Both the U.S. and Israeli governments had issued statements in support of the protests in Iran prior to Mr. Trump's warning on Friday morning of a possible, unspecified U.S. intervention.",
      "\"The people of Iran want freedom. They have suffered at the hands of the Ayatollahs for too long,\" Mike Waltz, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said in a post on X earlier this week. \"We stand with Iranians in the streets of Tehran and across the country as they protest a radical regime that has brought them nothing but economic downturn and war.\"",
      "Vatanka told CBS News it's not clear what steps the Trump administration might take to support the protesters or push back on a crackdown by the Iranian regime. But he believes Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden the protesters.",
      "\"We shouldn't underestimate the value of an American president who floats the idea of U.S. support for the protests,\" he said. \"It could just be the ... one ingredient you need to keep this movement, the street-level movement alive, because in recent years, these protests have tended to sort of die down after a few days [or a] few weeks.\"",
      "Tension between the U.S. and Iran escalated this week on the heels of a visit to the U.S. by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has campaigned his country's close allies in Washington for decades to take a tougher stance on Iran.",
      "After meeting with Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Sunday, Mr. Trump said he had heard that Iran could be attempting to rebuild its nuclear program following the unprecedented U.S. strikes on its enrichment facilities in June. Mr. Trump warned that if Iran did try to rebuild, \"we'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Iranian President Mahsoud Pezeshkian said Tehran would respond \"to any cruel aggression\" with unspecified \"harsh and discouraging\" measures.",
      "Iran is no stranger to nationwide protests, and the latest demonstrations have not come close to the last major outbreak in 2022, which was triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian woman.",
      "Her death in custody after being arrested for allegedly violating the nation's strict dress code for women sparked a wave of anger across the nation. Several hundred people were killed, including dozens of members of the security forces, who waged a dramatic crackdown in response, arresting hundreds of people.",
      "There were also widespread protests in 2019, sparked by a sharp increase in the price of petrol.",
      "The standoff between Iran and the U.S. over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program reached a crescendo in June, when Mr. Trump ordered the deadly military strikes against Iran's enrichment facilities, as Israel also carried out strikes on the country.",
      "While Mr. Trump indicated earlier this week that the U.S. could take new action if Iran were to rebuild its nuclear program, Friday's brief post on social media was the first suggestion of a possible American intervention on behalf of Iranian protesters.",

      "Widening demonstrations sparked by Iran's ailing economy spread Thursday into the Islamic Republic's rural provinces, with at least eight people being killed in the first fatalities reported among security forces and protesters, authorities said.",
      "The deaths may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran's theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded elsewhere. The fatalities, one on Wednesday and five on Thursday, occurred in three cities predominantly home to Iran's Lur ethnic group.",
      "The protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the demonstrations have yet to be countrywide and have not been as intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.",
      "The latest protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well. The country's leaders are still reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country in June. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the war.",
      "\"The people of Iran want freedom. They have suffered at the hands of the Ayatollahs for too long,\" Mike Waltz, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said in a\u00a0post on X earlier this week.",
      "\"We stand with Iranians in the streets of Tehran and across the country as they protest a radical regime that has brought them nothing but economic downturn and war,\" he said.",
      "The most intense violence appeared to strike Azna, a city in Iran's Lorestan province, some 185 miles southwest of Tehran. There, online videos purported to show objects in the street ablaze and gunfire echoing as people shouted: \"Shameless! Shameless!\"",
      "The semiofficial Fars news agency reported three people had been killed. Other media, including pro-reform outlets, cited Fars for the report while state-run media did not fully acknowledge the violence there or elsewhere. It wasn't clear why there wasn't more reporting over the unrest, but journalists had faced arrest over their reporting in 2022.",
      "In Lordegan, a city in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, online videos showed demonstrators gathered on a street, with the sound of gunfire in the background. The footage matched known features of Lordegan, some 290 miles south of Tehran.",
      "Fars, citing an anonymous official, said two people were killed during the protests Thursday.",
      "The Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said two people had been killed there, identifying the dead as demonstrators. It also shared a still image of what appeared to be an Iranian police officer, wearing body armor and wielding a shotgun.",
      "In 2019, the area around Lordegan saw widespread protests and demonstrators reportedly damaged government buildings after a report said people there had been infected with HIV by contaminated needles used at a local health care clinic.",
      "A separate demonstration Wednesday night reportedly led to the death of a 21-year-old volunteer in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Basij force.",
      "The state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member's death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, which is believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Lorestan province.",
      "The Guard member \"was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,\" he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.",
      "\"The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,\" Pourali said. \"The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.\"",
      "The protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, over 250 miles southwest of Tehran. Local prosecutor Kazem Nazari said 20 people had been arrested after the protests and that calm had returned to the city, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.",
      "Iran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters. However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.",
      "Meanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had links to European-based groups.

    "story": [
      "Crans-Montana, Switzerland \u2014\u00a0Investigators said Friday that the deadly fire that\u00a0tore through a popular bar\u00a0in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana early on New Year's Day was caused by sparklers on Champagne bottles, which ignited the bar's ceiling.",
      "Police have said about 40 people were killed and dozens were badly injured. Most of the victims were just teenagers celebrating the holiday, and the intensity of the deadly fire has left authorities with grim work to identify badly burned remains, which they say may take days, as desperate families are left to wait for word of their missing loved ones.",
      "Swiss authorities said Friday that 113 out of the 119 people injured had been identified.",
      "Beatrice Pilloud, the attorney general for Switzerland's Valais Canton, said authorities have interviewed two bar managers to help them understand the internal configuration of the venue and its capacity. She said the investigation was still ongoing.",
      "Video has emerged that shows the moment a man tried but failed to snuff the first flames in the basement of the Le Constellation bar with a white cloth. The fire swept upward, to the upper level of the building.",
      "In videos posted on social media, people can be heard screaming as dozens raced to try and escape through narrow exits. Many suffered horrific burns and smoke inhalation, and dozens remained hospitalized on Friday across the country, as well as in neighboring France, Italy and Germany.",
      "Some 36 hours after the disaster, which authorities say appears to have been accidental, at least two dozen people were still missing.",
      "The facade of the bar was hidden on Friday behind a white barricade.",
      "One survivor said bar staff had inadvertently sparked the inferno.",
      "\"One woman climbed onto another woman's shoulders with two bottles and birthday sparklers were going off,\" said 16-year-old French visitor Axel Cavalier. \"She waved them too high, they hit the ceiling and it caught fire.\"",
      "Lucas Rebot, 24, told CBS News he and his girlfriend tried to get into Le Constellation at 1 a.m., about 30 minutes before the fire started, but were told the venue was full and were turned away. He said he had been at the bar a few days earlier and noticed at the time that the ceiling was covered in foam insulation, \"like a music studio.\"",
      "CBS News' partner network BBC News and France's BFM TV published photos Friday that they said showed the moment the sound insulation on the ceiling was set alight just above people holding sparklers, as described by the witnesses.",
      "Other witnesses have relayed similar information. Authorities said early on in the investigation that there was no indication of an attack or explosion.",
      "\"At no moment is there a question of any kind of attack,\" Pilloud said Thursday, adding later that it was unclear how many people had been in the bar at the time of the fire, but that its maximum capacity would be one of the factors looked at as part of the investigation.",
      "\"For the time being, we don't have any suspects,\" she said when asked if anyone had been arrested. \"An investigation has been opened, not against anyone, but to better understand the circumstances of this dramatic fire.\"",
      "Forensic experts, meanwhile, have begun using dental and DNA records to identify the dead.",
      "Clavier said one of his friends had died in the fire and two or three more were among those still listed as missing.",
      "\"The first objective is to assign names to all the bodies,\" Crans-Montana's mayor Nicolas Feraud said Thursday, adding that it could take days.",
      "Mathias Reynard, who heads the regional Valais government, said it was essential to carry out the work \"because the information is so terrible and sensitive that nothing can be told to the families unless we are 100 percent sure.\"",
      "One of the first victims identified was a promising young Italian golfer Emanuele Galeppini, who was mourned by the Italian Golf Federation in a statement issued Thursday as \"a young athlete who embodied passion and authentic values.\"",
      "Crans-Montana is a popular destination for skiing, but is also an international golf resort in the warmer months.",
      "Italian outlet SportMedia said Galeppini, originally from Genoa, was 16 years old. It said his father was in Crans-Montana and had spent much of Thursday searching for information about his missing son.",

      "\"I feel like it's actually a nightmare, that I'm going to wake up,\" Huguenin told journalists on Thursday. \"I closed my eyes, and everything kept coming back to me, because I saw people being resuscitated. I saw people completely burned. I saw people dying. Honestly, it was quite complicated and quite difficult to stomach.\"",
      "The Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski town of Crans-Montana was popular with a younger crowd. The legal age to drink wine and beer in the Valais region where it's located is 16, so many young people had come to the bar to celebrate the new year.",
      "The owner of a nearby store told British broadcaster Sky News that Le Constellation was known for letting young people in.",

      "Describing the situation as \"total chaos,\" Clavier said he managed to escape by forcing a window open with a table. He said one of his friends was killed, two or three remain missing, and he was \"still in shock.\"",
      "A witness named Alexis, 18, who saw the fire from outside Le Constellation, told local media that many people inside had tried to break through the windows, according to British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mail.",
      "\"It was a real flame coming out. It was coming out and ... in fact, people were running through these flames,\" he said. \"You could see the shadows. People were trying to break the glass with chairs in the bar.\"",
      "Another witness, who chose not to share his name, told CBS News' partner network BBC News that he thought his brother was in the bar when the fire broke out.",
      "\"I came and tried to break the window to help people to exit, and after that I went in,\" he told the BBC. Inside, he said he \"saw people burning ... I found people burning from head to foot, no clothes anymore.\"",
      "He said his brother had not been hurt, and that he could easily have been in the bar himself.",
      "\"I went in this bar every day this week,\" he told the BBC. \"The day I didn't go, it burned.\"",
      "Oscar, 19, also witnessed the fire and told Sky News Le Constellation was \"a very popular bar with teenagers, so I think it's a highly concentrated place where you find a lot of teenagers. That's why we wanted to go there.\"",
      "He said he and his friends had tried to get into the bar on New Year's Eve, but had been told it was full.",
      "\"But we knew, like, other ways in,\" Oscar said.",
      "He said he tried using a code to access a side door, and getting someone already in the bar to open another entrance for him and his friends, but nothing worked.",
      "\"Like three minutes later, we're just in front, like three meters away \u2014 it exploded. It's crazy,\" said Oscar. \"Many people tried running out and people were banging on the windows, because it's like a winter garden \u2026 It's like a semi-outside spot but still with windows. And everyone was banging on the windows and stuff. Screaming. It was like a horror movie. But they couldn't get out. I think the windows were too thick. Then people, like, fell on each other coming out, fully burned.\"",
      "\"Even people ask me: Am I burned in my face, am I burned?\" Oscar recalled. \"Because I think the adrenaline made them not feel anything. Because they were completely, I don't know, fully burned and they didn't feel anything.\"",

      "\"What are they seeking? It is clear that they seek to impose themselves through threats, intimidation and force,\" Maduro said, later adding that it is time for both nations to \"start talking seriously, with data in hand.\"",
      "\"The U.S. government knows, because we've told many of their spokespeople, that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we're ready,\" he said. \"If they want oil, Venezuela is ready for U.S. investment, like with Chevron, whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it.\"",
      "Chevron Corp. is the only major oil company exporting Venezuelan crude to the U.S. Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves.",
      "The interview was taped on New Year's Eve, the same day the U.S. military announced strikes\u00a0against five more alleged drug-smuggling boats.

      "A fire at a crowded bar in the Swiss Alps during New Year's Eve celebrations killed about 40 people and left 115 injured, many of them seriously, police said Thursday. Switzerland's president said many of the dead were teenagers.",
      "The blaze tore through a bar called Le Constellation in the Alpine ski resort municipality of Crans-Montana, Switzerland.",
      "Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, said it was too early to determine the cause of the fire, but indicated it was not related to terrorism.",
      "\"At no moment is there a question of any kind of attack,\" Pilloud said.",
      "Experts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage. Pilloud said the number of people who were in the bar is \"currently totally unknown,\" adding that its maximum capacity will be part of the investigation.",
      "\"An investigation has been opened, not against anyone, but to illuminate the circumstances of this dramatic fire,\" she said.",
      "The fire broke out around 1:30 a.m. local time, and helicopters and ambulances rushed to the scene to assist victims, officials said.",
      "\"More than a hundred people were in the building, and we are seeing many injured and many dead,\" police spokesperson Ga\u00ebtan Lathion said.",
      "\"We are devastated,\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gisler, commander of the Valais Cantonal police, said during a news conference.",
      "The injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theater at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, according to regional councilor Mathias Reynard. He said it's likely that some burn patients will soon be transferred to neighboring countries for treatment.",
      "The European Union said it has been in contact with Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance. France's foreign ministry said several survivors have been transferred to to French \u200dhospitals.",
      "\"We're just at the beginning of our investigation, but this is an internationally renowned ski resort with lots of tourists,\" Lathion said.",
      "Officials said they expected a number of foreign nationals to be among the dead. France said eight of its citizens were missing.",
      "\"There were people screaming\"",
      "Cellphone video captured harrowing images of of the tragedy's first moments as flames swept across the wooden ceiling of the bar's basement level, panicking partygoers who rushed to escape. The fire then rose up and engulfed the upper level.",
      "Two women told French broadcaster BFMTV that they were inside when they saw a bartender carrying a waitress on his shoulders. They said she was holding a lit candle in a bottle that set fire to the wooden ceiling. The flames quickly spread and collapsed the ceiling, they told the broadcaster.",
      "\"In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood,\" one of the women said, according to a BBC News translation.",
      "They described a crowd surge as people frantically tried to escape from the basement level up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door.",
      "There were \"about 200 people trying to get out within 30 seconds through some very narrow steps,\" BBC quoted the woman as saying. \"We were very lucky.\"",
      "Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris who survived the blaze, described \"total chaos\" inside the bar. One of his friends died and \"two or three were missing,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "He said he hadn't seen the fire start, but did see waitresses arrive with Champagne bottles with sparklers, he said.",
      "Clavier said he felt like he was suffocating and initially hid behind a table, then ran upstairs and tried to use a table to break a Plexiglas window. It fell out of its casing, allowing him to escape.",
      "\"I'm still in shock,\" he said.",
      "Another witness speaking to BFMTV described people smashing windows to escape the blaze, some gravely injured, and panicked parents rushing to the scene in cars to see whether their children were trapped inside. The young man said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames and likened what he saw to a horror movie as he watched from across the street.",
      "Local resident Samuel Rapp, 21, was at a restaurant nearby and went to the scene after the blaze broke out.",
      "\"Police and paramedics ... had already set up a protective perimeter,\" he told the Reuters news agency. \"There were people screaming, and then people lying on \u200cthe ground, probably dead. They had jackets over their faces.\"",
      "Officials called the blaze an \"embrasement g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9,\" a firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.",
      "Flashover can happen fast \u2014 within just a few minutes \u2014 when a rapid increase in heat reaches the combustion point and engulfs the entire space in fire.",
      "Officials said they are prioritizing forensic work so that the bodies of the victims can be returned to their families, but said the process may take several days, Reuters reported.",
      "\"This evening should have been a moment of celebration and coming together, but it turned into a nightmare,\" said Reynard, the regional government leader.",
      "\"What was a moment of joy turned into a tragedy in Crans-Montana last night, felt across the country and beyond,\" Swiss President Guy Parmelin said in a social media post. \"The Federal Council has taken note of this with deep dismay. Its thoughts are with the victims, the injured and their families and it extends its deepest condolences.\"",
      "Hundreds of people stood in silence near the scene as they came to pay their respects to the victims on Thursday night. Many left flowers or lit candles at a growing memorial site along the road leading to the bar, which police had cordoned off. Some cried, others quietly hugged one another.",
      "In a region busy with tourists skiing on the slopes, the authorities have called on the local population to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require medical resources that are already overwhelmed.",
      "The Crans-Montana community is in the heart of the Swiss Alps, just 25 miles north of the Matterhorn.",
      "With high-altitude ski runs in the heart of the Swiss Alps, Crans-Montana is one of the winter sports centers of Switzerland's ski-crazy Valais region, also home to Zermatt, Verbier and other resorts nestled in the snowy peaks and pine forests that draw winter sports enthusiasts from across the planet. The resort is one of the top race venues on the World Cup circuit in Alpine skiing and will host the next world championships over two weeks in February 2027.",
      "In four weeks' time, the resort will host the best men's and women's downhill racers for their last events before going to the Milan Cortina Olympics, which open on Feb. 6.",

      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \"horrible, horrible\" French.",

It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",
      "The decision was also defended by Vedrenne's superior at the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, who said he signed the naturalization decree.",
      "\"It's a big chance for our country,\" he said.",
      "In recent media interviews, when he was promoting \"Jay Kelly,\" Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app. He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly.",
      "\"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French\u00a0broadcaster Canal+.",
      "French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.",
      "In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney said: \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\"",
      "\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he said. Growing up away from the spotlight in France, \"they have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson has the latest on how a biotech company plans to test its vaccine that could protect people from fentanyl's lethal effects on 'Special Report.'",
      "A vaccine to protect against fentanyl\u2019s deadly effects is headed for clinical trials in humans.",
      "The vaccine, which showed positive results in studies of mice and rats, is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses.",
      "If approved, it would become the first treatment to prevent overdoses of fentanyl, which is the leading cause of drug overdose death, statistics show. This is different than treatments like naloxone, which reverse the effects after an overdose.",
      "DEADLY DRUG MIX DRIVES STAGGERING RISE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AMONG SENIORS",
      "How it works",
      "The vaccine is designed to create antibodies against fentanyl, which keeps the drug from crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier. It contains a synthetic fragment of fentanyl attached to a protein called CRM197, along with dmLT, an immune-activating compound.",
      "The vaccine is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses. (iStock)",
      "This combination stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that capture fentanyl in the bloodstream before it can reach the brain, according to the University of Houston's Colin Haile, co-founder and scientific adviser of ARMR Sciences, which licensed the vaccine.",
      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain. They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, the fentanyl would be eliminated from the body.",
      "MAJOR CANNABIS STUDY FINDS LITTLE PROOF FOR POPULAR MEDICAL CLAIMS, FLAGS BIG DANGERS",
      "In the mice and rat studies, the animals still had antibodies against fentanyl six months after vaccination, added Haile, who is also a research associate professor of psychology at UH and a founding member of the UH Drug Discovery Institute.",
      "While some have questioned whether such a vaccine would indirectly encourage drug use, Haile pointed out that for vaccinated people, the drug would have \"no euphoric effects,\" so those seeking a \"high\" would not get it.",
      "Fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana. (iStock)",
      "The main benefit, according to Haile, is that the vaccine would reduce the potential health dangers of fentanyl.",
      "\"Respiratory depression is the primary effect that induces death from this highly potent synthetic opioid,\" he said.",
      "Headed for trials",
      "Following successful testing in mice and rats, the first human clinical trial is slated to begin in early 2026 at the Center for Human Drug Research, which is associated with the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.",
      "\"They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "The small phase 1 trial will enroll about 40 participants, focusing on safety and immune response.",
      "After the phase 1 trial for safety, a phase 2 trial will test whether the vaccine effectively blocks fentanyl\u2019s effects in humans.",
      "Potential risks and limitations",
      "The primary limitation is that data is so far only available for mouse models, and it\u2019s unknown how effective the vaccine would be in humans.",
      "Haile told Fox News Digital that there were no adverse side effects reported in the animal study, likely because the ingredients of the vaccine are proteins that have already been used in other combinations in humans, so their safety profile is already known.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\"Also, unlike other vaccines, we use extremely low doses of the components,\" he noted. \"We have put the vaccine into a lot of animals and have not seen any adverse side effects at all.\"",

      "Potential use cases",

      "Military and national security personnel could also benefit from the vaccine, Haile said, as it could help protect against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds that have been used as chemical threats.",
      "Finally, parents may be seeking protection for at-risk teens or young adults, as fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana.",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for Fox News, said the progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside.\" (iStock)",
      "Looking ahead, Haile said this could pave the way for the approval of other anti-drug vaccines, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, which are already in the works.",
      "\"If we can tackle the primary ones \u2014 fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine \u2014 we will be saving hundreds of thousands of lives,\" he added.",

      "A study published in JAMA in January 2025 \u2014 which looked at more than 125,000 overweight or obese people \u2014 found that nearly 47% of those with type 2 diabetes and 65% of those without diabetes stopped taking their prescribed GLP-1s within a year of starting them.",
      "Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and obesity specialist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, told The New York Times in a recent report that people over 65 years old are \"prime targets\" for this medication, as obesity prevalence is about 40% in older adults.",

      "Below are four of the main reasons seniors might not stick to their GLP-1 prescriptions.",
      "No. 1: Cost",
      "The price of GLP-1 medications is a major factor in keeping up with treatment, especially as shortages threaten availability.",
      "The New York Times shared the story of 75-year-old Mary Bucklew, a public transit retiree living in Delaware, who had been paying just a $25 monthly co-pay through her health insurance plan to receive Ozempic for weight loss.",

      "\"Far too many people who need obesity treatments still face cost and coverage barriers,\" said Ilya Yuffa, executive vice president and president for Lilly USA, in the announcement. \"Today\u2019s action underscores Lilly\u2019s commitment to improving access across the obesity care landscape. We will keep working to provide more options \u2014 expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access \u2014 so more people can get the medicines they need.\"",
      "No. 2: Side effects",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Sue Decotiis, a medical weight loss doctor in New York City, confirmed that more than half of seniors stop taking a GLP-1 medication due to cost or side effects.",
      "Gastrointestinal side effects are the most common side effect of GLP-1s. (iStock)",

      "No. 4: Muscle loss",
      "Muscle loss, which is another side effect of GLP-1 medications, can be \"detrimental\" in this age group, Decotiis cautioned.",
      "When people are dehydrated or don\u2019t consume enough protein, they may lose more muscle and less fat, she said.",
      "Muscle mass loss occurs naturally with age and can be worsened by weight loss drugs, experts warn. (iStock)",

He recommends that physicians conduct regular body measurements of patients and adjust the medication dosage if benchmarks are not being met.",
      "Finding success and sticking to it",

      "\"Many of the patients who quit their GLP-1 drugs could have stayed on them with the right personalized care.\"",
      "\"Often, using a customized dosing plan helps the patient avoid undue side effects and helps them burn more fat, which is the mechanism by which GLP drugs work long-term and systemically,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"For certain patients, a high-quality compounded GLP-1 can achieve tailored dosing.\"",

      "If the stress of the holidays wreaked havoc on your gut, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 76% of Americans experience gastrointestinal distress during the holiday season, according to a recent national survey from Oshi Health and YouGov.",
      "Digestive problems can be triggered not only by holiday overeating, but also by stress. Financial worries, disrupted routines, fatigue and interpersonal dynamics rank as some of the top causes.",
      "\"I see an uptick in psychiatry-related GI issues during the holiday season,\" Dr. Claire Brandon, a gastrointestinal psychiatrist based in New York City, told Fox News Digital. \"When you are undergoing stress, your body produces more corticotropin-releasing hormones, which sets off a cascade of the inflammatory system.\"",

      "Stress hormones can act directly on the gut, leading to more digestive distress and pushing the body out of \"rest-and-digest mode,\" Brandon said.",
      "\"Stress activates the sympathetic \u2014 fight, flight, freeze \u2014 nervous system, which slows digestion,\" added Dr. David Clarke, an Oregon-based gastroenterologist and president of the Association for the Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms. \"That can lead to bloating, cramps, nausea and sometimes abdominal pain.\"",
      "Stress often plays a bigger role in digestive issues than overeating alone, experts say. (iStock)",
      "The good news, doctors say, is that a few simple, realistic steps can help reset the digestive system after the holidays.",
      "No. 1: Reset your sleep",
      "Sleep plays a major role in gut health. Research shows that insufficient or disrupted sleep can change the composition and function of the gut microbiome, potentially affecting metabolic and immune factors that influence overall health.",
      "NOT ALL FIBER IS CREATED EQUAL \u2014 DOCTORS SHARE WHICH KINDS TRULY SUPPORT LONGEVITY",
      "\"When I travel and get derailed, my main focus is to reset my sleep,\" Brandon said. She recommends reestablishing wind-down routines like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation.",
      "No. 2: Eat balanced, fiber-rich meals",
      "Fiber helps keep digestion moving and supports healthy gut bacteria, which can aid post-holiday recovery, experts say.",
      "\"The usual principles for supporting digestion apply here,\" said Clarke. \"Consuming a balanced diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes; avoiding highly processed foods; and moderating alcohol will keep your gut microbiome happy.\"",
      "Digestive symptoms like bloating and discomfort often spike during the holidays due to stress, travel and disrupted routines. (iStock)",
      "No. 3: Stay hydrated",

      "Traveling can be particularly tough on the gut, experts say, especially during flights where low cabin humidity causes the body to pull water from the bowels, leading to constipation.",
      "Drinking water before, during, and after flights \u2014 and limiting alcohol and caffeine \u2014 can help counteract dehydration-related digestive slowdowns. Experts also recommend sipping water consistently throughout the day.",
      "No. 4: Resume regular movement",
      "Both doctors agreed that exercise supports digestion and stress regulation, which are both key to gut recovery.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Going on walks can be enough to help with this, but if you have space to do more, including some gentle stretching, that can be a huge help,\" Brandon advised.",
      "No. 5: Reduce stress gradually",
      "Stress management plays a critical role in gut health, and experts say that small, consistent habits can help ease gastrointestinal symptoms.",
      "Brandon recommends calming the nervous system with breathing or grounding exercises and slowing down at meals.",
      "Light movement can help support digestion and regulate stress, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"If you\u2019re constantly running on fumes, on a layover in the airport, eating high sugar and doing things off your routine, expect a few disruptions with your gut,\" she said. \"Reframe it as something that you can reset when you get home.\"",
      "No. 6: Skip cleanses and detoxes",
      "Clarke says that detoxes and cleanses are not necessary and can actually be harmful. Instead, he recommends sticking to the basics \u2014 including hydration, balanced meals, regular sleep and movement.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Doctors say the gut is designed to recover on its own in response to consistently healthy practices rather than extreme resets.",

      "Former special counsel Jack Smith used a closed-door deposition with House Republicans last month to defend his investigations into Donald Trump's alleged effort to subvert the 2020 presidential election and his alleged retention of certain classified documents, using the hours-long testimony to forcefully dispute the notion that his team had acted politically, and citing what he described as ample evidence to support the indictments that had been levied against Trump.",
      "\"I made my decisions in the investigation without regard to President Trump\u2019s political association, activities, beliefs or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election,\" Smith told members of the House Judiciary Committee in the Dec. 17 interview.",
      "The interview was Smith's first time appearing before Congress since he left his role as special counsel in 2024. And while much of the information was not new, the exchange was punctuated by sharp exchanges with Republicans on the panel, both on the strength of the case and on his own actions taken during the course of the probe \u2014 most recently, on the tolling records his team sought from a handful of Republican lawmakers over the course of the investigation. Republicans have assailed the records as being at odds with the speech or debate clause of the Constitution.",
      "\"I made my decisions in the investigation without regard to President Trump\u2019s political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election,\" Smith told the committee. \"We took actions based on what the facts, and the law required \u2014 the very lesson I learned early in my career as a prosecutor.\"",
      "Republicans on the panel ultimately opted to publish the redacted transcript on New Year's Eve, a decision that may have helped dull the impact of any news the 255-page document may have generated amid the broader hustle and bustle of the holiday season.",

      "Special Counsel Jack Smith arrives to make remarks on a recently unsealed indictment including four felony counts against former President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)",
      "Smith was\u00a0tapped by former Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to investigate the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as Trump's keeping of allegedly classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach after leaving office in 2020. Smith had brought charges against Trump in both cases.",
      "The charges were dropped after Trump's election, in keeping with a longstanding Justice Department policy that discourages investigating sitting presidents for federal criminal charges, and Smith resigned from his role shortly afterward.",
      "If nothing else, Smith's Dec. 17 testimony underscored just how much has changed since Trump's reelection in 2024.",
      "Trump, for his part, has used his first year back in office to follow through on his promises to go after his perceived political \"enemies,\" including by revoking security clearances of many individuals, including employees of a D.C.-based law firm that represents Smith, and taking other punitive measures to punish or fire FBI agents involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, investigation.",
      "During his testimony last month, Smith fiercely disputed the notion that Trump's remarks about the 2020 election results would be protected by the First Amendment.",
      "\"Absololutely not,\" he said in response to a lawyer for Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "The lawyer then ticked through a \"long list of disputed elections\" in U.S. history and former presidents who have spoken out about \"what they believed to be fraud,\" or other issues regarding election integrity. \"I think you would agree that those types of statements are sort of at the core of the First Amendment rights of a presidential candidate, right?\"",
      "\"There is no historical analog for what President Trump did in this case,\" Smith said immediately.",

      "Smith told members that the special counsel ultimately gathered evidence against Trump that was, in his view, sufficient to secure a conviction.",
      "\"He made false statements to state legislatures, to his supporters in all sorts of contexts and was aware in the days leading up to Jan. 6th that his supporters were angry when he invited them, and then he directed them to the Capitol,\" Smith said of Trump' actions in the run-up to Jan. 6.",
      "\"Now, once they were at the Capitol and once the attack on the Capitol happened, he refused to stop it. He instead issued a tweet that, without question in my mind, endangered the life of his own vice president,\" Smith added. \"And when the violence was going on, he had to be pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.\"",
      "Other possible co-conspirators had not been charged, as Smith noted at one point during the interview.",
      "But Smith said in the testimony that his team had developed \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" that Trump had \"engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.\"",
      "They'd also developed what he described as \"powerful evidence\" that Trump had willfully retained highly classified documents after leaving office in January 2021 at his private Mar-a-Lago residence, and had been obstructing the government's efforts to recover the records.",
      "Smith said that, when the special counsel wound down in the wake of the 2024 elections, his team had not determined whether to charge the key Trump allies who may or may not have acted as co-conspirators, including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and John Eastman.",
      "\"As we stated in the final report, we analyzed the evidence against different co-conspirators,\" Smith said. Smith reiterated his allegation that Trump was \"the most culpable\" and \"most responsible\" person for the alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 election results.",
      "He said the special counsel had \"determined that we did have evidence to charge people at a certain point in time.\"",

      "Smith used his opening remarks to lament the ousting of FBI agents and Justice Department officials involved in the Jan. 6 investigations.",
      "\"I am both saddened and angered that President Trump has sought revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents, and support staff simply for doing their jobs and for having worked on those cases,\" Smith said.",

      "Thousands of FBI personnel in February were forced to fill out a sprawling questionnaire asking employees detailed questions about any role they may have played in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots \u2014 ranging from whether they had testified in any criminal trials to when they last participated in investigation-related activity.",

      "Smith said the Public Integrity Section had signed off on the subpoenas, a point corroborated by records previously released by Grassley\u2019s office.",
      "Those records also showed that the Public Integrity Section told prosecutors to be wary of concerns lawmakers could raise about the Constitution's speech or debate clause, which gives Congress members added protections.",
      "The subpoenas to the phone companies were accompanied by gag orders blocking the lawmakers from learning about the existence of the subpoenas for at least one year. Smith said the D.C. federal court, which authorized the gag orders, would not have been aware that they applied to Congress members.\" I don\u2019t think we identified that, because I don\u2019t think that was Department policy at the time,\" Smith said.",
      "Asked during the deposition about who should be held accountable for lawmakers who felt that the seizure of a narrow set of their phone data was a constitutional violation, Smith said Trump should be held accountable.",

      "Cybercriminals have always chased whatever people trust the most. First, it was email. Then search results. Now it's AI chat answers. Researchers are warning about a new campaign where fake AI conversations are showing up in Google search results and quietly pushing Mac users to install dangerous malware. What makes this especially risky is that everything looks helpful, legitimate and step-by-step, right up until your system is compromised.",
      "The malware being spread is Atomic macOS Stealer, often called AMOS, and the attacks abuse conversations generated by tools people increasingly rely on for everyday help. Investigators have confirmed that both ChatGPT and Grok were misused as part of this campaign.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "One copied terminal command is all it takes for malware like AMOS to quietly install itself on a Mac. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake AI chat results lead to malware",
      "Researchers traced one infection back to a simple Google search: \"clear disk space on macOS.\" Instead of landing on a normal help article, the user was shown what looked like an AI conversation result embedded directly in search. That conversation offered clear, confident instructions and ended by telling the user to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command installed AMOS.",
      "When researchers followed the same trail, they found multiple poisoned AI conversations appearing for similar searches. That consistency strongly suggests this was a deliberate operation aimed at Mac users searching for routine maintenance help.",
      "If this feels familiar, it should. A previous campaign used sponsored search results and SEO-poisoned links that pointed to fake macOS software hosted on GitHub. In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",

      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",

      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a look at how artificial intelligence could vastly improve the healthcare system but points out human doctors are still needed in the equation on The Story.",
      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",

      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",
      "Healthcare activities most likely to trigger disclosure",

      "These areas are considered high impact because they directly affect access to care and understanding of health information.",
      "Risks of failing to disclose AI use",
      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",

      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

      "Why data brokers make it so hard to delete your information",
      "Technically, data brokers have to delete your data if you request it. But here's the part they don't advertise: They want you to give up. Some brokers hide their opt-out pages behind dozens of clicks. Others require you to fax forms, upload IDs, or repeat the request every 30\u201390 days because they\u00a0reactivate your profile without warning.

Shoppers often share email addresses, phone numbers and location data to unlock discounts and faster checkout.",
      "Holiday spending continues to rise year over year. More spending means more data. As a result, your personal information spreads across more databases than at any other time of the year.",
      "After the holiday rush, data brokers update and expand their profiles using newly collected information. January is when many of these companies organize, repackage and resell their datasets.",
      "Starting the removal process early helps limit how widely your information gets shared. Since removals can take days or even weeks, acting now reduces exposure before that data circulates further.",
      "From January through April, scammers ramp up activity tied to tax season. Common threats include\u00a0IRS impersonation scams, fake refund messages and W-2 fraud. Many of these attacks rely on data pulled from broker databases.",
      "When scammers have accurate personal details, their messages feel more convincing. Reducing your data exposure now lowers the risk. Removing your information from major data broker sites is a strong first step. It also helps to check smaller, lesser-known sites that may still list your details.",

      "AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED",
      "Strong passwords and two-factor authentication stop most account takeovers before they start. (Peter Steffen/picture alliance)",
      "1) Start the year with strong passwords",
      "Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.",
      "3) Audit your digital presence",
      "Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Simple habits like updating software and thinking before you click block common scams. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Keep software and devices up to date",
      "Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service",
      "Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.",

      "Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.",

      "Backups, secure Wi-Fi and identity monitoring help limit damage when breaches happen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection",
      "Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network",
      "Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.",
      "9) Back up your data regularly",
      "Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.",
      "10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it",
      "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Pro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases",
      "Your email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.",
      "By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.",

Attackers are using the domain rnicrosoft.com to impersonate Microsoft and steal login credentials. The trick is simple. Instead of the letter m, scammers place r and n side by side. In many fonts, those letters blur together and look almost identical to an m at a quick glance.",

      "Why your brain falls for the rn trick",
      "This attack relies on how people read. Your brain predicts words instead of scanning each letter. When something looks familiar, you fill in the gaps automatically. On a large desktop monitor, a careful reader might spot the flaw. On a phone, the risk jumps. The address bar often shortens URLs, and the screen leaves little room for close inspection. That is exactly where attackers want you. Once trust is established, you are more likely to enter passwords, approve fake invoices or download harmful attachments.",

The faster you act, the less likely you are to notice the mistake.",
      "Why these fake domains keep working",
      "Most people do not slow down to read URLs character by character. Familiar logos and language reinforce trust, especially during a busy workday. Mobile use makes this worse. Smaller screens, shortened links and constant notifications create perfect conditions for mistakes. This is not a Microsoft-only problem. Banks, retailers, healthcare portals and government services all face the same risk.",
      "How to stay safe from typosquatting attacks",
      "Typosquatting scams work because they rush you into trusting what looks familiar. These steps slow that moment down and help you spot fake domains before damage is done.",
      "Before clicking anything, open the full sender address in the email header. Display names and logos are easy to fake, but domains tell the real story. Look closely for swapped letters like rn in place of m, added hyphens or strange domain endings. If the address feels even slightly off, treat the message as hostile.",

      "On a desktop, hover your mouse over links to reveal the real destination. On a phone, long-press the link to preview the URL. This simple pause often exposes lookalike domains designed to steal logins. If the link does not match the exact site you expect, do not proceed.",
      "When an email claims your account needs urgent action, do not use its links. Instead, open a new browser tab and manually go to the official website using a saved bookmark. Legitimate companies do not require you to act through surprise links, and this habit cuts off most typosquatting attempts instantly.",
      "Strong antivirus software can block known phishing domains, flag malicious downloads and warn you before you enter credentials on risky sites. While it cannot catch every new typo trick, it adds an important safety net when human attention slips.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Recently, the company updated its behavior guidelines for users under 18 and released new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. The move comes as pressure mounts across the tech industry. Lawmakers, educators and child safety advocates want proof that AI companies can protect young users.

      "OpenAI announced tougher safety rules for teen users as pressure grows on tech companies to prove AI can protect young people online. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What OpenAI's new teen rules actually say",
      "OpenAI's updated Model Spec builds on existing safety limits and applies to teen users ages 13 to 17. It continues to block sexual content involving minors and discourages self-harm, delusions and manic behavior. For teens, the rules go further. The models must avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and violent or sexual roleplay, even when non-graphic. They must use extra caution when discussing body image and eating behaviors. When safety risks appear, the chatbot should prioritize protection over user autonomy. It should also avoid giving advice that helps teens hide risky behavior from caregivers. These limits apply even if a prompt is framed as fictional, historical, or educational.",
      "The four principles OpenAI says it uses to protect teens",
      "OpenAI says its approach to teen users follows four core principles:",
      "Put teen safety first, even when it limits freedomEncourage real-world support from family, friends, or professionalsSpeak with warmth and respect without treating teens like adultsBe transparent and remind users that the AI is not human",

      "The company updated its chatbot guidelines for users ages 13 to 17 and launched new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Teens are driving the AI safety debate",
      "Gen Z users are among the most active chatbot users today. Many rely on AI for homework help, creative projects and emotional support. OpenAI's recent deal with Disney could draw even more young users to the platform. That growing popularity has also brought scrutiny. Recently, attorneys general from 42 states urged major tech companies to add stronger safeguards for children and vulnerable users. At the federal level, proposed legislation could go even further. Some lawmakers want to block minors from using AI chatbots entirely.",
      "Why experts question whether AI safety rules work",
      "Despite the updates, many experts remain cautious. One major concern is engagement. Advocates argue chatbots often encourage prolonged interaction, which can become addictive for teens. Refusing certain requests could help break that cycle. Still, critics warn that examples in policy documents are not proof of consistent behavior. Past versions of the Model Spec banned excessive agreeableness, yet models continued mirroring users in harmful ways. Some experts link this behavior to what they call AI psychosis, where chatbots reinforce distorted thinking instead of challenging it.",
      "In one widely reported case, a teenager who later died by suicide spent months interacting with a chatbot. Conversation logs showed repeated mirroring and validation of distress. Internal systems flagged hundreds of messages related to self-harm. Yet the interactions continued. Former safety researchers later explained that earlier moderation systems reviewed content after the fact rather than in real time. That allowed harmful conversations to continue unchecked. OpenAI says it now uses real-time classifiers across text, images, and audio. When systems detect serious risk, trained reviewers may step in, and parents may be notified.",
      "Some advocates praise OpenAI for publicly sharing its under-18 guidelines. Many tech companies do not offer that level of transparency. Still, experts stress that written rules are not enough. What matters is how the system behaves during real conversations with vulnerable users. Without independent measurement and clear enforcement data, critics say these updates remain promises rather than proof.",

Still, policies on paper are not the same as behavior in real conversations. For teens who rely on AI every day, what matters most is how these systems respond in moments of stress, confusion, or vulnerability. That is where trust is built or lost. For parents, this moment calls for balance. AI tools can be helpful and creative. They also require guidance, boundaries, and supervision. No set of controls can replace real conversations or human support. As AI becomes more embedded in our everyday lives, the focus must stay on outcomes, not intentions. Protecting teens will depend on consistent enforcement, independent oversight, and active family involvement.",

      "Kurt 'The Cyber Guy' Knutsson shares his tips and tricks to avoid holiday shopping scams this winter season on 'Fox Report.'",
      "Data breaches tied to financial services companies are no longer rare, but they still hit harder when Social Security numbers are involved. In the latest incident, U.S.-based fintech company 700Credit has confirmed that the personal data of more than 5.8 million people was exposed. The breach did not originate from a direct compromise of 700Credit's internal network, which makes it more concerning. It began with a third-party integration partner and quietly snowballed over several months before it was detected. By the time the issue was contained, hackers had managed to steal a significant amount of sensitive consumer data.",

      "A data breach at fintech firm 700Credit exposed the personal information of more than 5.8 million people after hackers accessed data through a third-party vendor. (Photo by Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What went wrong at 700Credit",
      "The company says the breach traces back to July, when a threat actor compromised one of its third-party integration partners, as reported by Bleeping Computer. During that intrusion, the attacker discovered an exposed API that could be used to access customer information linked to 700Credit's dealership clients. The integration partner failed to inform 700Credit about the compromise, allowing the access to continue unnoticed.",
      "Suspicious activity was only detected on October 25, when 700Credit flagged unusual behavior on its systems and launched an internal investigation. The company says it brought in third-party computer forensic specialists to assess the scope of the incident and determine what data had been affected.",
      "According to the company's findings, certain records within its web application were copied without authorization. These records are related to customers of auto dealerships that use 700Credit's services. Managing Director Ken Hill later confirmed that roughly 20% of the consumer data accessible through the affected system was stolen between May and October.",
      "What data was exposed and why it matters",
      "While 700Credit has not published an exhaustive list of every data field involved, the company has confirmed that highly sensitive personal information was exposed. This includes Social Security numbers, which significantly raises the risk of identity theft and financial fraud. When SSNs are compromised, the impact is long-term. You cannot simply change them like a password.",
      "The company has published a dedicated page on its website outlining the breach and the types of information impacted. As part of its response, 700Credit is offering affected individuals 12 months of free identity protection and credit monitoring through TransUnion. You have a 90-day window to enroll in this service after receiving the notification.",
      "Notably, audio streaming platform SoundCloud and adult video sharing platform Pornhub also suffered data breaches tied to third-party vendors. There is no indication that the same vendor was involved in all three incidents, but the cases highlight how risky third-party access can be when vendors handle sensitive consumer data.",

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

When third-party partners fail to disclose breaches quickly, the downstream impact can be massive, as this case shows. If you receive a notification from 700Credit, take it seriously. Enroll in the credit monitoring service, review your credit reports, and consider locking them down. Even if no fraud has occurred yet, breaches involving SSNs often lead to delayed abuse months or even years later.",

      "Data from Happy Returns, a UPS-owned reverse logistics company, shows that nearly one in every 10 retail returns in the United States involves fraud. Retailers now lose an estimated $76.5 billion a year to the problem.",
      "To slow those losses, Happy Returns, which specializes in boxless in-store returns for online purchases, is testing a new artificial intelligence tool that flags fraudulent returns before refunds go out.",

      "Return fraud is costing U.S. retailers billions, with nearly 1 in 10 returns flagged as suspicious, according to data from Happy Returns. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",
      "How return fraud works in the real world",
      "Return fraud often looks harmless on the surface. A shopper requests a refund for a legitimate item. Instead of sending back the real product, they ship something cheaper, damaged or completely different. Retailers often issue refunds before anyone inspects the item. That speed allows fraud to slip through and drives up costs.",
      "Industry data from Happy Returns and the National Retail Federation shows retailers will handle nearly $850 billion in returned goods in 2025, representing almost 16% of total retail sales. According to the same research, an estimated 9% of those returns are fraudulent. The report also finds that many shoppers admit to some form of return policy abuse. Importantly, because Happy Returns conducts in-person item verification and uses AI-powered automated flagging plus audit processes to catch mismatches, the rate of confirmed fraud in its network is much lower than the industry-wide estimate.",
      "Why boxless returns changed the equation",
      "Happy Returns operates nearly 8,000 in-person return drop-off locations inside stores such as Ulta Beauty and Staples, as well as at UPS locations. Shoppers can return eligible items without a box or shipping label, and refunds are often issued quickly after verification. Like any returns channel, fraud attempts can happen, but in-person drop-off, item verification, ongoing flagging and audits help keep confirmed fraud far lower than broader industry averages.",
      "Happy Returns says its boxless, in-person model already blocks many common fraud tactics, including empty boxes, partial returns and fake tracking numbers.\u00a0\"If you never touch the product, you can't actually know what's being returned matches what was sold,\" the company says. Everlane says that physical handling alone acts as a deterrent. \"Just the fact of knowing an individual will physically handle and verify the product at the Return Bar deters fraudsters from even attempting to commit fraud,\" said Jim Green, director of logistics and fulfillment at Everlane.",
      "Still, Happy Returns acknowledges that fraud tactics continue to evolve. Lookalike products and knockoffs can closely resemble the real thing, making subtle differences hard to spot without close inspection.",

      "How Return Vision uses AI to detect fraudulent returns",
      "This holiday season, Happy Returns is piloting its new AI system with select retailers, including Everlane, Revolve and Under Armour, as return volumes spike.",
      "The new AI tool is called Return Vision. It starts working the moment a shopper initiates a return online. The system looks for unusual patterns across return timing, frequency and location. A single return may appear normal on its own. When those signals overlap in suspicious ways, the return is flagged for review before a refund is issued.",
      "At drop-off points, workers can scan item barcodes and see photos of what the item should look like. They can reject obvious mismatches on the spot. Once returns reach Happy Returns hubs in California, Pennsylvania and Mississippi, flagged packages are sent to human auditors. The items are opened and photographed, including images of the front, back and identifying labels.",
      "Those photos are fed back into the AI system, which compares them against official product images and past transaction data. Human teams review the AI assessment and make the final decision. The goal is not automation alone. It is adding multiple layers of review where fraud is harder to hide.",
      "Early results show how effective AI is at catching return fraud",
      "While still in pilot, Happy Returns says Return Vision is showing early results. Less than 1% of returns flowing through its network are flagged as high risk. Of those flagged returns, about 10% are ultimately confirmed as fraud. The average prevented loss per confirmed case is just over $200.",
      "Happy Returns says the system focuses on high-confidence cases, allowing most shoppers to move through returns without delay. The company notes that the tool does not address every form of abuse, such as wardrobing, when customers return worn items.",

      "Boxless, in-person returns are helping retailers cut down on common fraud tactics like empty boxes and fake tracking numbers. (Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why retailers are turning to AI to stop return fraud",
      "Happy Returns is not alone in turning to AI to stop return fraud. Amazon and FedEx both offer boxless returns and use automated systems to flag risky behavior. The U.S. Postal Service is rolling out similar services. Across retail, 85% of surveyed merchants say they use AI or machine learning to combat fraud. Many say the results have been mixed.

The company stated it found no evidence that the data was taken during its November 2025 breach. Pornhub has also clarified that it stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021.

Instead of scrolling through endless playlists, you can ask ChatGPT to create one using natural language. For example, you can request a holiday mix without overplayed songs or ask it to find a track you only half remember. ChatGPT searches Apple Music and builds the playlist for you. This integration does not stream full songs inside ChatGPT. It helps Apple Music subscribers find music, create playlists and discover artists faster, then links back to Apple Music for listening.

In 1999, retired FBI agent S\u00e9amus McElearney says the Bureau finally cracked the organization from the inside by flipping a violent mob soldier and triggering a chain reaction that dismantled the family.",
      "McElearney, author of the recently released \"Flipping Capo: How the FBI Dismantled the Real Sopranos,\" joined the FBI in 1998 and was assigned to Squad C-10 of the New York Organized Crime Branch, where he investigated both the Bonanno and DeCavalcante crime families, the real-life inspiration behind \"The Sopranos.\"",

      "\"When you have a proactive witness, the most important thing is trying to keep him safe,\" McElearney said. \"You have to have him think to the criminals that he\u2019s still not cooperating with the government.\"",

      "The investigation reached a breaking point in December 1999, when McElearney led the arrest of Anthony Capo, a feared DeCavalcante soldier with a long reputation for violence and hostility toward law enforcement.",
      "\"I was assigned to arrest a violent DeCavalcante soldier named Anthony Capo,\" McElearney said. \"He had a notorious reputation against law enforcement and even within the mob itself.\"",
      "Before his cooperation, Capo had been deeply embedded in the family\u2019s bloodiest chapters. According to historical accounts, Capo was involved in the 1989 murder of Fred Weiss, a hit ordered by Gambino boss John Gotti to solidify the DeCavalcante family\u2019s standing with New York\u2019s Mafia elite. Capo helped monitor Weiss and served as the driver during the Staten Island ambush, highlighting the depth of his involvement in mob violence before he ever cooperated.",

      "Rather than intimidation, McElearney said he relied on relentless preparation and respect, what he calls \"mind chess.\"",
      "\"I basically studied him like you would study for a test. I knew everything about him,\" McElearney said. \"I knew where he lived. I knew his kids\u2019 names. I even knew he was diabetic.\"",
      "During the arrest, McElearney made sure Capo\u2019s blood sugar wouldn\u2019t drop.",

      "\"To tell you the truth, I had no idea at all,\" McElearney said. \"I was totally stunned.\"",
      "Capo became the first made member in the DeCavalcante family\u2019s century-long history to cooperate with law enforcement, a move that shattered mafia tradition and triggered a historic domino effect.",

      "The violence Capo once participated in was also turning inward. Historical accounts show that Capo\u2019s associate Joey Garofano disappeared after mishandling aspects of the Weiss hit. He is believed to have been killed by fellow mobsters who feared he might expose them, reflecting the paranoia consuming the family.",
      "Capo was also tied to the killing of acting boss John D\u2019Amato in the early 1990s, an internal execution driven by power struggles and rumors that further fractured the family\u2019s already fragile code of loyalty.",

Over the following years, McElearney and his team secured 71 convictions, solved 11 murders and put seven trials before federal juries, effectively dismantling the DeCavalcante crime family.",
      "The cooperation allowed prosecutors to do something almost unheard of: put the entire structure of a mafia family on the witness stand, from street associates to leadership.",

      "\"That recording was priceless for trial,\" he said. \"All we had to do was hit play.\"",
      "But the reality behind the show was far darker. McElearney described one of the Bureau\u2019s most chilling recordings, a shooter calmly describing the execution of Joseph Conigliaro, a ruthless mob associate who used a wheelchair.",
      "\"He was shot six times,\" McElearney said. \"He got out of the car, drove away, put his blinker on and drove himself toward the hospital.\"",

      "\"That became very real very quickly,\" McElearney said.",
      "McElearney later went on to oversee investigations into the Colombo crime family, helping dismantle another major mafia organization and spearheading what the FBI has described as the largest mafia takedown in its history. Over his career, he helped convict 10 mafia bosses and solve more than 30 homicides, including 11 tied to the DeCavalcante case and more than 20 linked to Bonanno and Colombo family investigations. In 2013, McElearney was invited to the White House and recognized by the president for his work against organized crime.",

      "His bond was initially set at $15,000, but Judge Joy Kennedy lowered it to $5,000 on Dec. 8. The Bail Project provided the $500 for Allen to be bonded out of the Cuyahoga County Jail. Five days after being released from jail, Allen was arrested for the alleged murder of McComas.",
      "Two family members told Fox News Digital they told The Bail Project that Allen shouldn't be released because he would continue to reoffend and needs professional help or to remain incarcerated. The group ignored their warnings, they said.",
      "\"We knew that he would end up in [jail] anyway, because he does break into people's cars and whatnot. We just, we've always wanted the best for him. Whenever he starts doing good, he self-sabotages and just ends up back in jail. And that's the reason why we felt the need to let them know that they shouldn't post his bail,\" one family member told Fox News Digital. \"I just feel like the whole situation could have been avoided and a life would be living had they listened to what we had to say when they asked.\"",
      "Allen has a lengthy rap sheet which dates back to at least 2019 and includes burglary, assault on a peace officer, resting arrest and more.",
      "Allen's attorney, James Jenkins, previously told Fox News Digital that the Dec. 14 alleged murder was \"far from\" an intentional homicide.",

      "Samuel Lee Scott",

      "Samuel Lee Scott was arrested in April 2019 in St. Louis, Missouri, after he hit his wife, 54-year-old Marcia Johnson, in the face and threatened to \"finish what (he) started\" in January. Scott was charged with misdemeanor domestic assault charge, and The Bail Project posted his $5,000 bail on April 9.",

      "Scott was charged with first-degree murder in relation to Johnson's death. He had previous convictions for assault and drug charges. Scott was found guilty of murdering his wife in 2022 and sentenced to life without parole.",
      "The Bail Project's Executive Director Robin Steinberg previously said in a statement that while the organization was \"deeply saddened\" with Johnson's death, blame shouldn't be directed towards the group.",
      "\"No one could have predicted this tragedy,\" Steinberg said in a statement. \"It's important to remember that had he been wealthy enough to afford his bail, or bonded out by a commercial bail bond agency, he would have been free pretrial as well. In times like this, we must come together for this family and keep sight of the need to transform the larger systems that create poverty, racism and violence, including the pretrial bail system.\"",
      "Marcus Garvin",
      "Marcus Garvin pleaded guilty to murdering his girlfriend, Christie Holt. (Indianapolis Police Department)",
      "Marcus Garvin was initially arrested after he was charged with battery for an incident in December 2020 where he allegedly stabbed a customer at an Indianapolis Circle K convenience store, according to WRTV.",

      "Wilfred Reilly speaks with Fox News Digital about his book, \"Lies My Liberal Teacher Told Me,\" in December 2025. (Fox News Digital)",

      "\"So, I actually responded to what we're actually learning by looking through these guys, like the 1619 curriculum, and kind of focusing on what they got wrong from the left,\" said Reilly.",
      "In the case of slavery, Reilly noted that modern educators are teaching only a sliver of the whole story.",
      "\"What we're teaching is a focus on kind of the latter part of the Atlantic slave trade, which was one of about 20 global slave trades,\" he said. \"And the reason that we're teaching this is because it allows the pedagogue, the professor or the teacher, a chance to segue into the modern oppression of Black people. That's it. That's why that's a focus.\"",

      "\"I think the current presentation of Native Americans would be that they were peaceful, Gaia-worshiping people who were intentionally exterminated by the Europeans, and that's fantastically false,\" said Reilly.",
      "\"The Natives were people who had their own motivations, incentives, and drives, and who often competed very successfully with the Europeans,\" he continued. \"They were also some of the greatest warriors in history, especially the Plains Indians, on par with the Mongols. The Indian Wars took 400 years. The United States is 2% Native today. I mean, so the depiction is just completely factually false.\"",

      "China will begin charging a 13% value-added tax on contraceptives starting Jan. 1 while exempting childcare services from the same tax, a move authorities say is part of a broader effort to boost births as the country faces a sustained population decline, according to the BBC and The Associated Press.",
      "The tax overhaul, announced late last year, removes exemptions that had been in place since 1994, when China was still enforcing its decades-long one-child policy.",
      "Alongside the new tax on contraceptives such as condoms and birth control pills, the Chinese government is exempting childcare, marriage-related services and elderly care from the value-added tax (VAT), the BBC reported.",
      "Beijing has been pressing young people to marry and have children as it grapples with an aging population and a sluggish economy. Official figures show China\u2019s population has shrunk for three consecutive years with about 9.54 million babies born in 2024.",

      "That figure is roughly half the number of births recorded a decade earlier, when China began easing limits on family size, according to national statistics cited by the BBC and the AP.",
      "China\u2019s population pressures have been mounting for years. Births fell from about 14.7 million in 2019 to roughly 9.5 million in 2024. In 2023, India officially overtook China as the world\u2019s most populous country.",
      "The new tax on contraceptives has drawn ridicule and concern inside China. On social media, some users joked about stockpiling condoms before prices rise, while others argued that the cost of contraception is insignificant compared with the expense of raising a child, the BBC reported.",
      "\"I have one child, and I don\u2019t want any more,\" Daniel Luo, a 36-year-old resident of Henan province, told the BBC. He said the price increase would not change his family plans, comparing it to small hikes in subway fares that do not alter daily behavior.",
      "Others worry the policy could have unintended consequences. Rosy Zhao, who lives in the central city of Xi\u2019an, told the BBC making contraception more expensive could lead students or people under financial strain to take risks.

      "China reversed its controversial one-child policy in 2015. (Adek Berry)",
      "Health experts echoed those concerns in interviews with the AP, warning that higher prices could reduce access to contraception and contribute to more unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. China recorded more than 670,000 cases of syphilis and over 100,000 cases of gonorrhea in 2024, according to data from the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration.",
      "China has also reported some of the highest abortion numbers in the world. Between 2014 and 2021, authorities recorded between 9 million and 10 million abortions annually, according to the National Health Commission. China stopped publishing abortion data in 2022.",
      "Demographers and policy analysts remain skeptical that taxing contraceptives will meaningfully raise birth rates. Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, told the BBC the idea that higher condom prices would influence fertility decisions amounts to overthinking the policy.",
      "Value-added tax revenue, which totaled close to $1 trillion last year, accounts for about 40% of China\u2019s tax collection, according to figures cited by the BBC.",
      "Henrietta Levin of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) described the move as symbolic, reflecting Beijing\u2019s attempt to lift what she called strikingly low fertility numbers. She also cautioned that many incentives and subsidies depend on provincial governments that are already heavily indebted, raising questions about whether they can fund the measures adequately.",

      "Public health experts interviewed by the AP said the policy could disproportionately affect women, who shoulder most responsibility for birth control in China. Research released by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2022 found condoms are used by about 9% of couples, while 44.2% rely on intrauterine devices and 30.5% on female sterilization. Male sterilization accounts for 4.7%.",
      "Some women say the tax revives resentment toward the government\u2019s long history of involvement in reproductive decisions. The Communist Party enforced the one-child policy from roughly 1980 until 2015 through fines, penalties and, in some cases, forced abortions, according to the AP. Children born outside the policy were sometimes denied household registration, effectively rendering them non-citizens.",
      "\"It is a disciplinary tactic, a management of women\u2019s bodies and my sexual desire,\" Zou Xuan, a 32-year-old teacher in Jiangxi province, told the AP.",
      "Concerns about further state intrusion have also surfaced in recent months. The BBC reported that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about menstrual cycles and pregnancy plans. A health bureau in Yunnan province said the information was needed to identify expectant mothers, a move critics say risks alienating the very families Beijing hopes to encourage.",

    "summary": "Alaska\u2019s courts spent more than a year building an AI chatbot to help with probate, revealing how difficult it is to deploy AI in government services.",
    "story": [
      "Dealing with a loved one\u2019s belongings after their death is never easy. But as Alaska\u2019s state courts have discovered, an inaccurate or misleading artificial intelligence chatbot can easily make matters worse.",
      "For more than a year, Alaska\u2019s court system has been designing a pioneering generative AI chatbot termed the Alaska Virtual Assistant (AVA) to help residents navigate the tangled web of forms and procedures involved in probate, the judicial process of transferring property away from a deceased person.",
      "Yet what was meant to be a quick, AI-powered leap forward in increasing access to justice has spiraled into a protracted, yearlong journey plagued by false starts and false answers.",
      "AVA \u201cwas supposed to be a three-month project,\u201d said Aubrie Souza, a consultant with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) who has worked on and witnessed AVA\u2019s evolution. \u201cWe are now at well over a year and three months, but that\u2019s all because of the due diligence that was required to get it right.\u201d",
      "Designing this bespoke AI solution has illuminated the difficulties government agencies across the United States are facing in applying powerful AI systems to real-world problems where truth and reliability are paramount.",
      "\u201cWith a project like this, we need to be 100% accurate, and that\u2019s really difficult with this technology,\u201d said Stacey Marz, the administrative director of the Alaska Court System and one of the AVA project\u2019s leaders.",
      "\u201cI joke with my staff on other technology projects that we can\u2019t expect these systems to be perfect, otherwise we\u2019d never be able to roll them out. Once we get the minimum viable product, let\u2019s get that out there, and then we\u2019ll enhance that as we learn.\u201d",
      "But Marz said she thinks this chatbot should be held to a higher standard. \u201cIf people are going to take the information they get from their prompt and they\u2019re going to act on it and it\u2019s not accurate or not complete, they really could suffer harm. It could be incredibly damaging to that person, family or estate.\u201d",
      "While many local government agencies are experimenting with AI tools for use cases ranging from helping residents apply for a driver\u2019s license to speeding up municipal employees\u2019 ability to process housing benefits, a recent Deloitte report found that less than 6% of local government practitioners were prioritizing AI as a tool to deliver services.",
      "The AVA experience demonstrates the barriers government agencies face in attempting to leverage AI for increased efficiency or better service, including concerns about reliability and trustworthiness in high-stakes contexts, along with questions about the role of human oversight given fast-changing AI systems. These limitations clash with today\u2019s rampant AI hype and could help explain larger discrepancies between booming AI investment and limited AI adoption.",
      "Marz envisioned the AVA project as a cutting-edge, low-cost version of Alaska\u2019s family law helpline, which is staffed by court employees and provides free guidance about legal matters ranging from divorce to domestic violence protective orders.",
      "\u201cOur goal was to basically try to replicate the services with the chatbot that we would provide with a human facilitator,\u201d Marz told NBC News, referring to AVA\u2019s team of attorneys, technical experts and advisers from the NCSC. \u201cWe wanted a similar self-help experience, if somebody was able to talk to you and say, \u2018This is what I need help with, this is my situation.\u2019\u201d",
      "While the NCSC provided an initial grant to get AVA off the ground as part of its growing work on AI, the chatbot has been technically developed by Tom Martin, a lawyer and law professor who launched a law-focused AI company called LawDroid and designs legal AI tools.",
      "Describing the AVA service, Martin highlighted many critical decisions and considerations that go into the design process, such as choosing and shaping an AI system\u2019s personality.",
      "Many commentators and researchers have illustrated how certain models or versions of AI systems behave in different ways, almost as if they adopt different personas. Researchers and even users can alter these personas through technical tweaks, as many ChatGPT users found out earlier this year when the OpenAI service fluctuated between personalities that were either gushing and sycophantic or emotionally distant. Other models, like xAI\u2019s Grok, are known for having looser guardrails and increased willingness to embrace controversial topics.",
      "\u201cDifferent models have almost different types of personalities,\u201d Martin told NBC News. \u201cSome of them are very good at rule-following, while others are not as good at following rules and kind of want to prove that they\u2019re the smartest guy in the room.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor a legal application, you don\u2019t want that,\u201d Martin said. \u201cYou want it to be rule-following but smart and able to explain itself in plain language.\u201d",
      "Even traits that would otherwise be welcomed become more problematic when applied to topics as consequential as probate. Working with Martin, NCSC\u2019s Souza noted that early versions of AVA were too empathetic and annoyed users who might have been actively grieving and simply wanted answers about the probate process: \u201cThrough our user testing, everyone said, \u2018I\u2019m tired of everybody in my life telling me that they\u2019re sorry for my loss.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cSo we basically removed those kinds of condolences, because from an AI chatbot, you don\u2019t need one more,\u201d Souza said.",
      "Beyond the system\u2019s superficial tone and pleasantries, Martin and Souza had to contend with the serious issue of hallucinations, or instances in which AI systems confidently share false or exaggerated information.",
      "\u201cWe had trouble with hallucinations, regardless of the model, where the chatbot was not supposed to actually use anything outside of its knowledge base,\u201d Souza told NBC News. \u201cFor example, when we asked it, \u2018Where do I get legal help?\u2019 it would tell you, \u2018There\u2019s a law school in Alaska, and so look at the alumni network.\u2019 But there is no law school in Alaska.\u201d",
      "Martin has worked extensively to ensure the chatbot only references the relevant areas of the Alaska Court System\u2019s probate documents rather than conducting wider web searches.",
      "Across the AI industry, AI hallucinations have decreased over time and present less of a threat today than they did even several months ago. Many companies building AI applications like AI-agent provider Manus, which was recently acquired by Meta for more than $2 billion, stress the reliability of their services and include several layers of AI-powered verification to ensure their results are accurate.",
      "To evaluate the accuracy and helpfulness of AVA\u2019s responses, the AVA team designed a set of 91 questions regarding probate topics, asking the chatbot, for example, which probate form would be appropriate to submit if a user wanted to transfer the title of their deceased relative\u2019s car to their name.",
      "Yet the 91-question test proved too time-consuming to run and evaluate, according to Jeannie Sato, the Alaska Court System\u2019s director of access to justice services, given the stakes at hand and the need for human review.",
      "So Sato said the team landed on a refined list of just 16 test questions, featuring \u201csome questions that AVA had answered incorrectly, some that were complicated, and some that were pretty basic questions that we think AVA may be asked frequently.\u201d",
      "Cost is another critical issue for Sato and the AVA team. New iterations and versions of AI systems have caused usage fees to fall precipitously, which the AVA team sees as a key advantage of AI tools given limited court budgets.",
      "Martin told NBC News that under one technical setup, 20 AVA queries would cost only about 11 cents. \u201cI\u2019m mission-driven, and it\u2019s about impact for me in helping people in the world,\u201d Martin said. \u201cTo be able to carry forward with that mission, of course, cost is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Yet the ever-changing and advancing systems that power AVA\u2019s answers, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT family of models, mean that the administrative team will likely have to continuously and regularly monitor AVA for any behavioral or accuracy changes.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate needing to do regular checks and potentially update prompts or the models as new ones come out and others are retired. It\u2019s definitely something we\u2019ll need to stay on top of rather than a purely hands-off situation,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Despite its many fits and starts, AVA is now scheduled to be launched in late January, if all goes according to plan. For her part, Marz remains optimistic about AVA\u2019s potential to help Alaskans access the probate system but is more clear-eyed about AI\u2019s current limits.",
      "\u201cWe did shift our goals on this project a little bit,\u201d Marz said. \u201cWe wanted to replicate what our human facilitators at the self-help center are able to share with people. But we\u2019re not confident that the bots can work in that fashion, because of the issues with some inaccuracies and some incompleteness. But maybe with increasing model updates, that will change, and the accuracy levels will go up and the completeness will go up.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was just so very labor-intensive to do this,\u201d Marz added, despite \u201call the buzz about generative AI, and everybody saying this is going to revolutionize self-help and democratize access to the courts. It\u2019s quite a big challenge to actually pull that off."

    "summary": "A study aims to identify the possible link between calcium deposits in women's breast arteries and life-threatening heart risks.",
    "story": [
      "Nancy Preston didn\u2019t have a heart attack. Nor did she have chest discomfort, shortness of breath or heart palpitations \u2014 all symptoms of heart disease. Instead, a routine mammogram led to  Preston having quintuple bypass surgery last summer.",
      "\u201cIt was just something horrible waiting to happen,\u201d said the 67-year-old from New York City. \u201cI did not have symptoms, except for feeling a little more fatigued than usual, which I attributed to age.\u201d",
      "Preston does have a family history of heart disease. Her mother had a heart attack and a double bypass, and an older sister had a heart attack and has a pacemaker.",
      "Even so, heart disease wasn\u2019t top of mind for Preston, a yoga enthusiast who exercised daily and followed a healthy diet. Her high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes \u2014 two conditions that can increase a person\u2019s odds of developing heart disease \u2014 had been under control before her health scare, she said.",
      "In October 2024, Preston got her annual mammogram at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Doctors detected breast arterial calcifications, or BAC, on Preston\u2019s mammogram.",
      "What are breast arterial calcifications?",
      "Breast arterial calcifications are calcium buildups within the breast arteries that may be associated with heart disease. Mount Sinai is conducting a behavioral study to understand how women react to being notified about the arterial calcifications with their mammogram results.",
      "After Preston, who is participating in the study, was notified of her breast arterial calcification, she underwent a cardiac stress test, which monitors the heart during physical exertion.",
      "\u201cIn [Preston\u2019s] case, her heart function was very strong at rest, but during the stress portion, part of her heart muscle was not squeezing appropriately,\u201d said Dr. Mary Ann McLaughlin, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital. \u201cHer results indicated multivessel coronary artery disease.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin and Preston believe the BAC findings saved her life.",
      "\u201cThe only reason that Nancy went ahead with a stress test was because she was a participant in the study,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cIf she had come to me with what she had, which was well-controlled risk factors and no symptoms, I likely would not have referred her for the stress test.\u201d",
      "Preston continues to recover from the major surgery she had in July. \u201cThank God this BAC was shared with me,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends women ages 40 through 74 get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer. While federal law mandates that certain information, such as breast density, be included in mammography reports, providers don\u2019t have to mention breast arterial calcifications.",
      "Dr. Laurie Margolies, chief of breast imaging at the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and a leader of the study, hopes to change that.",
      "\u201cIn over 10% of mammograms, you will see calcified arteries, and people are always surprised,\u201d said Margolies, who has been studying the relationship between breast arterial calcification and heart disease for about a decade. \u201cWhen the arteries are calcified in a woman\u2019s breast, it only makes logical sense that vessels might be calcified elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Breast arterial calcifications, which are specific to breast arteries, are different from the calcifications common to other areas of the breast. Macrocalcifications, which appear as white dots on a mammogram, are typically benign, according to the National Cancer Institute. Microcalcifications appear as white specks and may indicate cancer in some cases. About half of women develop benign breast calcifications.",
      "The Mount Sinai study, which began recruiting patients 40 and older in 2021, aims to analyze BAC rates in a diverse sample of 14,875 women. Margolies estimates 12.5% of women in the health system have breast arterial calcifications, including those with known heart conditions.",
      "The second part of the study randomly splits 1,888 patients with breast arterial calcifications into two groups. Women in the first group are notified of their results, educated about heart disease risk and encouraged to consult a preventive cardiologist. Women in the second group receive a standard mammography letter, then are notified of their BAC readings six months later.",
      "Results are expected in early 2027.",
      "How breast screening helps detect heart disease",
      "A 2018 review published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging advocated for mammography as a screening tool for heart disease. A 2022 study published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging found an association between breast arterial calcification and heart disease in postmenopausal women ages 60 to 79, while 2024 research published in the journal JACC: Advances noted that BAC was \u201cespecially predictive\u201d of heart disease in younger women ages 40 to 59.",
      "Dr. Naomi Ko, section chief of breast medical oncology at NYU Langone Health, said the Mount Sinai study adds to a growing body of evidence that cardiovascular disease clues lie in the breasts.",
      "In some cases, women may be able to improve their heart health through behavioral and medication changes to stave off more serious medical intervention.",
      "\u201cGive me an opportunity to counsel my patients toward better lifestyle choices, and I\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Ko, who isn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cIf it triggers and influences improved health behaviors and engagement positively in your health care, awesome.\u201d",
      "The budding link between breast arterial calcification, also called vascular calcification, and heart disease is just that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a slam dunk,\u201d Ko said. More research is needed, and women shouldn\u2019t panic if they learn they have BAC.",
      "\u201cWe know these calcifications are associated with cardiovascular challenges, but we\u2019re not 100% certain about what that could mean for every single individual patient,\u201d Ko said. \u201cThis is one data point about your body.\u201d",
      "Mammogram findings should prompt discussions about both a patient\u2019s heart and breast health, said Dr. Melanie Chellman, a Cleveland Clinic breast radiologist who isn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "\u201cThe great thing about mammograms is that we\u2019re already doing them on the particular women who are at the highest risk for heart disease: ages 40 and older,\u201d Chellman said. \u201cWe can use those same pictures to look for calcifications that are vascular.\u201d",
      "Dr. Steven Isakoff, co-clinical director of breast oncology at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute, said educating health care providers is as big a hurdle as informing patients.",
      "\u201cMost of my colleagues, I would bet, are not aware of the association between breast arterial calcifications [and heart disease],\u201d said Isakoff, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cWithout more specific guidance in the report about what steps to take, I would think it might not get acted upon.\u201d",
      "More research is needed to define how much arterial calcification in the breast may be cause for concern, he said. Meanwhile, he praised Mount Sinai\u2019s efforts to fill in gaps in the data.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of information buried in mammograms,\u201d Isakoff said."

    "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:15:00 GMT",
    "summary": "NASA's MAVEN spacecraft, which has orbited Mars since 2014, went quiet abruptly in early December. Efforts to reestablish a connection have been unsuccessful.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly a month, NASA has been scrambling to make contact with a spacecraft in orbit around Mars that abruptly fell silent.",
      "The space agency lost communication with the MAVEN probe (short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) on Dec. 6, and efforts to re-establish a connection have been futile. Based on bits of data received that day, mission controllers think the probe was spinning unexpectedly.",
      "NASA now has to wait until Jan. 16 before it can again try to revive MAVEN, because Mars and Earth have been on opposite sides of the sun since Monday, resulting in a prolonged communications blackout.",
      "Overall, it\u2019s not looking promising for one of NASA\u2019s workhorse missions.",
      "Since the MAVEN spacecraft entered orbit around Mars in 2014, it has been studying the red planet\u2019s upper atmosphere, including a plasma layer known as the ionosphere, and investigating how and why Mars has been losing its atmosphere over billions of years. The spacecraft has also been instrumental in relaying communications between two rovers on the surface of Mars, Curiosity and Perseverance, and Earth.",
      "NASA hasn\u2019t been able to reach MAVEN since it experienced what the agency called a \u201closs of signal\u201d with ground stations on Earth on Dec. 6. At the time, the spacecraft was orbiting behind Mars, so the signal loss was routine and expected, as Mars always blocks MAVEN from phoning home during the maneuver. This time, however, when the probe re-emerged from behind the red planet, NASA could not pick up any signals from it.",
      "NASA said it was \u201cinvestigating the anomaly\u201d in a statement on Dec. 9 but provided few details. Mission controllers reported that all of MAVEN\u2019s subsystems had been working normally before it passed behind Mars.",
      "In an update about a week later, NASA said no transmissions had been received from MAVEN since Dec. 4, but that engineers had recovered a brief fragment of tracking data from Dec. 6.",
      "What they found was troubling: \u201cAnalysis of that signal suggests that the MAVEN spacecraft was rotating in an unexpected manner when it emerged from behind Mars,\u201d NASA officials said in a statement.",
      "The space agency has been using a global array of giant radio antennas, known as the Deep Space Network, to send commands to MAVEN and monitor for any incoming signals. On Dec. 16 and 20, NASA tried snapping photos of MAVEN in orbit from the surface of Mars, using an instrument aboard the agency\u2019s Curiosity rover.",
      "At the same time, mission controllers are closely analyzing the last fragments of tracking data recovered. NASA said on Dec. 23 that it was attempting to piece together a timeline of events to figure out what went wrong. NASA did not provide additional details in a request for comment and referred NBC News to the agency\u2019s update on Dec. 23.",
      "The MAVEN mission was originally designed to last just two years, but it has been operating continuously for more than a decade. In 2024, NASA celebrated the probe\u2019s 10th anniversary orbiting Mars.",
      "By studying the process of atmospheric loss on Mars, MAVEN was helping scientists get a clearer picture of the planet\u2019s past and present climate and how it transformed from a potentially habitable world with liquid water on its surface to the cold and barren planet that it is today.",
      "The spacecraft is one of three that NASA currently has in orbit around Mars. The space agency also operates the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched in 2005, and Mars Odyssey, which lifted off in 2001."

      "Breast arterial calcifications are calcium buildups within the breast arteries that may be associated with heart disease. Mount Sinai is conducting a behavioral study to understand how women react to being notified about the arterial calcifications with their mammogram results.",
      "After Preston, who is participating in the study, was notified of her breast arterial calcification, she underwent a cardiac stress test, which monitors the heart during physical exertion.",
      "\u201cIn [Preston\u2019s] case, her heart function was very strong at rest, but during the stress portion, part of her heart muscle was not squeezing appropriately,\u201d said Dr. Mary Ann McLaughlin, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital. \u201cHer results indicated multivessel coronary artery disease.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin and Preston believe the BAC findings saved her life.",
      "\u201cThe only reason that Nancy went ahead with a stress test was because she was a participant in the study,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cIf she had come to me with what she had, which was well-controlled risk factors and no symptoms, I likely would not have referred her for the stress test.\u201d",
      "Preston continues to recover from the major surgery she had in July. \u201cThank God this BAC was shared with me,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends women ages 40 through 74 get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer. While federal law mandates that certain information, such as breast density, be included in mammography reports, providers don\u2019t have to mention breast arterial calcifications.",
      "Dr. Laurie Margolies, chief of breast imaging at the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and a leader of the study, hopes to change that.",
      "\u201cIn over 10% of mammograms, you will see calcified arteries, and people are always surprised,\u201d said Margolies, who has been studying the relationship between breast arterial calcification and heart disease for about a decade. \u201cWhen the arteries are calcified in a woman\u2019s breast, it only makes logical sense that vessels might be calcified elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Breast arterial calcifications, which are specific to breast arteries, are different from the calcifications common to other areas of the breast. Macrocalcifications, which appear as white dots on a mammogram, are typically benign, according to the National Cancer Institute. Microcalcifications appear as white specks and may indicate cancer in some cases. About half of women develop benign breast calcifications.",
      "The Mount Sinai study, which began recruiting patients 40 and older in 2021, aims to analyze BAC rates in a diverse sample of 14,875 women. Margolies estimates 12.5% of women in the health system have breast arterial calcifications, including those with known heart conditions.",
      "The second part of the study randomly splits 1,888 patients with breast arterial calcifications into two groups. Women in the first group are notified of their results, educated about heart disease risk and encouraged to consult a preventive cardiologist. Women in the second group receive a standard mammography letter, then are notified of their BAC readings six months later.",
      "Results are expected in early 2027.",
      "How breast screening helps detect heart disease",
      "A 2018 review published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging advocated for mammography as a screening tool for heart disease. A 2022 study published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging found an association between breast arterial calcification and heart disease in postmenopausal women ages 60 to 79, while 2024 research published in the journal JACC: Advances noted that BAC was \u201cespecially predictive\u201d of heart disease in younger women ages 40 to 59.",
      "Dr. Naomi Ko, section chief of breast medical oncology at NYU Langone Health, said the Mount Sinai study adds to a growing body of evidence that cardiovascular disease clues lie in the breasts.",
      "In some cases, women may be able to improve their heart health through behavioral and medication changes to stave off more serious medical intervention.",
      "\u201cGive me an opportunity to counsel my patients toward better lifestyle choices, and I\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Ko, who isn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cIf it triggers and influences improved health behaviors and engagement positively in your health care, awesome.\u201d",
      "The budding link between breast arterial calcification, also called vascular calcification, and heart disease is just that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a slam dunk,\u201d Ko said. More research is needed, and women shouldn\u2019t panic if they learn they have BAC.",
      "\u201cWe know these calcifications are associated with cardiovascular challenges, but we\u2019re not 100% certain about what that could mean for every single individual patient,\u201d Ko said. \u201cThis is one data point about your body.\u201d",
      "Mammogram findings should prompt discussions about both a patient\u2019s heart and breast health, said Dr. Melanie Chellman, a Cleveland Clinic breast radiologist who isn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "\u201cThe great thing about mammograms is that we\u2019re already doing them on the particular women who are at the highest risk for heart disease: ages 40 and older,\u201d Chellman said. \u201cWe can use those same pictures to look for calcifications that are vascular.\u201d",
      "Dr. Steven Isakoff, co-clinical director of breast oncology at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute, said educating health care providers is as big a hurdle as informing patients.",
      "\u201cMost of my colleagues, I would bet, are not aware of the association between breast arterial calcifications [and heart disease],\u201d said Isakoff, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cWithout more specific guidance in the report about what steps to take, I would think it might not get acted upon.\u201d",
      "More research is needed to define how much arterial calcification in the breast may be cause for concern, he said. Meanwhile, he praised Mount Sinai\u2019s efforts to fill in gaps in the data.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of information buried in mammograms,\u201d Isakoff said."

    "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:15:00 GMT",
    "summary": "NASA's MAVEN spacecraft, which has orbited Mars since 2014, went quiet abruptly in early December. Efforts to reestablish a connection have been unsuccessful.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly a month, NASA has been scrambling to make contact with a spacecraft in orbit around Mars that abruptly fell silent.",
      "The space agency lost communication with the MAVEN probe (short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) on Dec. 6, and efforts to re-establish a connection have been futile. Based on bits of data received that day, mission controllers think the probe was spinning unexpectedly.",
      "NASA now has to wait until Jan. 16 before it can again try to revive MAVEN, because Mars and Earth have been on opposite sides of the sun since Monday, resulting in a prolonged communications blackout.",
      "Overall, it\u2019s not looking promising for one of NASA\u2019s workhorse missions.",
      "Since the MAVEN spacecraft entered orbit around Mars in 2014, it has been studying the red planet\u2019s upper atmosphere, including a plasma layer known as the ionosphere, and investigating how and why Mars has been losing its atmosphere over billions of years. The spacecraft has also been instrumental in relaying communications between two rovers on the surface of Mars, Curiosity and Perseverance, and Earth.",
      "NASA hasn\u2019t been able to reach MAVEN since it experienced what the agency called a \u201closs of signal\u201d with ground stations on Earth on Dec. 6. At the time, the spacecraft was orbiting behind Mars, so the signal loss was routine and expected, as Mars always blocks MAVEN from phoning home during the maneuver. This time, however, when the probe re-emerged from behind the red planet, NASA could not pick up any signals from it.",
      "NASA said it was \u201cinvestigating the anomaly\u201d in a statement on Dec. 9 but provided few details. Mission controllers reported that all of MAVEN\u2019s subsystems had been working normally before it passed behind Mars.",
      "In an update about a week later, NASA said no transmissions had been received from MAVEN since Dec. 4, but that engineers had recovered a brief fragment of tracking data from Dec. 6.",
      "What they found was troubling: \u201cAnalysis of that signal suggests that the MAVEN spacecraft was rotating in an unexpected manner when it emerged from behind Mars,\u201d NASA officials said in a statement.",
      "The space agency has been using a global array of giant radio antennas, known as the Deep Space Network, to send commands to MAVEN and monitor for any incoming signals. On Dec. 16 and 20, NASA tried snapping photos of MAVEN in orbit from the surface of Mars, using an instrument aboard the agency\u2019s Curiosity rover.",
      "At the same time, mission controllers are closely analyzing the last fragments of tracking data recovered. NASA said on Dec. 23 that it was attempting to piece together a timeline of events to figure out what went wrong. NASA did not provide additional details in a request for comment and referred NBC News to the agency\u2019s update on Dec. 23.",
      "The MAVEN mission was originally designed to last just two years, but it has been operating continuously for more than a decade. In 2024, NASA celebrated the probe\u2019s 10th anniversary orbiting Mars.",
      "By studying the process of atmospheric loss on Mars, MAVEN was helping scientists get a clearer picture of the planet\u2019s past and present climate and how it transformed from a potentially habitable world with liquid water on its surface to the cold and barren planet that it is today.",
      "The spacecraft is one of three that NASA currently has in orbit around Mars. The space agency also operates the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched in 2005, and Mars Odyssey, which lifted off in 2001."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/alaskas-court-system-built-ai-chatbot-didnt-go-smoothly-rcna235985",
    "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Alaska\u2019s courts spent more than a year building an AI chatbot to help with probate, revealing how difficult it is to deploy AI in government services.",
    "story": [
      "Dealing with a loved one\u2019s belongings after their death is never easy. But as Alaska\u2019s state courts have discovered, an inaccurate or misleading artificial intelligence chatbot can easily make matters worse.",
      "For more than a year, Alaska\u2019s court system has been designing a pioneering generative AI chatbot termed the Alaska Virtual Assistant (AVA) to help residents navigate the tangled web of forms and procedures involved in probate, the judicial process of transferring property away from a deceased person.",
      "Yet what was meant to be a quick, AI-powered leap forward in increasing access to justice has spiraled into a protracted, yearlong journey plagued by false starts and false answers.",
      "AVA \u201cwas supposed to be a three-month project,\u201d said Aubrie Souza, a consultant with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) who has worked on and witnessed AVA\u2019s evolution. \u201cWe are now at well over a year and three months, but that\u2019s all because of the due diligence that was required to get it right.\u201d",
      "Designing this bespoke AI solution has illuminated the difficulties government agencies across the United States are facing in applying powerful AI systems to real-world problems where truth and reliability are paramount.",
      "\u201cWith a project like this, we need to be 100% accurate, and that\u2019s really difficult with this technology,\u201d said Stacey Marz, the administrative director of the Alaska Court System and one of the AVA project\u2019s leaders.",
      "\u201cI joke with my staff on other technology projects that we can\u2019t expect these systems to be perfect, otherwise we\u2019d never be able to roll them out. Once we get the minimum viable product, let\u2019s get that out there, and then we\u2019ll enhance that as we learn.\u201d",
      "But Marz said she thinks this chatbot should be held to a higher standard. \u201cIf people are going to take the information they get from their prompt and they\u2019re going to act on it and it\u2019s not accurate or not complete, they really could suffer harm. It could be incredibly damaging to that person, family or estate.\u201d",
      "While many local government agencies are experimenting with AI tools for use cases ranging from helping residents apply for a driver\u2019s license to speeding up municipal employees\u2019 ability to process housing benefits, a recent Deloitte report found that less than 6% of local government practitioners were prioritizing AI as a tool to deliver services.",
      "The AVA experience demonstrates the barriers government agencies face in attempting to leverage AI for increased efficiency or better service, including concerns about reliability and trustworthiness in high-stakes contexts, along with questions about the role of human oversight given fast-changing AI systems. These limitations clash with today\u2019s rampant AI hype and could help explain larger discrepancies between booming AI investment and limited AI adoption.",
      "Marz envisioned the AVA project as a cutting-edge, low-cost version of Alaska\u2019s family law helpline, which is staffed by court employees and provides free guidance about legal matters ranging from divorce to domestic violence protective orders.",
      "\u201cOur goal was to basically try to replicate the services with the chatbot that we would provide with a human facilitator,\u201d Marz told NBC News, referring to AVA\u2019s team of attorneys, technical experts and advisers from the NCSC. \u201cWe wanted a similar self-help experience, if somebody was able to talk to you and say, \u2018This is what I need help with, this is my situation.\u2019\u201d",
      "While the NCSC provided an initial grant to get AVA off the ground as part of its growing work on AI, the chatbot has been technically developed by Tom Martin, a lawyer and law professor who launched a law-focused AI company called LawDroid and designs legal AI tools.",
      "Describing the AVA service, Martin highlighted many critical decisions and considerations that go into the design process, such as choosing and shaping an AI system\u2019s personality.",
      "Many commentators and researchers have illustrated how certain models or versions of AI systems behave in different ways, almost as if they adopt different personas. Researchers and even users can alter these personas through technical tweaks, as many ChatGPT users found out earlier this year when the OpenAI service fluctuated between personalities that were either gushing and sycophantic or emotionally distant. Other models, like xAI\u2019s Grok, are known for having looser guardrails and increased willingness to embrace controversial topics.",
      "\u201cDifferent models have almost different types of personalities,\u201d Martin told NBC News. \u201cSome of them are very good at rule-following, while others are not as good at following rules and kind of want to prove that they\u2019re the smartest guy in the room.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor a legal application, you don\u2019t want that,\u201d Martin said. \u201cYou want it to be rule-following but smart and able to explain itself in plain language.\u201d",
      "Even traits that would otherwise be welcomed become more problematic when applied to topics as consequential as probate. Working with Martin, NCSC\u2019s Souza noted that early versions of AVA were too empathetic and annoyed users who might have been actively grieving and simply wanted answers about the probate process: \u201cThrough our user testing, everyone said, \u2018I\u2019m tired of everybody in my life telling me that they\u2019re sorry for my loss.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cSo we basically removed those kinds of condolences, because from an AI chatbot, you don\u2019t need one more,\u201d Souza said.",
      "Beyond the system\u2019s superficial tone and pleasantries, Martin and Souza had to contend with the serious issue of hallucinations, or instances in which AI systems confidently share false or exaggerated information.",
      "\u201cWe had trouble with hallucinations, regardless of the model, where the chatbot was not supposed to actually use anything outside of its knowledge base,\u201d Souza told NBC News. \u201cFor example, when we asked it, \u2018Where do I get legal help?\u2019 it would tell you, \u2018There\u2019s a law school in Alaska, and so look at the alumni network.\u2019 But there is no law school in Alaska.\u201d",
      "Martin has worked extensively to ensure the chatbot only references the relevant areas of the Alaska Court System\u2019s probate documents rather than conducting wider web searches.",
      "Across the AI industry, AI hallucinations have decreased over time and present less of a threat today than they did even several months ago. Many companies building AI applications like AI-agent provider Manus, which was recently acquired by Meta for more than $2 billion, stress the reliability of their services and include several layers of AI-powered verification to ensure their results are accurate.",
      "To evaluate the accuracy and helpfulness of AVA\u2019s responses, the AVA team designed a set of 91 questions regarding probate topics, asking the chatbot, for example, which probate form would be appropriate to submit if a user wanted to transfer the title of their deceased relative\u2019s car to their name.",
      "Yet the 91-question test proved too time-consuming to run and evaluate, according to Jeannie Sato, the Alaska Court System\u2019s director of access to justice services, given the stakes at hand and the need for human review.",
      "So Sato said the team landed on a refined list of just 16 test questions, featuring \u201csome questions that AVA had answered incorrectly, some that were complicated, and some that were pretty basic questions that we think AVA may be asked frequently.\u201d",
      "Cost is another critical issue for Sato and the AVA team. New iterations and versions of AI systems have caused usage fees to fall precipitously, which the AVA team sees as a key advantage of AI tools given limited court budgets.",
      "Martin told NBC News that under one technical setup, 20 AVA queries would cost only about 11 cents. \u201cI\u2019m mission-driven, and it\u2019s about impact for me in helping people in the world,\u201d Martin said. \u201cTo be able to carry forward with that mission, of course, cost is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Yet the ever-changing and advancing systems that power AVA\u2019s answers, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT family of models, mean that the administrative team will likely have to continuously and regularly monitor AVA for any behavioral or accuracy changes.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate needing to do regular checks and potentially update prompts or the models as new ones come out and others are retired. It\u2019s definitely something we\u2019ll need to stay on top of rather than a purely hands-off situation,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Despite its many fits and starts, AVA is now scheduled to be launched in late January, if all goes according to plan. For her part, Marz remains optimistic about AVA\u2019s potential to help Alaskans access the probate system but is more clear-eyed about AI\u2019s current limits.",
      "\u201cWe did shift our goals on this project a little bit,\u201d Marz said. \u201cWe wanted to replicate what our human facilitators at the self-help center are able to share with people. But we\u2019re not confident that the bots can work in that fashion, because of the issues with some inaccuracies and some incompleteness. But maybe with increasing model updates, that will change, and the accuracy levels will go up and the completeness will go up.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was just so very labor-intensive to do this,\u201d Marz added, despite \u201call the buzz about generative AI, and everybody saying this is going to revolutionize self-help and democratize access to the courts. It\u2019s quite a big challenge to actually pull that off."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump and the Supreme Court\u2019s smooth relationship could turn sour in the new year.",
      "The court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority mostly avoided direct confrontations with Trump in 2025 while handing him a series of wins, but it pushed rulings on a series of contentious White House proposals into this year. And there are signs the court could hand the president at least one major defeat.",
      "Heading into 2026, the court is set to rule on Trump\u2019s plan to curtail automatic birthright citizenship, his sweeping tariffs and his attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s powerful board of governors.",
      "In all three cases, the justices could have acted sooner, but the Supreme Court has a long history of waiting until a president has lost some of his post-election power and popularity before delivering major legal losses.",
      "\u201cThe court is not confronting the president head-on until spring this year,\u201d said Richard Pildes, a professor at New York University School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s very different in terms of his political strength.\u201d",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Trump started his second term with positive ratings in public polling, but surveys have shown views on the president\u2019s job performance sliding throughout 2025. The December NBC News Decision Desk Poll showed 42% of adults approving of Trump\u2019s performance, a slight decrease from April, while 58% disapprove.",
      "Last year, the court repeatedly granted emergency requests filed by the Trump administration that allowed it to move forward with policies that had been blocked by lower courts, drawing criticism even from some judges.",
      "Trump himself has heavily criticized lower court judges who have ruled against his policies, but has largely held fire when it comes to the Supreme Court, even on the rare occasions when he has lost, including a decision last month preventing him from deploying the National Guard in Chicago.",
      "But now the court is about to issue definitive rulings, not provisional decisions that merely decide whether government actions can be implemented while litigation continues.",
      "Tension between the president and the court is nothing new, but justices have often hesitated to rule against the White House early in a term, when voters have just given a president a new mandate. There are multiple examples of significant rulings against presidents when they are later in their terms and waning in popularity.",
      "Toward the end of President Harry Truman\u2019s presidency in 1952, the court had little hesitation in ruling that his attempt to seize control of steel mills during a labor dispute was unconstitutional.",
      "And in 1974, the Supreme Court helped put a final nail in the coffin of President Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency when it ruled against him over his attempt to withhold tapes of conversations in the White House during the Watergate scandal. Nixon resigned days later.",
      "More recently, the court handed major defeats to the administrations of President George W. Bush over its detention of suspected terrorists and President Barack Obama on a policy aimed at giving legal status to people who entered the country illegally, both in their final years in office. The court, with its current 6-3 conservative majority, frequently ruled against President Joe Biden on his use of executive power, including its decision killing his effort to forgive student loan debt, a major legacy item.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not making the argument that if they see the president as very popular, they won\u2019t rule against him or his policies, but you could say sometimes maybe the opposite is true,\u201d said Barbara Perry, an expert on presidential history at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center.",
      "\u201cIt would always be easier perhaps for them as human beings, but also in thinking about the legitimacy of the court, that they are on thicker ice if they are ruling against a president if they know he\u2019s unpopular,\u201d she added.",
      "An age-old concern for the court is that it lacks the ability to enforce its rulings, relying upon its legitimacy among the public and the goodwill of government officials. And lower court judges have on multiple occasions accused the Trump administration of not complying with court orders.",
      "As Jack Goldsmith, an expert in presidential power at Harvard Law School, wrote in a law review article in November, \u201cthe Court has acted, as it generally has through its history, to maximize its authority in the face of the reality that it lacks sword or purse.\u201d",
      "One notable feature in the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency is how the court has pushed potential conflict with the White House down the road. The administration has also been careful only to appeal cases to the court that it thinks it has a strong chance of winning.",
      "In the spring, for example, the administration asked the justices to block lower court rulings that said Trump\u2019s plan to end automatic birthright citizenship was unconstitutional. The government asked the justices to take up a technical question on whether judges had the power to block the policy nationwide and did not seek a definitive ruling on whether the policy was lawful.",
      "The court obliged, issuing a ruling in June that allowed the administration to take a major victory lap. Some court watchers wondered at the time why the court, as it had the authority to do, did not simply rule that the policy violates the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment, as every judge so far has ruled.",
      "Instead, the court waited until December to take up a case on the merits of the plan, with a ruling due by the end of June.",
      "The delay is significant, with most legal experts expecting the court to rule against Trump, the decision will come just months before the midterm elections that will put the president into lame duck territory.",
      "Similarly, the court in June last year turned away a request from companies challenging Trump\u2019s tariffs that it immediately rule on the policy and instead heard arguments in November, with a ruling to come early this year. During oral argument, justices appeared skeptical of Trump\u2019s power to impose the tariffs.",
      "And when it came to Trump\u2019s attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve, the court left in place lower court rulings that blocked the firing while agreeing to hear oral arguments on Jan. 21, 2026. In doing so, it took no action on Trump\u2019s request that he immediately be able to remove Cook from office.",
      "The delay does not mean the court will necessarily rule against the administration in all three cases, but Daniel Epps, a professor at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, suggested it might be more likely to do so given a less urgent timetable.",
      "\u201cKicking the can down the road, I think, is helpful to the court and probably helpful to people that are hopeful that the court rules against Trump,\u201d he said."

      "The Duffer brothers aren't ruling out whether she's alive, but confirm she's not coming back to the kids of Hawkins. That's the power of Mike's story, which allows her to remain a presence in their lives.",
      "\"If Eleven is out there, the most that they could hope for is a belief that it\u2019s true because they can\u2019t be in contact with her. Everything falls apart if that were the case. So if that\u2019s the narrative, this is really the best way to keep her alive. And it\u2019s about Mike and everyone finding a way to move past what\u2019s happened,\" Matt Duffer said."

      "In \"Marty Supreme,\" Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a fictionalized version of Marty Reisman, a real life table tennis star whose heyday was the 1940s and '50s.",
      "\"Marty Supreme\" co-writer and director Josh Safdie told the Hollywood Reporter the movie is an \"homage\" to table tennis pro Reisman rather than a biography.",
      "In the movie, Chalamet's character is a New York City shoe salesman in the 1950s whose flashy skills with a ping-pong paddle \u2014 and his sheer bravado \u2014 take the small and gritty table tennis world by storm.",
      "Chalamet's Marty has a nose for trouble and will do just about anything, legal or otherwise, to scrape up the dough needed to travel to the sport's open in Tokyo.",
      "The real-life Marty Reisman, whose slim physique earned him the nickname \"The Needle,\" was known for his swaggering style and for bringing a bit of razzle-dazzle to an often, at least at the time, overlooked sport.",
      "Like the Hollywood version of him, the sharp-dressed Reisman's one and only goal was to be known as the best table tennis player in the world, a pursuit he once called \"noble.\"",
      "Read on to learn more about Marty Reisman, the real-life man who inspired \"Marty Supreme.\"",
      "Marty Reisman Was a Superstar Table Tennis Player",
      "Reisman was born in February 1930 in New York City, according to his 1974 memoir, \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America's Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "\"I was a cocky gregarious kid, a bit of a showman and a showoff even then,\" he wrote in his memoir \u2014 qualities he'd have the rest of his life.",
      "His bold personality and undeniably athletic skills helped him to become a legend in the table tennis world. In his biography, he talks about his love for gambling and betting \u2014 on himself.",
      "He won his first championship in 1946, becoming the United States Junior National Champion, a feat he repeated the next year.  He went on to win multiple others, including a United States Doubles Championship in 1949 and a Singles Championship in 1958.",
      "In 1997, when he was 67, he became the oldest person to win a national championship in a racket sport, per his obituary.",
      "He Started Playing the Game As a Child to Deal with Anxiety",
      "Reisman told several interviewers he began playing ping-pong as a child to deal with his debilitating anxiety.",
      "\u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 9 years old and ended up in Bellevue Hospital. Ping-Pong was the ultimate escape. My racket became a sensuous connection between the ball and my brain,\" he told Forbes for an interview published in 2005.",
      "By 13, Reisman had become a city junior champion, often hustling other players for money at Lawrence\u2019s Broadway Table Tennis Club in New York City, reported Forbes. When he was 16, he did a tour of England with a three-man exhibition team, wowing audiences with their paddle skills.",
      "As \"Marty Supreme\" depicts, Reisman worked briefly as a shoe salesman, his only foray into the 9-5 world. For the rest of his life, he relied on his ping-pong skills to make money, he told Forbes.",
      "\"No one has ever been less suited for regular employment than I was,\" he quipped.",
      "He Was Famous for Performing Flashy Tricks",
      "After Reisman learned audiences would pay to see him do tricks while playing ping-pong, he began appearing in special exhibitions.",
      "He and U.S. teammate Doug Cartland accepted an offer to be the opening act for three years for the basketball trickster the Harlem Globetrotters, delighting audiences by playing \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d using frying pans, according to his biography.",
      "Reisman's signature trick, which he showed off during a visit to \"The Late Night Show with David Letterman\" in 2008, was snapping a cigarette in half with a slam.",
      "\"No other player was willing to try it before a large audience. It can be embarrassing to miss four or five times in a row. It is impossible to explain the shot. It involves a communion between the racket, the ball, and the cigarette, and takes a great deal of confidence,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "He Was Obsessed with Being the Best at His Sport",
      "Reisman's goal was to be the best ping-pong player in the world. He talked about his passion for the sport in in his 1974 memoir \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America\u2019s Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "His earnings were enough to make him a three-time millionaire, fortunes he repeatedly lost, according to The New York Times.",
      "\u201cI took on people in the gladiatorial spirit,\u201d he told the Times in March 2012, just months before his death.",
      "He Was As Impish As Chalamet's Character",
      "Like Chalamet's character in Marty Supreme,\" Reisman was also a the bad boy of his sport.",
      "In 1949, Reisman traveled to the English Open where he and fellow American player Dick Miles traded their modest London hotel for swankier accommodations. The pair ran up a tab on room service and other luxuries, charging it all to the English Table Tennis Association, according to his memoir.",
      "When the English officials balked, refusing to pay the bill, Reisman and Miles said they wouldn't participate in their sold-out exhibition matches.",
      "The English officials ended up covering the costs but fined the men $200 and suspended them from sanctioned table tennis worldwide. Reisman wrote the sanction was lifted in 1950.",
      "Reisman Died in 2012",
      "Reisman died in December 2012 of complications of heart and lung ailments age 82, according to The New York Times.",
      "His death was announced by Table Tennis Nation, an organization Reisman founded in 2010.",

      "Isaac Fitzgerald's picks",
      "\"The Rest of Our Lives\" by Ben Markovits",

Benjamin Markovits\u2019s magnetic prose feels both effortless and precise, as we follow Tom Layward who \u2014 after dropping his daughter off at college \u2014 just keeps driving. Here is a book that will find its home amongst the other great American road trip novels. An absolute triumph.\"",
      "\"On Morrison\" by Namwali Serpell",
      "Isaac says: \"'On Morrison' is a dazzling work of criticism.

Madeline Cash explores adolescence, faith, family, and power through the lens of a tightly controlled religious community, where devotion and vulnerability exist side by side. With wildly inventive writing, Lost Lambs captures moral uncertainty and emotional awakening with remarkable precision. This novel marks the emergence of an incredible new talent in Madeline Cash.\"",

Alongside beautiful illustrations by Lauren O\u2019Hara, Laufey\u2019s tender story offers a comforting message about growth, empathy, and finding joy in small moments.

Paula is one of our great American novelists, and 'Skylark' might be her best yet.\"",
      "\"Work in Progress\" by James Martin, SJ",
      "Adriana says: \"In Father James Martin\u2019s forthcoming memoir, 'Work in Progress,' we really get to know the beloved priest and his journey to becoming a leader in the Catholic Church. This is a coming-of-age story perfect for all readers of all faiths: relatable, readable, and full of wisdom.\"",
      "\"Keeper of Lost Children\" by Sadeqa Johnson",
      "Adriana says: \"Sadeqa Johnson is the master of historical fiction and 'Keeper of the Lost Children' does not disappoint. Set in post-WWII Germany, this novel visits an orphanage filled with the abandoned mixed-race children of German women and Black American GI\u2019s. This is an unknown history about love, resilience and identity.\"",
      "\"One Whole Hippopotamus\" by Carter Higgins",

      "\"I don\u2019t like thinking in terms of endgame because Darren (Star, the show's creator) keeps writing these amazing storylines that you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my God, I didn\u2019t see that coming,\u2019\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Ashley Park, who plays Mindy, agrees with her real-life bestie and notes that she was shocked when she learned that her character would have a secret romance with Alfie (Lucien Laviscount), Emily's ex, in Season 5.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t even think that Alfie was on the slate. I think if I chose one of them, then it would maybe limit the possibility of another season,\" she says.",
      "Season 5 ends with Nicolas (Paul Forman) proposing to Mindy and Emily breaking up with Marcello (Eugenio Franceschini). Then, Gabriel invites Emily to join him in Greece. Will she accept his offer? Fans will have to wait to see if the series gets renewed for Season 6 to find out.",
      "Regardless, Collins says she's more excited to see her character blossom personally and says the romance is just a bonus.",
      "\"I really love this idea that Emily just continues the relationship with herself and keeps evolving. And to me, that\u2019s the most beautiful relationship,\" she says.",
      "And besides, Emily and Mindy's friendship may be the most special relationship of all.",

      "Looking back on Emily and Mindy's romantic journeys in Season 5, Collins and Park have some thoughts about the direction they took in their personal lives.",
      "Park says it was interesting to see Mindy feeling romantically conflicted for the first time this season.",
      "\"I think for the first time, her gut and her heart and her mind are all in different places, and she doesn\u2019t know how to trust any one of them, and she ends up going with the flow in certain ways that are not true to herself,\" she says.",
      "Park says that Mindy \"leads with a lot of fear\" and \"self-preservation\" this season.",
      "\"And so, I would advise her to not do that,\" she says.",
      "Meanwhile, Collins is proud of the way that Emily gave Marcello a second chance, only to realize she couldn't move to Italy to be with him.",
      "\"I would tell Emily, 'Good job' because I think she stood up for herself in a lot of ways, and she made a decision that was really hard, but she followed her heart and she respected herself. She also allowed herself grace,\" Collins says."

      "The Artemis II mission, the next step in NASA\u2019s return-to-the-moon program, is expected to launch sometime from February to April. The flight will be a key test of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon to evaluate how the Orion spacecraft\u2019s various systems and hardware function in a deep space environment.",
      "The mission will be the first crewed flight of the Artemis program, and it will take the astronauts to the closest point humans have come to the moon in more than 50 years, since the end of the Apollo program.",
      "It will be closely watched, particularly as the Trump administration has repeatedly talked about the need to return to the moon before China lands its astronauts on the lunar surface. Much of that vision hinges on the outcome of the Artemis II mission.",
      "If it succeeds, the flight will pave the way for the Artemis III mission, which is expected to land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole. In a recent executive order, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 \u201cto assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire the next generation of American explorers.\u201d",

      "Despite bombs raining down and a lack of tools, feed and medicine, the shelter has remained operational throughout the two-year conflict, working to help emaciated and injured dogs, cats, donkeys and horses.",
      "At the shelter\u2019s site in Deir al-Balah, several dogs with three legs are among the animals running around, a stark reminder of the toll that the war has taken. In a large tent, veterinarians and volunteers work together to place an IV into the leg of a small, whimpering puppy.",

During the worst aid shortages, the team shared scarce rice, pasta and canned tuna with the animals, a desperate measure to prevent starvation.",
      "Since the war erupted in October 2023, Gaza\u2019s animal population has plummeted. According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, an estimated 97% of the strip\u2019s livestock has been destroyed through bombing, starvation and looting. This includes cows, sheep, goats and poultry.",
      "Large animals like donkeys and horses have dropped to around 30% of their former numbers.",
      "Stray pets have not been spared; countless dogs and cats were abandoned as families fled, leading to a surge in malnutrition, diseases like parvovirus, anemia and respiratory infections. Veterinary reports describe animals in states of \u201ccachexia\u201d \u2014 severe wasting \u2014 with weakened immune systems exacerbating outbreaks of gastroenteritis, jaundice and eye diseases. Sulala\u2019s clinic treats these conditions daily.",
      "\u201cPeople seek comfort in animals. Some find support in dogs, while others find it in cats. During the war, I witnessed many individuals caring for and sheltering animals, both cats and dogs. They reached out to us, and we consistently provided them with food,\u201d Al-Aar told NBC News.",
      "The Sulala Animal Rescue team worked in dire and dangerous conditions as Israel continued its assault on Gaza. Famine conditions in Gaza City have eased since the ceasefire began in October, according to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises, but the situation remains critical, with the entire strip still at risk of starvation.",
      "Veterinarian Muath Talat Abo Rokba, who worked with Sulala and also ran his own veterinary clinic, was reportedly killed by Israeli forces in October, while the ceasefire was in effect. He had been visiting the ruins of his home in the Jabalia area, close to the \u201cyellow line\u201d marking Israeli-held territory, Sulala Animal Rescue said at the time. The IDF told NBC News that it was not aware of the specific incident.",
      "\u201cThere are no words we have about losing him,\u201d said Annelies Keuleers, a remote volunteer and spokesperson for Sulala Animal Rescue. \u201cIn many ways, he was absolutely irreplaceable.\u201d",
      "The shelter\u2019s Instagram page has attracted a dedicated following amid the conflict, with 180,000 followers, many of whom are located in the West, eagerly watching for updates on Al-Aar, his team and the animals the organization helps.",
      "Keuleers, who volunteers from Belgium, told NBC News that she worries constantly for the safety of the rescue team on the ground.",
      "\u201cSaeed and his children have been in dangerous situations to try and pick up animals that have been left behind during evacuations, that have been starving there.\u201d",
      "She continued: \u201cThere\u2019s been a couple of times where I hadn\u2019t heard from anyone for a day or a day and a half. And that\u2019s been scary, as I wasn\u2019t sure how I would know if they were bombed or killed.\u201d",
      "Even with a fragile ceasefire in place, human suffering in Gaza remains acute, compounding the animal plight.",
      "While the ceasefire has improved the flow of some deliveries into Gaza, the World Health Organization warned earlier this month that \u201chumanitarian needs remain staggering, with current assistance addressing only the most basic survival requirements.\u201d",

      "Despite the dangers that persist for Al-Aar and the other veterinarians and volunteers, they remain devoted to helping animals, even at a time when so much human suffering persists.",

      "A photo shows partygoers hoisting wine bottles fitted with sparklers, yet even as they toast the occasion flames are already visible on the foam soundproofing lining the low ceiling of the bar at the upscale Alpine ski resort.",
      "The fire, which broke out around 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland and left 40 dead, appears to have started when sparklers atop bottles were brought too close to the ceiling, Beatrice Pilloud, the Valais canton Attorney General, told a news conference Friday after preliminary investigations.",
      "The sparklers appear to have led to \u201cwhat is referred to as a flashover incident where the fire spread very rapidly,\u201d she said. Investigators would assess soundproofing foam used in the ceiling, and whether anyone needs to be held criminally liable for the fire, she added.",
      "On Friday, officials set about the painful task of identifying the dozens of charred bodies left by the fire, while emerging images and eyewitnesses gave an indication of the horrific scene that unfolded.",
      "One video \u2014 like that photo, geolocated by NBC News to inside the venue in the early hours of New Year's Day \u2014 suggests that the panic was not immediate. Even as flames licked the rafters and debris began to drip down, some onlookers filmed on their phones while others kept dancing or talking over the music. Another person attempted to beat the flames with a white T-shirt.",

The nationality is unknown for 14 of those injured.",
      "On Thursday evening, mourners had arranged hundreds of candles at a traffic circle near the venue, which had by this point been covered up in white plastic by authorities. There was an air of somber stillness, with the mostly young crowd sharing hugs, and expressions of shock and disbelief.",

      "He told NBC News that many of them had \"serious injuries\" that appeared to have been caused by the twin phenomena of \"backdraft\" and \"flashover.\"",
      "Backdraft is when new air comes into contact with a fire that has used up all the available oxygen. This can lead \"to immediate fatal injuries, including severe blast trauma, extensive thermal damage, and lethal inhalation of toxic gases,\" Larribau said, \"and is therefore more commonly observed among nonsurvivors rather than among rescued victims.\"",
      "Flashover occurs when all flammable materials in an enclosed space ignite simultaneously, causing \"severe, often deep, burns predominantly affecting exposed body areas such as the face, neck, and upper limbs, and is frequently associated with critical inhalation injury due to intense radiant heat and superheated gases,\" he said.",
      "\"For those who survive, there will be weeks or even months of rehabilitation, and many will suffer lifelong consequences,\" he added.",
      "Authorities said they had ruled out terrorism, saying that an explosion at the venue was caused by the fire, rather than the other way round.",
      "They have not commented on the images of bottles fitted with sparklers. Those novelty drinks have appeared in past promotional videos for the bar, served by waiting staff wearing helmets rimmed with neon lights.",
      "Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press news agency that he saw these drinks being handed out.",
      "The French and Italian governments have said their citizens are among those missing.",

      "\u201cI would give anything in the world if, in this address, I could say that peace will also come in just a few minutes,\u201d Zelenskyy said just before the clock struck midnight. \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot say that yet. But with a clear conscience, I \u2014 all of us \u2014 can say that Ukraine is truly doing everything for peace.\u201d",

Afterward, Zelenskyy said Trump had offered 15 years of the crucial \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d that he says are essential to stop Putin from attacking again. Ukraine had asked for 50 years, he said.",

Ten percent to peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader charted what has been a roller-coaster year trying to retain the goodwill of Trump, a pivotal and changeable figure in the peace process.

      "The arid coastal strip in the northwest of Venezuela, known as Alta Guajira, is heavily controlled by the National Liberation Army, or Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (ELN) in Spanish, an armed guerilla group known for its history of drug trafficking that is also active in neighboring Colombia.",

      "NBC News reporting has not established a link between the explosion described by Trump and the explosion described by the eyewitnesses in northwest Venezuela.",
      "The apparent attack follows months of U.S. military pressure, including dozens of strikes on boats in international waters. The White House has claimed that the boats carried drugs, though officials have not provided evidence.",

      "Pressed about the attack Monday at a media availability session at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, Trump said it was a \u201cmajor explosion\u201d in a dock area along Venezuela\u2019s shoreline where boats were loaded with drugs.",
      "The CIA has declined to comment on reports that it conducted a drone strike last week at a port facility in Venezuela. The White House has also declined to comment beyond Trump\u2019s remarks on anything related to possible land strikes in Venezuela.",

She said she was fishing for dinner along with relatives when the explosion destroyed the hut.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Ana said, noting that the explosion was so loud that she and her relatives were unable to hear for hours.

      "According to Ana, representatives from the Venezuelan government showed up the morning after she heard the blast \u2014 around 10 a.m. Dec. 19. She said local residents asked them for help, for a doctor to check on the hearing problems and for new fishing nets and hammocks, which had also been blown up.",
      "Ana said one of government representatives blamed the U.S. and said: \u201cThe gringos did this.\u201d",
      "NBC News asked the Venezuelan government for comment and did not immediately receive a response. It is not clear who was responsible for the Dec. 18 explosion.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to be alive,\u201d Ana said. \u201cBut we\u2019re scared.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cI know exactly who it was, but I don\u2019t want to say who it was. But you know, it was along the shore.\u201d",
      "With details so scarce, Trump\u2019s comments have touched off a wave of speculation inside Venezuela about the U.S.\u2019 target. For days, local news reports and videos on social media have circulated of a explosion last Wednesday in Maracaibo, a major port city.",
