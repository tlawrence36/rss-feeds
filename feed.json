      "Otto Schenk, an actor who became a noted director praised for traditional opera productions and criticized by advocates of contemporary approaches, died Thursday",
      "Otto Schenk, an actor who became a noted director praised for traditional opera productions and criticized by advocates of contemporary approaches, died Thursday at age 94.",
      "Schenk lived in Austria, and his death was announced by the Vienna State Opera.",
      "He created 31 productions there, starting with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cJen\u016ffa\u201d in 1964 and ending with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cThe Cunning Little Vixen\u201d in 2014. Many of his creations remain in use, including a 1979 version of Johann Strauss II's \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d that was streamed around the world on New Year's Eve.",
      "\u201cOtto Schenk is an essential, unforgettable chapter in the history of our theater,\u201d Vienna State Opera Director Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 said in a statement. \u201cBut he was also an artist who shaped the world of theater for half a century like few others. As sacred as the theater was to him, he approached the works naturally and fearlessly, drawing on an immense knowledge. An infinite love for the singers went hand in hand with hard, uncompromising rehearsal work and honesty. \u201d",
      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",
      "Born in Vienna, Schenk studied acting at Vienna's University of Music and Performing Arts, began directing in 1953 and led his first opera, Mozart's \u201cDie Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute),\" at Salzburg's State Theatre in 1957. He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",
      "\u201cThe theater world has lost one of its greatest phenomena, an exceptional artist, a real legend,\u201d current Salzburg Festival artistic director Markus Hinterh\u00e4user said in a statement.",
      "At the Met, his stagings of Offenbach's \u201cLes Contes d\u2019Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann)\u201d and Wagner's \u201cTannh\u00e4user\u201d in 1977 earned rave reviews, and Met artistic director James Levine picked him to direct a new Ring Cycle plus Wagner's \u201cParsifal\u201d in 1991 and \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\" in 1993.",
      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",
      "\u201cWagner in his life gave no indication on what the Ring meant,\" Schenk told the AP. \"He didn\u2019t interpret.\u201d"

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX. Amazing. Chappell Roan (is) incredible. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s maybe not quite premier tier as well. And I think there's been maybe a little bit of a reaction to that.",
      "I think from our perspective, just, yeah, make the thing that you love and then you\u2019re not really going to go wrong."

      "The upcoming season will focus on lessons in emotional well-being. It debuts Jan. 16 on MAX with new episodes releasing every Thursday. \u201cSesame Street\u201d will also be available on PBS stations and to stream on PBS Kids in the fall.",
      "No one is more excited than Elmo himself.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot to learn from music \u2014 yeah, timing and harmonies and melody and different styles and different cultures,\u201d the 3 1/2-year-old monster told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's really cool! We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA! Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Samara Joy \u2014 lots of great people!\u201d",
      "Songs double as life lessons on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d from an alt-R&B-pop track about gratitude with SZA to an acoustic number about feelings with Rapp.",
      "\"SZA is really cool \u2014 really talented. And \u2018gratitude\u2019 was a new word for Elmo, too. So, Elmo learned all about gratitude with SZA,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Elmo was feeling really, really happy after his playdate with Miss Rene\u00e9. It was a really beautiful song. She's got a great voice and Elmo hopes she comes back soon.\u201d",
      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",
      "\u201cBut also, Elmo would love to sing with Miss Beyonc\u00e9. Destiny's Child was on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 so Elmo would love to have her back.\u201d"

      "The untelevised but starry NBR Awards were a chance for many of the nominees who didn\u2019t win Sunday to trot out their would-be acceptance speeches, including Daniel Craig, Kieran Culkin and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Accepting the award for best actress for her performance in the erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl,\u201d Kidman celebrated by chugging a glass of milk, a nod to some of the film's kinky sex games. After finishing, Kidman triumphantly announced \u201cGood girl!\" and left the stage.",
      "It also was an opportunity for some jabs at the Globes. \u201cIsn\u2019t this room just a little bit classier than the Beverly Hilton?\u201c quipped presenter Christine Baranski, looking around the elegant marble-columned midtown venue, Cipriani\u2019s.",
      "Others were less impressed by the old-school New York vibe. \u201cThe bathroom attendant, that shouldn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Culkin said during a typically free-form acceptance speech for best supporting actor for his role in \u201cA Real Pain.\u201d",
      "The night belonged to Jon M. Chu's \u201cWicked.\u201d The musical was the board's pick for best film, best director for Chu and a special award for the creative collaboration of Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. The two, in back-and-forth remarks, continued their mutual praise of each other.",

      "Chu, who was introduced by Lin Manuel-Miranda, used the moment to reflect on his yearslong journey with \u201cWicked,\u201d which will be followed by an already-shot part two due out this November. So lengthy has his time in Oz been that the director noted he had three children during its making, including one born the day of the movie's premiere.",

      "The common theme of the night was community and togetherness. Coming a day after the anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and less than two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, many alluded to Hollywood's role in the coming years.",
      "Marc Platt, producer of \u201cWicked,\u201d spoke about the deeper meanings of the film and having \u201cthe courage to speak truth to power especially when that power is manifested by those who come to it by blame or divisiveness.\u201d",

      "A key feature of the NBR Awards, which were founded in 1909 by film enthusiasts, is its style of award presentation. Each winner is introduced by a close friend, collaborator or admirer. Last year\u2019s surprise guest was Daniel Day-Lewis, who presented for Martin Scorsese and the best-film winner \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\"",
      "This year, Robert Pattinson dropped in to introduce India Donaldson, winner of the breakthrough director award for her acclaimed debut \u201cGood One.\u201d Pattinson called Donaldson \u201cone of the most exciting filmmakers working today.\u201d",
      "Sofia Coppola presented best supporting actress to Elle Fanning, who starred as a 12-year-old in 2010's \u201cSomewhere,\u201d for her performance in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s really the same person that I met when she was 11,\u201d Coppola said.",
      "Other introductions were more surprising. John Lithgow, there as part of the \u201cConclave\u201d group that won best ensemble, introduced breakthrough performance winner and \u201cAnora\u201d star Mikey Madison. Lithgow had only just met her but profusely praised her performance, listing a wide array of its traits, one of which drew giggles from the crowd, and the 25-year-old Madison.",

      "Carol Kane presented best animated film to the wondrous Latvian film \u201cFlow,\u201d about a cat and other animals in a flooded world. She didn\u2019t, at first, seem well-suited to the job.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t get animation. I like to watch people, you know,\u201d Kane said. Then she relented, calling \u201cFlow\u201d a revelation. \u201cAnimals, for a long time now, have been some of my favorite people.\u201d"

      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized",
      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?",
      "The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.",
      "This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.",
      "While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.",
      "Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d with six. Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

      "\u201cI was always drawn to left-of-center things,\u201d he told Jim Alexander two years ago in an interview for the Reel Talker YouTube channel.",

The 40-year-old actor and producer rose to fame playing April Ludgate on the television series \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and was nominated for an Emmy for her role on \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d The couple married in 2021.",
      "\u201cThe opportunities to create together, to do something creative where we're both fulfilled, it's like how rare is that? She's down and she's so talented, so I'm really lucky,\" Baena said.",
      "A representative for Plaza said that in addition to Plaza, Baena is survived by his mother, Barbara Stern, stepfather Roger Stern, father Scott Baena, stepmother Michele Baena, brother Brad Baena and stepsiblings Bianca Gabay and Jed Fluxman."

      "Viola Davis and Ted Danson have been celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence",
      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Viola Davis' journey to becoming one of Hollywood's most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra: Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new characters while honing her skills.",
      "Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial necessity often influenced her choice of roles.",
      "\u201cIf I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I wouldn\u2019t be standing up here,\u201d said Davis, who along with Ted Danson, recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the 82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday.",
      "Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds. It\u2019s the first time the Globes hosted a separate event dedicated to both awards.",
      "Davis said she couldn't afford to wait for the perfect role, especially as a \u201cdark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big lips.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I took it for the money,\u201d said Davis, who won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as \"Fences,\"\u201cThe Woman King,\u201d \u201cThe Help\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe that poverty is really the answer to craft,\u201d she said. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any nobility in poverty.\u201d",
      "Meryl Streep presented the award to Davis, who she called a pure artist who \u201cdelivers the truth every time.\u201d Both actors worked together in the 2008 film \u201cDoubt,\u201d where Streep first became in awe of Davis, who she called her \u201cfavorite actor in the world.\u201d",
      "The DeMille Award has been bestowed on Hollywood\u2019s greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.",
      "When Danson accepted his award, he congratulated Davis, calling her an \u201camazing actor.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's such a pleasure to be in the same room with you,\u201d said Danson, a three-time Globes winner, who has been a fixture on TV since he broke out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC\u2019s comedy \u201cCheers.\u201d His other credits include \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d \u201cMr. Mayor,\u201d \u201cFargo,\u201d \u201cCSI\u201d and \u201cCSI: Cyber,\u201d \u201cDamages\u201d and \u201cBecker.\u201d",
      "Danson currently stars in Netflix\u2019s \u201cA Man on the Inside,\u201d which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.",
      "\u201cBia Iftikhar, who does his hair on set, said it best: \u2018Ted sets the tone,\u2019\u201d said his wife, actor Mary Steenburgen, who presented Danson with the Carol Burnett Award, which was inaugurated in 2019. Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.",
      "Danson and Steenburgen appeared in a few projects together including \u201cPontiac Moon,\u201d \u201cGulliver's Travels\u201d and \u201cIt Must Be Love.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe's so loving and takes such joy in acting that all of us who are hard at work away from our families for long hours get to work on a set that is dictated by his kindness,\u201d Steenburgen said. \u201cAs his wife, watching the respect and love ... for Ted, it made me very proud.\u201d",
      "Danson traded \u201cI love you\u201d with Burnett, showing admiration for each other. He thanked a number of writers, producers and actors along with the \u201cCheers\u201d co-creators Glen and Les Charles, who surprised him by showing up to the event.",
      "\u201cI feel so grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm truly the luckiest... on Earth.\"",
      "Davis quipped, \u201cLittle Viola is squealing,\" referring to how her younger self would be overjoyed at the actor's journey from an impoverished childhood to Hollywood stardom.",
      "\u201cShe's standing behind me and she's pulling on my dress,\u201d said Davis, who achieved EGOT status after winning a Grammy last year for best audio book, narration, and storytelling for the recording for her memoir \u201cFinding Me.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe's wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine because they her feel \u2018purty'\" she continued. \"What she's whispering is: \u2018I told you I was a magician.\u2019\u201d",

He parked the souped-up golf cart and tossed the keys ZZ Top-style ahead of the first day of his new job.",
      "He then dropped a profanity into the start of his monologue.",
      "Roll out The Chug Machine, fly, F-bombs, fly and save a seat for Sir Charles because the latest host crashing late-night television is a bit more raw than the traditional suit-and-tie joke tellers.",

      "Here's Kelce!",
      "\u201cI used to love watching late-night TV growing up,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce quickly proved there\u2019s space for another JK in late night \u2014 Kelce disappeared into a portal where he walked out into (a pantsless) Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s office to ask for hosting advice \u2014 and moderated a loose panel of sports topics with guests Charles Barkley, rapper and actor Lil Dicky, and NFL Network analyst Brian Baldinger.",
      "And Kelce said he received real guidance from Kimmel on the art of hosting.",
      "\u201cHe sat me down and really explained some things that he thought would accelerate this process for me,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce bantered with the guests during commercial breaks and took questions from a few of about 300 fans in the audience. When a fan from New Jersey invited Kelce to his wedding, the retired star quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t go into New Jersey.\u201d",
      "Eagles fan and Penn State student Caleb Tinley learned only two days earlier he was randomly selected for a pair of free tickets and was first in line around noon to get a good seat for the taping. He\u2019s a fan of the \u201c New Heights \u201d podcast Kelce co-hosts with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and figured the TV show was as close to that experience as he could get.",
      "\u201cEver since he had that speech at the Super Bowl, he became a Philly legend,\u201d Tinley said.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who retired in March after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles \u2014 has watched his profile balloon in retirement. The Super Bowl winner already hosted the podcast but has become a prolific pitchman hawking everything from chicken wings to soup, to laundry detergent to cereal, to hoagies to his own beer company.",

The retired center taking center stage on a late-night staple such as a talk show \u2014 no Letterman, though he did wear his Cleveland Heights letterman's jacket \u2014 seemed a natural extension into his growing entertainment profile.",
      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television.

      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "Setting boundaries at work can be tricky",
      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",
      "Mobile devices make it easier to work from anywhere, and harder to draw boundaries. But there are ways to adjust our devices so they're less distracting.",
      "After noticing that she checked email far too frequently on weekends, Nasir starting moving the Gmail app from her iPhone\u2019s homepage to the second page from Friday night to Sunday night.",
      "An email signature is another tool you can use to manage expectations, by publishing working hours or upcoming vacation schedules, said Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at Segal Consulting.",
      "Pokk includes a \u201cWell Being Notice\u201d at the bottom of her emails which reads, \u201cReceiving this email outside normal working hours? Managing a work-life balance is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.\u201d",
      "With the popularity of online meeting software, it's easy for others to overload your calendar with invitations. Accepting every one can leave little time for other work.",
      "Janine Pelosi, CEO of Oslo-based video technology company Neat, thinks workers should be able to leave a meeting that's not relevant to them, if it's an environment where that's accepted.",
      "If you're unsure it's worthwhile to attend, you can request an agenda in advance, or ask what is the desired outcome, she said.",
      "Publisher Lori Perkins, 65, was working 12 to 16 hours daily when a cancer diagnosis halted her routine. During chemotherapy, she could only muster up enough energy to put in four hours a day, and even then felt like she was working \u201cin a vat of molasses.\u201d",
      "After treatment, \"I realized I was going to live, and then I said to myself, \u2018Do I want to continue doing this?\u2019\u201d Perkins said.",
      "She now caps her work as owner of Riverdale Avenue Books at about 50 hours per week, and as a result can't review as many manuscripts. Instead of sending rejection letters, she tells authors to come back in three to six months when it's less hectic.",
      "She practices saying \u201cno\u201d in her head and in her journal, where she also chronicles what happened after she said it. She's gained time to visit museums, friends and the theater.",
      "\u201cNo changed my life,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cI am a different person than I was before I really learned to embrace no.\"",

      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications during a recent five-year period",
      "As U.S. lawmakers debate issues around health care for transgender youth, it\u2019s been difficult to determine the number of young people receiving gender-affirming medications, leaving room for exaggerated and false claims.",
      "Now, a medical journal has published the most reliable estimate yet and the numbers are low, reflecting more clearly on medical practices now being weighed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications \u2014 puberty blockers or hormones \u2014 during a recent five-year period, according to the study released Monday.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A decision by the Supreme Court in a Tennessee case is expected later this year. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "\u201cWe are not seeing inappropriate use of this sort of care,\" said lead author Landon Hughes, a Harvard University public health researcher. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly not happening at the rate at which people often think it is.\u201d",
      "The researchers analyzed a large insurance claims database covering more than 5 million patients ages 8 to 17.",
      "Only 926 adolescents with a gender-related diagnosis received puberty blockers from 2018 through 2022. During that time, 1,927 received hormones. The findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, suggest that fewer than 0.1% of all youth in the database received these medications.",
      "The researchers found that no patients under age 12 were prescribed hormones, an indication that doctors are appropriately cautious about when to start such treatments, Hughes said.",
      "\u201cI hope that our paper cools heads on this issue and ensures that the public is getting a true sense of the number of people who are accessing this care,\u201d he said.",
      "The database included insurance plans in all 50 states, but did not include youth covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people.",
      "The study did not look at surgeries among transgender adolescents. Other researchers have found those procedures are extremely rare among young people.",
      "Not all transgender youth proceed with medical treatments, said Dr. Scott Leibowitz, co-lead author of the adolescent standards of care for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, a leading transgender health group.",
      "Transgender adolescents \u201ccome to understand their gender at different times and in different ways,\u201d he said, noting that the best care should include experts in adolescent identity development who can work with families to help figure out what\u2019s appropriate for each young person.",
      "Leibowitz, who has worked in gender clinics in several U.S. cities, said the study \u201cadds to the growing evidence base about best practices when serving transgender and gender diverse youth.\u201d",

      "Indonesia\u2019s new government has begun an ambitious project to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable.",
      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",
      "\u201cToo many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,\u201d Subianto said.",
      "Subianto\u2019s signature program could cost upward of 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) by the end of his term in 2029. He said his team has made the calculations to run such a program, and \u201cWe are capable.\u201d",
      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",

      "Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe",
      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe.",
      "These dangers can include carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and frozen pipes that can burst and make homes unlivable.",
      "Public safety officials and experts say there are multiple ways people can prepare themselves to avoid these winter weather hazards and keep themselves safe.",
      "The hazards are on the radar this week because millions of people in the United States are set to be hit with moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington. Cold conditions are also gripping the East Coast.",
      "Officials say that during a winter storm, people should stay indoors. But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.",
      "Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won\u2019t necessarily be aware of it.",
      "\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.",
      "The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",
      "The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far.",
      "\u201cReally cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.",
      "\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.",
      "The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet.",
      "\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.",
      "But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.",
      "Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.",
      "Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.",
      "Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal.",
      "Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don\u2019t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster.",
      "In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather.",

But in Oregon and elsewhere in the country, progressive lawmakers' attempts to expand abortion access sometimes clash with rural constituencies.",
      "",
      "Oregon is considered one of the most protective states in the country when it comes to abortion. There are no legal limits on when someone can receive an abortion in the state, and the service is covered by its Medicaid system. Still, efforts to expand access in the rural, largely conservative areas that cover most of the state have encountered resistance and incredulity.",
      "",
      "It's a divide that has played out in elections in such states as Nevada, where voters passed a ballot measure in November that seeks to codify abortion protections in the state constitution. Residents in several rural counties opposed the measure.",
      "",
      "In Oregon, during the months just before the Baker City closure was announced, Democratic state lawmakers were focused on a proposed pilot program that would launch two mobile reproductive healthcare clinics in rural areas. The bill specified that the van-based clinics would include abortion services.",
      "",
      "State Rep. Christine Goodwin, a Republican from a southwestern Oregon district, called the proposal the \"latest example\" of urban legislators telling rural leaders what their communities need.",
      "",
      "The mobile health clinic pilot was eventually removed from the bill that was under discussion. That means no new abortion options in Oregon's Baker County  --  and no new state-funded maternity care either.",
      "",
      "\"I think if you expanded rural access in this community to abortions before you extended access to maternal healthcare, you would have an uprising on your hands,\" said Paige Witham, 27, a member of the Baker County healthcare steering committee and the mother of two children, including an infant born in October.",
      "",
      "A study published in JAMA in early December that examined nearly 5,000 acute care hospitals found that by 2022, 52% of rural hospitals lacked obstetrics care after more than a decade of unit closures. The health implications of those closures for young women, the population most likely to need pregnancy care, and their babies can be significant. Research has shown that added distance between a patient and obstetric care increases the likelihood the baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.",
      "",
      "Witham said that while she does not support abortion, she believes the government should not \"legislate it away completely.\" She said that unless the government provides far more support for young families, like free child care and better mental healthcare, abortion should remain legal.",

      "",
      "Kelle Osborn, RN, a nurse supervisor for the Baker County Health Department, loved the idea of a mobile clinic that would provide education and birth control services to people in outlying areas. She was less thrilled about including abortion services in a clinic on wheels.",

More than two-thirds of people in \"maternity care deserts\"  --  all of which are in rural counties  --  must drive more than a half-hour to get obstetric care, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. For people in the Southern states where lawmakers installed abortion bans, abortion care can be up to 700 miles away, according to a data analysis by Axios.",

People most in need of abortion often don't have access to any medical service not already available in town, the doctor pointed out.

      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "A Panamanian national holiday remembering the killing of 21 protesters by police and U.S. troops in 1964 is taking on new resonance this year as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatens to take back control of the Panama Canal",
      "PANAMA CITY -- A Panamanian national holiday remembering the killing of 21 protesters by police and U.S. troops in 1964 is taking on new resonance this year as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatens to take back control of the Panama Canal.",
      "On Jan. 9, 1964, students protested in the then-U.S. controlled canal zone over not being allowed to fly Panama\u2019s flag at a secondary school there. The protests expanded to general opposition to the U.S. presence in Panama and U.S. troops got involved.",
      "Historians say what has come to be known as Martyrs\u2019 Day was a key point of inflection that led to the signing of an agreement more than a decade later by U.S. President Jimmy Carter to turn over control of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.",
      "This year the holiday coincided with Carter\u2019s funeral in Washington. The former president died Dec. 29 at the age of 100.",
      "But Trump is bringing an expansionist attitude to his second term and on Tuesday, refused to rule out the use of military force to seize control of the Panama Canal. Trump has complained in recent weeks about rising charges for ships to transit the canal and suggested the U.S. should take it back.",
      "It\u2019s a proposal roundly rejected by Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino.",
      "On Thursday, Esmeralda Orobio, the niece of one of those killed in 1964, said during a ceremony that \u201cThe Panama Canal is ours and we are going to defend it.\u201d",
      "Michael Shifter, former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washinton and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, called Trump\u2019s rhetoric an \u201cempty threat.\u201d",

      "Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is travelling to Syria on Friday to encourage the transition in the country following the ouster of President Bashar Assad by Islamist insurgents",
      "ROME -- Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is travelling to Syria on Friday to encourage the country's transition following the ouster of President Bashar Assad by Islamist insurgents, and said Europe should review its sanctions on Damascus now that the political situation has changed.",
      "Tajani presided Thursday over a meeting in Rome of foreign ministry officials from five countries \u2014 Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United States \u2014 and spoke earlier by telephone with his counterparts from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The aim, he said, is to coordinate the various post-Assad initiatives, with Italy prepared to make proposals on private investments in health care for the Syrian population.",
      "Going into the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their European counterparts, Tajani said it was critical that all Syrians be recognized with equal rights. It was a reference to concerns about the rights of Christians and other minorities under Syria\u2019s new de facto authorities of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamic militant group that the U.S. and U.N. have long designated as a terrorist organization.",
      "\u201cThe first messages from Damascus have been positive. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going there tomorrow, to encourage this new phase that will help stabilize the international situation,\u201d said Tajani.",
      "Speaking to reporters, he said the European Union should discuss possible changes to the sanctions regime on Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that should be discussed because Assad isn\u2019t there anymore, it\u2019s a new situation, and I think that the encouraging signals that are arriving should be further encouraged,\u201d he said.",
      "Syria has been under deeply isolating sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad\u2019s brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and spiraled into civil war.",
      "HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended his family\u2019s decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad\u2019s downfall, Syria\u2019s uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people.",
      "The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month.",
      "Syria\u2019s new leaders also have been urged to respect the rights of minorities and women. Many Syrian Christians, who made up 10% of the population before Syria\u2019s civil war, either fled the country or supported Assad out of fear of Islamist insurgents."

      "In what Mujica said would be his last interview, he told Busqueda, a weekly news magazine in Uruguay, that he was \u201cdoomed.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I am dying,\u201d said the former leader, who governed the small South American nation of Uruguay from 2010 to 2015. The article noted that he had tears in his eyes.",

      "Known among both fans and detractors as \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, the folksy ex-president of Uruguay first burst into politics as a leader of the Tupamaros, the Marxist militant group that drew inspiration from the Cuban revolution.",
      "Later, as Uruguay's 40th president, he transformed his nation into one of the healthiest and most socially liberal democracies in Latin America, legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and recreational marijuana. As a leftist icon, he sparked global fascination by shunning the presidential palace to live in a tiny farmhouse and donating most of his salary to charity.",
      "The 89-year-old first revealed last April that doctors had found a cancerous tumor in his esophagus. He underwent radiotherapy, and, last September, Mujica\u2019s doctors said the esophageal cancer appeared to have gone into remission.",
      "Although the radiation left him weak and almost unable to eat, Mujica reappeared on the political stage last fall, campaigning for his left-wing coalition, the Broad Front, in drama-free national elections that affirmed Uruguay as one of the region's strongest democracies.",
      "Mujica's preferred candidate and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, won the presidential vote last November and is set to take office March 1.",
      "In the interview with Busqueda, Mujica said his autoimmune disease, severe kidney disease and other underlying medical problems led to his decision not to pursue treatment after medical tests showed his cancer had returned and metastasized.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old man, and because I have two chronic illnesses my body cannot handle it,\" he said.",
      "Mujica's personal doctor, Raquel Pannone, held a news conference Thursday to elaborate on the ex-president's medical condition. She said treatment options for the cancer were limited from the start, given Mujica's various illnesses.",
      "\u201cHe should continue like this and be as calm as possible,\u201d Pannone said, declining to provide further details about Mujica\u2019s prognosis. She said the leftist leader had not experienced changes to his daily life or pain levels.",
      "Although Mujica ostensibly retired from politics when he left the Senate in 2020, he remained a powerful force in the Broad Front. He is considered among the most popular politicians in the country.",
      "Mujica told Busqueda that he would devote his \u201cfinal stage\u201d of life to his farm on the outskirts of Montevideo, the capital, where he has grown chrysanthemums with his wife for decades.",
      "\u201cWhat I want is to say goodbye to my fellow countrymen,\u201d he said in the interview.",
      "His supporters, including leftist readers from across Latin America, shared messages of encouragement on social media.",
      "Seemingly unable to help himself from dispensing the plain-spoken wisdom for which he is admired, Mujica repeatedly answered interview questions with philosophical aphorisms.",
      "\"Life is a beautiful adventure and a miracle,\" he said. \u201cWe are too focused on wealth and not on happiness. We are focused only on doing things and, before you know it, life has passed you by.\u201d"

      "Guyana\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement that Venezuela\u2019s plan violates a December 2022 agreement between the two countries to not trigger conflict or escalate tensions over the mineral- and oil-rich region comprising two-thirds of Guyana\u2019s land mass.",
      "\u201cThe people of Guyana\u2019s Essequibo region are Guyanese nationals who live in Guyana\u2019s sovereign territory,\" the ministry said. \u201cIt would be a flagrant violation of the most fundamental principles of international law, enshrined in the U.N. Charter, for Venezuela to attempt to conduct an election in Guyanese territory involving the participation of Guyanese nationals.\u201d",
      "The ministry said it would ask the International Court of Justice in The Netherlands for provisional measures to stop Venezuela in its tracks if it goes ahead with plans to elect a governor of Essequibo. It said plans by Venezuela to administratively incorporate Essequibo into Venezuela \u201cnot only jeopardize the judicial process but also undermine the authority of the court as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.\u201d",
      "Venezuela has always considered Essequibo as its own because the region was within its boundaries during the Spanish colonial period. It has long dismissed the border drawn by international arbitrators in 1899, when Guyana was still a British colony.",
      "After years of fruitless mediation, Guyana went to the world court in 2018, asking judges to rule that the 1899 border decision is valid and binding. Venezuela argues that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute effectively nullified the original arbitration.",
      "A ruling is not expected this year because Venezuela was given until late August to reply to arguments made by Guyana.",

Last month it captured the towns of Katale and Masisi, the latter located 80 kilometers (49 miles) west of the regional capital, Goma, a strategic entry point into the Congolese interior.",

      "The rebel group rose to prominence a decade ago when its fighters seized Goma, which borders Rwanda. It derives its name from a March 23, 2009, peace deal it accuses the Congolese government of not implementing. After lying largely dormant for a decade, M23 resurfaced in late 2021 and has since captured wide swathes of territory in eastern Congo.",

      "France\u2019s highest court, the Court of Cassation, last month upheld a conviction against Sarkozy of corruption and influence peddling while he was head of state. He was sentenced to one year under house arrest with an electronic bracelet. The case was revealed as investigative judges were listening to wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya inquiry.",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Police were out in force in Venezuela 's capital Thursday ahead of what the opposition hoped would be major protests against Friday's swearing-in of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for a third term following a disputed election.",
      "Protests remained limited as of Thursday morning and the usually busy streets of Caracas were relatively quiet. The scant presence of workers and near-absence of students on sidewalks, subway stations and plazas contrasted with the increasing number of heavily armed state security forces that have been deployed across the country since New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "In the late morning, a handful of opposition demonstrators began walking into the street in one part of the city and others who were on the sidewalk, hesitantly at first, joined them. Together, they began chanting \u201cFreedom! Freedom!\u201d",

      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from more than 80% of electronic voting machines, posted them online and said they showed its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had won with twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, has said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate."

      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that \u201cthe post-Cold War peace is well and truly over.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump and JD Vance are simply right when they say that Europe needs to do more to defend its own continent. It\u2019s myopia to pretend otherwise with Russia on the march,\u201d Lammy said during a speech in London setting out the center-left Labour government\u2019s approach to foreign policy, which he termed \u201cprogressive realism.\u201d",
      "Lammy said people often ask him when world affairs will get back to normal, and \"my answer is that they will not. Europe\u2019s future security is on a knife edge.\u201d",

      "Lammy said that while Trump\u2019s unpredictability and \u201cintensity of rhetoric\u201d were part of his signature style, \u201cwe can be guided not entirely by the rhetoric and the language, but by (his) actions as president.\u201d",

      "Those have been undermined by Trump ally Elon Musk, who has sent a torrent of incendiary tweets in recent days attacking Prime Minister Keir Starmer and demanding he be replaced and imprisoned.",
      "Lammy said he had \u201creal concerns about some of what I\u2019ve seen\u201d from Musk. But he said British officials have not asked Trump or members of his incoming administration to rein in the X and Tesla CEO.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran is reeling from a cratering economy and stinging military setbacks across its sphere of influence in the Middle East. Its bad times are likely to get worse once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House with his policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran.",
      "Facing difficulties at home and abroad, Iran last week began an unusual two-month-long military drill. It includes testing air defenses near a key nuclear facility and preparing for exercises in waterways vital to the global oil trade.",
      "The military flexing seems aimed at projecting strength, but doubts about its power are high after the past year's setbacks.",
      "The December overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who Iran supported for years with money and troops, was a major blow to its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d across the region. The \u201caxis\u201d had already been hollowed out by Israel\u2019s punishing offensives last year against two militant groups backed by Iran \u2013 Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel also attacked Iran directly on two occasions.",
      "An Iranian Revolutionary Guard general based in Syria offered a blunt assessment this week. \u201cI do not see it as a matter of pride that we lost Syria,\u201d Gen. Behrouz Esbati said, according to an audio recording of a speech he gave that was leaked to the media. \u201cWe lost. We badly lost. We blew it.\u201d",
      "At home, Iran\u2019s economy is in tatters.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have maintained stiff sanctions to deter it from developing nuclear weapons \u2014 and Iran's recent efforts to get them lifted through diplomacy have fallen flat. Pollution chokes the skies in the capital, Tehran, as power plants burn dirty fuel in their struggle to avoid outages during winter. And families are struggling to make ends meet as the Iranian currency, the rial, falls to record lows against the U.S. dollar.",
      "As these burdens rise, so does the likelihood of political protests, which have ignited nationwide in recent years over women's rights and the weak economy.",
      "How Trump chooses to engage with Iran remains to be seen. But on Tuesday he left open the possibility of the U.S. conducting preemptive airstrikes on nuclear sites where Iran is closer than ever to enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a military strategy,\u201d Trump told journalists at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida during a wide-ranging news conference. \u201cI\u2019m not answering questions on military strategy.\u201d",
      "Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, yet officials there increasingly suggest Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb.",
      "It's not just Trump or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime foe of Tehran, that paint Iran's nuclear program as a major threat. French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking Monday to French ambassadors in Paris, described Iran as \u201cthe main strategic and security challenge for France, the Europeans, the entire region and well beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe acceleration of its nuclear program is bringing us very close to the breaking point,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIts ballistic program threatens European soil and our interests.\"",
      "While Europe had previously been seen as more conciliatory toward Iran, its attitude has hardened. That's likely because of what Macron described as Tehran's \u201cassertive and fully identified military support\u201d of Russia since it's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "France, as well as Germany and the United Kingdom, had been part of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Under that deal, Iran limited its enrichment of uranium and drastically reduced its stockpile in exchange for the lifting of crushing, United Nations-backed economic sanctions. Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, and with those U.N. sanctions lifted, it provided cover for China's to purchase oil from Iran.",
      "But now France, Germany and the United Kingdom call Tehran's advances in its atomic program a \u201dnuclear escalation\" that needs to be addressed. That raises the possibility of Western nations pushing for what's called a \u201csnapback\u201d of those U.N. sanctions on Iran, which could be catastrophic for the Iranian economy. That \u201csnapback\u201d power expires in October.",
      "On Wednesday, Iran released a visiting Italian journalist, Cecilia Sala, after detaining her for three weeks \u2014 even though she had received the government's approval to report from there.",
      "Sala's arrest came days after Italian authorities arrested an Iranian engineer accused by the U.S. of supplying drone technology used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops. The engineer remains in Italian custody.",
      "The length of the military drills started by Iran's armed forces and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard may be unusual, but their intended message to the U.S. and Israel \u2014 and to its domestic audience \u2014 is not. Iran is trying to show itself as capable of defending against any possible attack.",
      "On Tuesday, Iran held air-defense drills around its underground nuclear enrichment facility in the city of Natanz. It claimed it could intercept a so-called \u201cbunker buster\u201d bomb designed to destroy such sites.",
      "However, the drill did not involve any of its four advanced S-300 Russian air defense systems, which Israel targeted in its strikes on Iran. At least two are believed to have been damaged, and Israeli officials claim all have been taken out.",
      "\u201cSome of the U.S. and Israeli reservations about using force to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program have dissipated,\u201d wrote Kenneth Katzman, a longtime Iran analyst for the U.S. government who is now at the New York-based Soufan Center. \u201cIt appears likely that, at the very least, the Trump administration would not assertively dissuade Israel from striking Iranian facilities, even if the United States might decline to join the assault.\u201d",
      "There are other ways Iran could respond. This weekend, naval forces plan exercises in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Iran for years has threatened to close the strait \u2014 a narrow lane through which a fifth of global oil supplies are transported \u2014 and it has targeted oil tankers and other ships in those waters since 2019.",
      "\u201cHarassment and seizures are likely to remain the main tools of Iranian counteraction,\u201d the private maritime security firm Ambrey warned Thursday.",
      "Its allies may not be much help, though. The tempo of attacks on shipping lanes by Yemen's Houthi rebels, long armed by Iran, have slowed. And Iran has growing reservations about the reliability of Russia.",
      "In the recording of the speech by the Iranian general, Esbati, he alleges that Russia \u201cturned off all radars\u201d in Syria to allow an Israeli airstrike that hit a Guard intelligence center.",
      "Esbati also said Iranian missiles \u201cdon't have so much of an impact\u201d and that the U.S. would retaliate against any attack targeting its bases in the region.",
      "\u201cFor the time being and in this situation, dragging the region into a military operation does not agree (with the) interest of the resistance,\u201d he says.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland's President Andrzej Duda is asking the country's government to ensure that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.",
      "Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world's top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.",
      "There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation in 1945 of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan. 27.",
      "As a signatory to the treaty of the International Criminal Court, which issued the warrant for Netanyahu\u2019s arrest, Poland would have an obligation to arrest him. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.",
      "The court has more than 120 member states, though some countries have already said that they would not arrest him, including France.",
      "The commemoration will be attended by international officials and elderly survivors. It is to take place in Oswiecim, a town that was under German occupation during World War II where the Nazi German forces operated the most notorious of its death camps.",
      "More than 1.1 million people were murdered at Auschwitz. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.",
      "Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.",
      "Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that \u201call instruments\u201d related to ensuring Netanyahu\u2019s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk\u2019s government.",
      "Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.",
      "Paprocka said Duda's office was still waiting for a reply.",

      "BANGKOK -- An airstrike by Myanmar\u2019s army on a village under the control of an armed ethnic minority group killed about 40 people and injured at least 20 others, officials of the group and a local charity said Thursday. They said hundreds of houses burned in a fire triggered by the bombing.",
      "The attack occurred Wednesday in Kyauk Ni Maw village on Ramree island, an area controlled by the ethnic Arakan Army in western Rakhine state, they said. The military has not announced any attack in the area.",
      "The situation in the village could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and cellphone service in the area mostly cut off.",
      "Myanmar is wracked by violence that began when the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. After the army used lethal force to suppress peaceful demonstrations, many opponents of military rule took up arms and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press that a jet fighter bombed the village on Wednesday afternoon, killing 40 civilians and injuring more than 20 others.",
      "\u201cAll the dead were civilians. Among the dead and injured are women and children,\u201d Khaing Thukha said. A fire started by the airstrike spread through the village, destroying more than 500 houses, Khaing Thukha added.",
      "It was unclear why the village was targeted. The leader of a local charity group and independent media also reported the airstrike and casualties.",
      "The military government has stepped up airstrikes over the past three years on armed pro-democracy groups collectively known as the People\u2019s Defense Force and on armed ethnic minority groups that have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy. The two groups sometimes carry out joint operations against the army.",
      "Ramree, 340 kilometers (210 miles) northwest of Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, was captured by the Arakan Army in March last year.",
      "The Arakan Army is the well-trained and well-armed military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority movement which seeks autonomy from Myanmar\u2019s central government. It is also a member of an alliance of armed ethnic groups that recently gained strategic territory in the country\u2019s northeast on the border with China.",
      "It began its offensive in Rakhine in November 2023 and has now gained control of a strategically important regional army headquarters and 14 of Rakhine\u2019s 17 townships, leaving only the state\u2019s capital, Sittwe, and two important townships near Ramree still in military government hands.",
      "A leader of the charity group, which has been assisting residents of the village, told AP on Thursday that at least 41 people were killed and 50 others were injured in the airstrike, which targeted the village\u2019s market.",
      "The leader, who was away from the town at the time of the airstrike, spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns. He said he received the information from members of his group who were in the village and were facing a shortage of medicine to treat the injured people.",
      "Rakhine-based news outlets including Arakan Princess Media also reported the attack and posted photos online showing people putting out fires at their homes.",
      "Rakhine, formerly known as Arakan, was the site of a brutal army counterinsurgency operation in 2017 that drove about 740,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to seek safety across the border in Bangladesh.",

      "\u201cI never talked about this with Musk. It\u2019s not my habit to use my public role to do favors to friends,\u201d Meloni said, responding to reporters\u2019 questions during her start-of-the-year press conference on a possible deal with Musk\u2019s group over Italian telecoms security.",
      "Meloni stressed that national interest was \u201cthe only lens\u201d through which she judged such potential contracts with SpaceX, the owner of satellite system Starlink.",
      "Reportedly worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) and spread over five years, the project sparked an outcry by Italy's opposition parties, questioning that the handling of such communications could be handed to a Musk company.",
      "If the deal is sealed, SpaceX would provide encryption services for the Italian government and communications infrastructure for the military and emergency services.",
      "Earlier this week, Meloni denied forging such a deal with Musk \u2013 who has developed a friendly relationship with the Italian premier. A government statement went even further, \u201ccategorically\u201d denying that a SpaceX deal was discussed during Meloni\u2019s recent meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "\u201cSpaceX allows very delicate information to be communicated securely on a diplomatic and military level,\u201d Meloni told Thursday\u2019s press conference. \u201cRegarding the method, I can say that these are discussions that the government has with many private companies.\u201d",
      "Meloni reiterated that the government is still in an \u201cinvestigative\u201d phase and no contracts have been signed. \u201cThe issue is that there are no public alternatives for these technologies, obviously it\u2019s a question of placing data protection in the hands of a private entity. But the alternative is not having these data protected,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBoth scenarios are not ideal \u2026 If one day communications of sensitive data end up in the wrong hands, the government is responsible,\u201d she added.",
      "SpaceX has been approached by email for comment.",
      "Meloni also noted that Musk\u2019s political ideas could have been the real reason behind the controversy.",
      "\u201cIs the problem related to private investments or to the political ideas of the investors?\u201d she asked the press conference\u2019s audience.",
      "Musk, who\u2019s a close ally of Trump, has openly expressed his enthusiasm for a possible collaboration with Rome, writing on X that his company is \u201cready to provide Italy the most secure and advanced connectivity.\u201d",
      "Already active in Italy since 2021, Starlink could expand its services to include emergencies, such as disasters or terrorist attacks. Musk\u2019s group is also developing another project for defence and sensitive operations called Starshield.",
      "Experts in the security field have stressed the increasing sensitivity of European countries sealing partnerships with SpaceX, whose success has put increasing pressure on Europe\u2019s satellite and telecoms industry."

      "Premier Giorgia Meloni says she doesn't believe President-elect Donald Trump actually intends to use military force to seize control of Greenland or the Panama Canal",
      "ROME -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said Thursday she didn\u2019t believe President-elect Donald Trump actually intends to use military force to seize control of Greenland or the Panama Canal, saying she read his comments more as a warning to China and other global players to keep their hands off such strategically important interests.",
      "\u201cI think we can exclude that the United States in the coming years will try to use force to annex territory that interests it,\u201d said Meloni, who travelled last weekend to visit Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate and intends to attend his inauguration.",
      "Rather, she said, Trump\u2019s comments were \u201ca message to some other big global players more than any hostile claim over these countries.\u201d",
      "She identified increased \u201cChinese protagonism\u201d in the commercially important Panama Canal and resource-rich Greenland as being behind Trump's warning and said she interpreted his words as part of a \u201clong-distance debate between great powers.\u201d",
      "Meloni was speaking at an annual press conference during which she was peppered with questions about her relations with Trump and Elon Musk. She confirmed she hoped to attend Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, but was checking her agenda before confirming her presence.",
      "Trump on Tuesday said he wouldn't rule out the use of military force to seize control of the Panama Canal and Greenland which he declared to be vital to American national security.",
      "Analysts say such rhetoric could embolden America\u2019s enemies by suggesting the U.S. is now OK with countries using force to redraw borders at a time when Russia is pressing forward with its invasion of Ukraine and China is threatening Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory.",
      "Meloni's press conference came a day after her right-wing government scored a major political victory by welcoming home an Italian journalist who had been detained in Iran for three weeks.",
      "The case of Cecilia Sala had become intertwined with that of an Iranian engineer detained in Italy on a U.S. warrant, who is wanted by the United States in connection with a 2024 drone attack in Jordan that killed three American soldiers.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we\u2019ve created,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cNo matter what\u2019s going on in the world, everyone wants to feel sure that their country will not just be erased of the map.\u201d",
      "Austin also announced the U.S. would send another $500 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including missiles for fighter jets, sustainment equipment for F-16s, armored bridging systems and small arms and ammunition.",

      "Zelenskyy called the Kursk offensive \u201cone of our biggest wins\u201d that has cost Russia and North Korea, which sent soldiers to help Russia in Kursk, thousands of troops. Zelenskyy said the offensive resulted in North Korea suffering 4,000 casualties, but U.S. estimates put the number lower at about 1,200.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine will continue to need air defense systems and munitions to defend against Russia's missile attacks.",
      "The latest U.S. package leaves about $3.85 billion in funding to provide future arms shipments to Ukraine. If the Biden administration makes no further announcements, that balance will be available to President-elect Donald Trump to send if he chooses.",
      "\u201cIf Putin swallows Ukraine, his appetite will only grow,\u201d Austin told the approximately 50 member nations who have been meeting over the last three years to coordinate weapons and military support for Ukraine. \u201cIf autocrats conclude that democracies will lose their nerve, surrender their interests, and forget their principles, we will only see more land grabs. If tyrants learn that aggression pays, we will only invite even more aggression, chaos, and war.\u201d",
      "Austin leaves a consortium that now has more than a half dozen independent coalitions of those countries who are focused on Ukraine's longer-term security capabilities and who have committed to continuing to stand up those needs through 2027.",
      "In the months since Trump's victory, Europe has grappled with what that change will mean in terms of their fight to keep Russia from further advancing, and whether the post-World War II western alliance will hold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cA time when we will have to cooperate even more, rely even more on one another even more and achieve even greater results together.\u201d",
      "Globally, countries including the U.S. have ramped up domestic weapons production as the Ukraine war exposed that all of those stockpiles were woefully unprepared for a major conventional land war.",

      "\u201cRetreat will only provide incentives for more imperial aggression,\u201d Austin told the group. \u201cAnd if we flinch, you can count on Putin to push further and punch harder. Ukraine\u2019s survival is on the line. But so is the security of Europe, the United States, and the world.\u201d",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- A prominent Vietnamese lawyer went on trial Thursday for Facebook posts that allegedly criticized the country's former top judge, in a case that human rights groups said could have a chilling effect on expression in the country.",
      "Tran Dinh Trien was arrested last June for three Facebook posts that allegedly criticized the actions of then-Chief Justice Nguyen Hoa Binh, according to Human Rights Watch and rights group Project 88. Trien was charged under Article 331 of the Penal Code with \u201cabusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state,\u201d Project 88 said.",
      "Trien, 65, is a former deputy director of the Hanoi Bar Association who has been involved in many high-profile legal cases. The trial is expected to last two days, with 12 lawyers defending him, according to Vietnamese state media. He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted.",
      "In his postings, Trien wrote that courts prevented family members of defendants from attending trials, barred journalists and lawyers from video recording at open trials, and criticized then-Chief Justice Binh for ruling against a death row inmate, Ho Duy Hai, despite irregularities in the investigation, Human Rights Watch said. The top court accused Trien of fabricating and spreading false information that tarnished Binh and the legal system.",
      "Trien was arrested on the same day as prominent journalist and historian Truong Huy San, a week after Public Security Minister To Lam became the Communist country's new president. Two months after Trien's arrest, Binh was appointed the country\u2019s deputy prime minister.",
      "Project 88 said Trien's prosecution violated international law which provides for open political debate and the right to criticize public officials.",
      "\u201cIf convicted, Trien\u2019s prosecution will set a dangerous precedent for other lawyers in Vietnam. It will also have a chilling effect on the general population, who will be less likely to voice criticism of their unelected leaders and government officials on social media,\u201d the group said.",
      "Human Rights Watch said Trien was the latest in a series of prominent lawyers targeted for their social media posts. It said at least four Vietnamese lawyers have sought asylum in the United States in the past two years for fear of arrest.",
      "Vietnamese authorities have also increasingly used Article 331 to silence government critics, with courts convicting and sentencing at least 24 people under the article last year alone, it said. \u201cThe government should immediately drop all charges against Trien and free him and others prosecuted for the peaceful expression of their political views,\u201d it added.",
      "The 2024 World Press Freedom Index issued by Reporters Without Borders ranks Vietnam at 174th out of 180 countries and territories.

      "The island\u2019s navy highlighted its Kuang Hua VI fast attack missile boats and Tuo Chiang-class corvettes in waters near Taiwan\u2019s largest port of Kaohsiung, a major hub for international trade considered key to resupplying Chinese forces should they establish a beachhead on the island.",
      "The Kuang Hua VI boats, with a crew of 19, carry indigenously developed Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles and displayed their ability to take to the sea in an emergency to intercept enemy ships about to cross the 44-kilometer (24-nautical mile) limit of Taiwan\u2019s contiguous zone, within which governments are permitted to take defensive action.",
      "China routinely sends ships and planes to challenge Taiwan\u2019s willingness and ability to counter intruders, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets, activate missile systems and dispatch warships. Taiwan demanded on Wednesday that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said is undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and disrupting international shipping and trade.",
      "Mountainous Taiwan's strategy is to counter the much larger Chinese military with a relatively flexible defense that can prevent Chinese troops from crossing the strait. Landing sites are few on Taiwan's west coast facing China, forcing Beijing to focus on the east coast.",
      "Hsiao Shun-ming, captain of a Tuo Chiang-class corvette, said his ship\u2019s relatively small size still allows it to \u201cdeliver a formidable competitive power\u201d against larger Chinese ships. The Tuo Chiang has a catamaran design and boasts high speeds and considerable stealth ability.",

      "Mozambique\u2019s main opposition leader has returned from self-imposed exile as security forces fired tear gas at hundreds of his supporters who gathered near the main international airport to welcome him home",
      "MAPUTO, Mozambique -- MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) \u2014 Mozambique's main opposition leader returned from self-imposed exile on Thursday clutching a bible and saying he still rejects the results of a disputed election last year that has sparked more than two months of protests and a violent crackdown by security forces.",
      "While Venancio Mondlane stepped off a plane, security forces fired tear gas at hundreds of his supporters who gathered near the main international airport to welcome him home. Mondlane arrived at Mavalane International Airport in the capital, Maputo, to applause from some airport workers and then kneeled in the arrivals hall with a bible in his left hand.",
      "\u201cI want to fight within this country and I will, until the very end, keep fighting for this country,\u201d Mondlane said. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to accept election results if they are the same as those announced up until now.\u201d",
      "He had left the country in October following an election clouded by allegations of rigging against the long-ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power since Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975.",
      "More than 100 people have been killed by security forces, according to international rights groups, since Mozambique erupted in protests after Frelimo was declared the winner of the Oct. 9 election. Some local groups put the death toll at more than 200. Mondlane had called for people to protest the results.",
      "Mondlane has said he left Mozambique fearing for his life after two senior members of his opposition party were killed in their car by unknown gunmen in a late-night shooting on a street in Maputo in the aftermath of the election. Mondlane's party called the killings political assassinations.",
      "Police on Thursday also blocked roads leading to the airport after Mondlane said on social media earlier this week he would return to the southern African country. Tear gas drifted over the airport and surrounding roads and a helicopter hovered overhead. After arriving, Mondlane traveled by car to a public square in central Maputo, with large crowds following him.",
      "Thousands of Mondlane's supporters were expected to gather in Maputo for his return, prompting the clampdown by security forces, which rights groups have accused of using excessive force against post-election protesters. Authorities have said the protests were violent and needed to be subdued, but rights groups say security forces have fired live bullets at peaceful protesters, and children were among those who were killed.",
      "Mondlane accused authorities of kidnapping and killing some anti-government protesters. But he also said he was willing to enter into negotiations with Frelimo to end months of unrest, which has disrupted the country of 33 million. Mozambique has also been battling a violent insurgency by jihadists in the north.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here in flesh and blood to say that if you want to negotiate, if you want to talk to me, if you want to come to the conversation table, I\u2019m here,\u201d Mondlane said.",
      "Mondlane and other opposition candidates accused Frelimo of rigging the election and international observers reported irregularities in the vote and the alteration of some results. Mozambique\u2019s Constitutional Council upheld Frelimo\u2019s victory last month, making its candidate, Daniel Chapo, the president-elect. He is due to be inaugurated next week to succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served the maximum two terms.",
      "Mondlane was second in the official results.",
      "The post-election unrest has spilled over to neighboring countries, with reports of thousands of Mozambicans fleeing to Malawi. South Africa closed its border with Mozambique for several days last year after vehicles were set on fire near the crossing.",
      "The Southern African Development Community, a regional body, has said it will send a delegation to Mozambique in an attempt to find a solution to end the turmoil.",
      "Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections since Mozambique held its first democratic vote in 1994 following a bloody 15-year civil war Frelimo fought against rebel group Renamo, which is now an opposition party that Mondlane once belonged to before breaking away.",
      "The street protests in several major cities since October have been the biggest threat to Frelimo's rule since the 1977-1992 civil war.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 15:15:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
    "story": [
      "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData.",
      "With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default.",
      "A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower won't pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire.",
      "Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir.",
      "\u201cThese are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people don't realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should know about credit card defaults.",
      "There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesn't pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card \u201cdelinquent\u201d and the borrower's credit scores can be damaged further.",
      "When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub.",
      "\u201cThat's where you're going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while,\u201d said Lupo.",
      "When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower.",
      "The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether it\u2019s reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, it\u2019s easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it,\u201d said Sotir",
      "Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since it\u2019s in the bank\u2019s best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor.",
      "It's best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company.",
      "\u201cDo whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If you're 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default,\u201d said Bandebo.",
      "If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan.",
      "Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee.",
      "Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you don't pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo.",
      "Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time.",
      "\u201cThere's not miracle solutions that once you've missed a payment, or you've gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You can't just flip a switch,\" said Bandebo.",
      "If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income.",
      "\u201cFor most people, it's really about understanding how much money is coming in and where it's going,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who can\u2019t afford large and high-interest credit card balances.",
      "Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo.",
      "If your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to resume payments, it\u2019s important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo.",

      "A senior official says Canada is looking at putting retaliatory tariffs on American orange juice, sinks, toilets and some steel products if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump goes ahead with his threat to impose 25% on all Canadian products",
      "TORONTO -- Canada is looking at putting retaliatory tariffs on American orange juice, toilets and some steel products if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump follows through with his threat to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products, a senior official familiar with the matter said Thursday.",
      "The official said the wide-ranging list is still being worked on and has not been completed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "Trump said this week he will use economic coercion to pressure Canada to become the nation\u2019s 51st state. And he continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Yogurt imports from Wisconsin and whiskey from Kentucky, the home states of top Republicans Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell respectively, were hit with 10% duties in 2018.",
      "Citrus production largely happens in Florida, now Trump\u2019s home state.",
      "Trump said this week the U.S doesn\u2019t need anything from Canada, including automobiles, lumber and dairy products. Supply chains for the auto industry are deeply connected, with parts manufactured in Ontario being used in cars that are assembled in Detroit and then sold back to Canada.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford has noted that in the auto sector alone parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times.",
      "Ford, the leader of Canada's most populous province, said Trump has been misinformed about the U.S. not needing Canadian products and warned that Canada will retaliate if Trump imposes tariffs. He said a wide range of U.S. products shipped to Canada will be targeted, but he declined to specify which ones.",
      "Top Canadian government officials say Trump\u2019s comments that Canada should become the 51st state are no longer a joke and are meant to undermine America\u2019s closest ally.",
      "\u201cThe joke is over,\u201d Dominic LeBlanc, the country\u2019s finance minister and point person for U.S.-Canada relations, said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for him, I think, to sow confusion, to agitate people, to create chaos knowing this will never happen.\u201d",
      "LeBlanc has been talking to incoming Trump Cabinet officials about a billion-dollar plan to increase border security in an effort to deflect Trump's threat of tariffs.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Trump initially threatened to impose tariffs on all Canadian goods if Canada and Mexico do not stem the flow of migrants and fentanyl from crossing the U.S. border \u2014 even though far fewer of each enters the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico.",
      "On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border pale in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",

      "The uptick in the cost of home loans reflects a rise in the bond yields that lenders use as a guide to price mortgages, specifically the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has climbed from 3.62% in mid-September to 4.66% this week.",
      "The increase is occurring with the price of homes rising steadily.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept homeownership out of reach of many would-be homebuyers. While sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November for the second straight month, the housing market remains in a slump and on track for its worst year since 1995.",

      "Two hundred Utah ski patrollers returned to work Thursday after voting to accept a new labor contract and end a nearly two-week strike that closed many trails and caused long lift lines at the ones that remained open during a busy time of year at the country's biggest ski resort.",
      "The Park City Ski Professional Ski Patrol Association claimed victory, saying in a statement that Colorado-based Vail Resorts, which owns Park City Mountain Resort, acceded to its key demands including a $2-an-hour base-pay increase and raises for senior ski patrollers.",
      "\"This contract is more than just a win for our team \u2014 it\u2019s a groundbreaking success in the ski and mountain worker industry. This effort demonstrates what can be achieved when workers stand together and fight for what they deserve,\u201d ski patroller and union lead negotiator Seth Dromgoole said in a statement.",
      "Union negotiators and Vail Resorts announced Tuesday that they had reached a tentative deal. The full union voted Wednesday to accept the agreement.",
      "The strike began Dec. 27 after negotiations that started in March bogged down and the union accused Vail Resorts of bargaining unfairly. The strike coincided with the busy holiday season and a period of more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of fresh but difficult-to-access snowfall at the resort.",
      "Despite the closed trails and long lift lines, some skiers expressed support for the strikers, chanting \u201cPay your employees!\u201d in videos posted on social media.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to welcoming back the Park City Mountain patrollers in the coming days and moving forward together as one team. We apologize to our guests who were impacted by this strike and are incredibly grateful to our team who worked hard to keep the mountain open and operating safely over the past two weeks,\" Bill Rock, Vail Resorts' mountain division president, said in a statement.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. It said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "Park City, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City, is a resort town of about 8,000 people where the average home price tops $1.5 million and living costs are well above average.",

      "Vail Resorts, which with 42 properties on three continents calls itself the world\u2019s largest mountain resort operator, said it already had been generous with the Park City Mountain Resort ski patrollers, pointing to a 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It had been offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren\u2019t rare, but this strike happened after talks went much longer than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "\u201cThe issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling injured skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody is nearby. Many work other jobs in the summer, including as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides.",

Now, a fully autonomous tractor drives through his expansive orchard, spraying pesticides and fertilizer to protect the trees that have for decades filled him with an immense sense of pride.",
      "\u201cThe sustainability of doing things perfectly the first time makes a lot of sense,\u201d the first-generation farmer told The Associated Press at CES 2025, where John Deere unveiled a fleet of fully autonomous heavy equipment, including the tractor Maichel has been testing on his northern California farm.",

      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "The late New York Sen_ Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it this way decades ago: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,\u201d the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan memorably wrote four decades ago.",
      "That seems like a simpler time \u2014 especially when you consider Meta's decision to end a fact-checking program on social media apps Facebook, Instagram and Threads and what the ramifications might be for an industry built to bring clarity and to seek truth itself.",
      "Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg's announcement this week was widely seen in news verification circles as a genuflection to president-elect Donald Trump, whose first term in office popularized the phrase \u201calternative facts.\u201d",
      "Meta is replacing its fact-checking with a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system reminiscent of X, where it depends on users to correct misinformation on its platforms. In a way, that hearkens back to \u201che said-she said\u201d journalism, or the view of some political debate moderators that it should be the role of opponents, not journalists, to point out falsehoods. It also hints at something else: the notion that the loudest voices and the best-told stories can win the day.",
      "The moment is a crossroads for the fact-checking industry, which will see its influence sharply curtailed when Trump takes office for his second term.",
      "\u201cIn the short term, this is bad news for people who want to go on social media to find trustworthy and accurate information,\u201d said Angie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network. Her organization started in 2015 with about 50 members and now has 170, some of whom face staff cuts and potential closure because of Meta's move.",
      "\u201cIn the long term,\" she said, \"I think it\u2019s very uncertain what this will all mean.\u201d",
      "Fact-checking is an odd industry, particularly when you consider that it's a function of all journalism. The concept bubbled up about three decades ago in part to counter \u201che said-she said\u201d stories and monitor claims in political ads. The organization FactCheck.org, whose primary aim was to help reporters, started in 2003 and the more public-facing PolitiFact four years later.",
      "PolitiFact, started by then-Tampa Bay Times Washington bureau chief Bill Adair in 2007, won a Pulitzer Prize for its 2008 campaign coverage. It called out politicians for bending or breaking the truth in ways often difficult for reporters who were protective of the sources whose voices populated their stories.",
      "By 2012, fact-checkers were under attack, primarily by Republicans convinced many were biased and researched voting records to try and prove the point, said Adair, now a Duke University professor. Trump, he said, \u201csped up a trend that had already begun.\u201d",
      "Some conservative suspicion of fact-checkers has been warranted because of mistakes that have been made, although there were some Republicans who uttered falsehoods and just didn\u2019t like being called out for it, said Steve Hayes, CEO and editor of the center-right site The Dispatch.",
      "\u201cThe people who practice fact-checking are in some ways saying, \u2019We are the arbiter of truth, period,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cAnd anytime you do this, it invites scrutiny on the work that you do.\u201d",
      "Labeling systems largely didn't help, either. Giving a misstatement the label of \u201cpants on fire,\u201d as some fact-checkers have, may be a catchy way of attracting attention but also fostered resentment.",
      "Holan resists the view that fact-checkers have been biased in their work: \u201cThat attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.\"",
      "GOP suspicion still quickly took root. Journalism's Poynter Institute, in a survey taken in 2019, found that 70% of Republicans thought the work of fact-checkers was one-sided. Roughly the same percentage of Democrats thought they were fair. Poynter hasn't asked the same question since. Yet last year, Poynter found that 52% of Americans say they generally find it difficult to determine whether what they're reading about elections is true or not.",
      "In a column Wednesday on the conservative watchdog site NewsBusters.org, Tim Graham wrote that during the first nine months of 2024, PolitiFact criticized Republican officials for delivering \u201cmostly false\u201d facts 88 times compared to 31 times for Democrats. To Graham, this proves that the idea the site is independent or nonpartisan is laughable.",
      "But is that bias? Or is it checking facts?",
      "Adair used to be reluctant to say what is now the title of his new book: \u201cBeyond the Big Lie: The Epidemic of Political Lying, Why Republicans Do it More, and How it Could Burn Down Our Democracy.\u201d He's not hesitant anymore.",
      "\u201cTrump is unmatched as a liar in American politics,\u201d Adair said. \u201cI'm not the first to say that. I think he has capitalized on the fact that there has been this pushback on fact-checkers, and showed other politicians that you can get away with lying, so go ahead and do that.\u201d",
      "Tension about fact-checking played out during the recent presidential campaign, when Trump's team was furious with ABC News for calling attention to false statements by the former president during his only debate with Democrat Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump's second victory has changed the equation at Meta. Already, X has curtailed its independent fact-checking under owner Elon Musk, a Trump ally. The moves are significant because it removes fact-checking from venues where many users might not otherwise be exposed to it.",
      "On its own, fact-checking \u201cdoesn't reach those exposed to misinformation,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania, who started FactCheck.org. \u201cIt tends to reach audiences that were already knowledgeable and wary.\u201d",
      "On social media, fact-checking also became part of the algorithms that drove information to people, or away from them. Material labeled as false would often be downgraded so it received less exposure. To Republicans who have criticized Big Tech, that amounted to censorship. Yet to Jamieson, successful fact-checking is not censorship \u2014 \u201cit's the process of arguing.\"",
      "Jamieson expressed some optimism that other smart social media users will step up to prevent the dangerous spread of falsehoods. But for fact-checking as it is today to continue to thrive and, even, exist as a journalistic endeavor, Adair said it will likely take influential Republican figures to publicly stand up for the importance of truth.",
      "NewsBuster columnist Graham, in an interview, had a more pointed piece of advice. \u201cMy remedy in all arguments about media trust,\" he said, \u201cis that humility is required.\u201d",

      "For Jan. 9",
      "LONDON -- The new year is always a good time to make a fresh start \u2014 including with your email inbox. To kick off 2025 with a clean slate, why not clear out all those unnecessary and unwanted messages?",
      "If you're anything like me, you'll have piles of messages that have been accumulating in your inbox: receipts, bank and credit card statements, mobile phone bills, plane tickets, restaurant bookings, reminders, security warnings, spam and more.",
      "Mixed in with all that administrative detritus might be some personal missives from friends and family that are worth keeping.",
      "There are several reasons to purge all that digital clutter. For one, it cuts the risk in case of a data breach. If hackers somehow gain access to your email, they won't have any personal or financial info like credit card details to pilfer.",
      "A decluttered inbox also helps boost productivity and focus because it's easier to find important messages if you don't have to sift through reams of irrelevant ones.",
      "Some productivity proponents advocate inbox zero, a practice that requires dealing with each email that comes in so that by the end of the day your inbox is empty.",
      "But who has the time and energy for that? If you're busy, it's easier to just deal with the messages that need immediate attention and ignore the rest. That is, until the backlog becomes too big.",
      "Here are some tricks to tame your inbox by culling unwanted emails from important ones:",
      "Email accounts used to have limited storage space, say a gigabyte or two at most, which meant that messages with big attachments took up lots of space. Nowadays, email comes with plenty of free storage but it's still good practice to clear out oversized messages because they tend to build up over time. Do you really need to keep all those high-resolution photos of a forgotten friend's grandchildren?",
      "In Microsoft Outlook, click on the \u201cSize\u201d column or button to float the biggest messages to the top, where you can go through and delete them. Outlook also lets users sort by attachment so that messages with added files show at the top. If you want to save the message itself, right click on the attachment to remove it.",
      "In Gmail, go to the search settings to filter out messages that are \u201cgreater than\u201d a certain size. Start at, say, 20 megabytes, and then gradually reduce the number.",
      "Emails from frequent automated senders, such as newsletters and mailing lists, can take up a lot of space in your inbox. Or perhaps you get a lot of security notifications from your bank that might be important in the moment but quickly become outdated.",
      "It's often too tedious to delete them individually so filter your inbox by sender to delete them as a group. In Outlook click the \u201cFrom\u201d column or button. In Gmail or Yahoo mail, use the search bar to look for the sender's email address.",
      "Combine this with another search trick that narrows down the date range to filter out all those old emails that you never got around to deleting. In Outlook or Gmail, you can set a date range to capture emails from, for example, 2010 to 2017, so that you can get rid of, say, all those utility bills you don't need anymore.",
      "Emails from mailing lists tend to include certain words or language that makes it a bit easier to filter them out. One such obvious term is \u201cunsubscribe.\" Searching for a word like that, which wouldn't normally be used in emails written by humans, will identify all the newsletters for easy deletion.",
      "Copying everyone onto an email chain could be viewed as polite and courteous \u2014 or annoying, depending on whether the message topic is relevant to you. Sure, it's a good idea to CC everyone in the office about an important policy that applies to all staff but maybe not about a meeting about Bring Your Child to Work Day if you don't have kids.",
      "In Outlook there's a hack to filter out all those emails where you're not the main recipient. Go to the Home tab, click \u201cRules,\u201d and then \u201cCreate\u201d a rule. Go to Advanced Options, and tick \u201cwhere my name is in the cc box.\" For the next step, you can tick the box to move it to a folder, or even permanently delete it if you're feeling confident.",
      "Gmail users can do something similar with the search function. Type cc: and your email address.",
      "Perhaps you've tried out all these various hacks and whittled down your backlog but still have many more that you haven't gone through. Then it could be time to consider the nuclear option: delete everything.",
      "The benefit of this approach is that it really does provide you with a blank slate. You'll have no more mental anxiety if you don't have any more messages to worry about. The drawback, of course, is that you might lose any messages that might be important or precious.",

Donald Trump's presidency could mean big policy shifts in tax and other incentives for both electric vehicle makers and consumers. The threat of tariffs on imports and retaliatory tariffs globally, could further complicate production and sales for electric vehicles.",

      "In the U.S., consumers can currently claim a federal tax benefit of up to $7,500 for certain new electric vehicles. Carmakers also benefitted from some federal support for electric vehicle production and infrastructure. It's possible for all of that to get cut under President Trump.",
      "Trump condemned the federal tax credit for electric vehicles while campaigning for the presidency. He called it part of a \u201cgreen new scam\u201d that would would hurt the auto industry. Still, the incoming administration is expected push for broader deregulation of industries, which could potentially help carmakers.",

      "Tariffs are another threat to the industry. Production takes place globally, with parts getting imported and exported throughout the process. Trump has threatened to tax imports from Mexico, Canada, China and elsewhere, which would likely result in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "China is the largest market for electric vehicles, followed by the U.S. Within the U.S., Tesla is the dominant electric vehicle maker, with about 50% of the market share.",
      "Automakers are in a wait-and-see position along with many other industries to see whether Trump carries out the threat of rescinding tax credits and implementing tariffs.",
      "The broader auto industry is proceeding with caution. Overall, S&P Global Mobility expects that light vehicle production will have slid 1.6% in 2024 and will fall another 0.4% in 2025.",
      "That's a result of automakers better matching production and demand. Overall light vehicle sales are still expected to rise 1.7% in 2025.",
      "The ongoing transition to electric vehicles also plays a role in more tempered production. Companies like Ford and General Motors are shifting production capacity to electric vehicles in some cases instead of adding more capacity."

      "The U.S. Interior Department says that no bids were submitted for this week\u2019s oil and gas lease sale in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The U.S. Interior Department on Wednesday said no bids were submitted for this week's oil and gas lease sale in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 a sale the state has challenged as too restrictive and at odds with a 2017 law aimed at opening the refuge's sweeping coastal plan to exploration and development.",
      "Monday was the deadline for companies to submit bids, the agency said.",
      "Interior Acting Deputy Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said the lack of interest by oil companies in pursuing leases in the refuge's coastal plain \u201creflects what we and they have known all along \u2013 there are some places too special and sacred to put at risk with oil and gas drilling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe oil and gas industry is sitting on millions of acres of undeveloped leases elsewhere; we\u2019d suggest that\u2019s a prudent place to start, rather than engage further in speculative leasing in one of the most spectacular places in the world,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "But this is unlikely to be the last word. The state this week sued the Interior Department and federal officials over the sale, alleging among other things that the terms were too restrictive. The state also is seeking to have the environmental review underpinning the sale thrown out. Litigation around the first lease sale \u2014 held in the waning days of the Trump administration in early 2021 \u2014 also is still pending.",
      "A 2017 law that President-elect Donald Trump has often highlighted called for offering two lease sales in the refuge\u2019s coastal plain by late 2024. Major oil companies sat out the first sale, which saw a state corporation as the main bidder. One of President Joe Biden\u2019s first acts as president was to order a review of the leasing program, which ultimately led to the cancelation of seven remaining leases. Smaller companies had previously given up two other leases they'd held from that sale.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Interior Department, has said that it offered for lease as part of the smaller, second sale 400,000 acres (162,000 hectares), the minimum acreage required by the 2017 law. The agency said its proposal avoided important polar bear denning and caribou calving areas and had the smallest footprint of potential surface disturbance.",
      "Leaders in Gwich'in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, citing its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and oppose drilling there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling and see responsible oil development as critical to the economic wellbeing of communities in the region.",
      "Drilling advocates \u2014 including state political leaders \u2014 are hopeful Trump will pursue drilling in the refuge, seeing a potential to create jobs, generate additional revenue and spur U.S. oil production. But while the Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil there. And environmentalists contend the lack of interest by oil companies so far should speak volumes.",
      "\u201cThey seem to understand that drilling in this remote landscape is\u202ftoo risky, too complicated and just plain wrong,\u201d Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement. \"The incoming Trump administration still hasn\u2019t gotten the memo and has vowed to keep trying to sell the refuge for oil. We\u2019ll continue to use the power of the law to defend this cherished place, as we have for decades.\u201d"

      "Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes.",
      "Minutes from the meeting, released after the typical three-week lag, also showed clear division among the Fed's 19 policymakers. Some officials expressed support for keeping the central bank's key rate unchanged, the minutes said. And a majority of the officials said the decision to cut rates was a close call.",
      "Ultimately, the Fed choose to cut its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.3%. One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged.",
      "Still, there was widespread agreement in the minutes that after reducing rates for three straight meetings, Fed officials felt it was time to undertake a more deliberate approach to their key rate.",
      "Fewer rate cuts will likely mean that borrowing costs for consumers and businesses \u2014 including for homes, cars, and credit cards \u2014 will remain elevated this year.",
      "Policymakers said that the Fed \u201cwas at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing,\u201d the minutes said. In projections released after the meeting, Fed officials said they expect just two cuts next year, down from an earlier projection of four.",
      "Fed officials sent stock markets plummeting Dec. 18 after they reduced their outlook for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the meeting that the decision to reduce rates had been a \u201cclose call.\"",
      "Powell also said that recent signs of stubborn inflation have caused many Fed officials to pare back their expectations for rate cuts. Inflation, according to the Fed's preferred measure, ticked up to 2.4% in November, compared with a year ago, above the Fed's target. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, it was 2.8%.",
      "In addition, some officials have started to consider the potential impact of President-elect Trump's proposals, such as widespread tariffs, on the economy and inflation next year, the minutes said.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs, for example, have estimated that Trump's tariff proposals could push inflation by nearly a half-percentage point later this year.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he still supported rate reductions this year, in part because he expects inflation to steadily head down to the Fed's 2% target. He also said he didn't expect tariffs would worsen inflation and wouldn't change his preference for lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Waller also said, in a question and answer session, that he didn't think Trump would ultimately impose the universal tariffs he promised in the campaign."

      "Ski patrollers at the biggest U.S. ski resort have reached a deal to end a strike that put a wrench in operations during the busy holiday season",
      "Ski patrollers at the biggest U.S. ski resort reached a tentative deal with the corporate owner of Utah's Park City Mountain Resort to end a strike and resume normal operations after almost two weeks of closed terrain and long lift lines at the busiest time of year.",
      "Neither the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association nor Colorado-based Vail Resorts released details about the agreement ahead of a planned ratification vote Wednesday.",
      "Whatever happens, the strike brought attention \u2014 and judging from the many supportive car honks for strikers, sympathy \u2014 to the struggle of ski patrollers to make ends meet in pricey mountain communities.",
      "A union win could produce better pay for other ski workers, predicted one industry watcher.",
      "\u201cGenerally when one group of employees successfully bargains for a contract they think is fair, it does tend to create the \u2018rising tide lifts all boats\u2019 dynamic,\u201d said Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "Park City, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City, is a resort town of about 8,000 people where the average home price tops $1.5 million and the cost of living is well above average.",
      "The 200 ski patrollers at Park City Mountain Resort went on strike on Dec. 27 alleging unfair bargaining in negotiations since March. The tentative deal to be in effect through April 2027 had the unanimous approval of ski patrol negotiators, according to a joint statement from the union and the resort.",
      "\u201cEveryone looks forward to restoring normal resort operations and moving forward together as one team,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling hurt skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody\u2019s nearby. It\u2019s specialized work where familiarity with a resort\u2019s terrain and how to respond to a variety of injuries and situations can be valuable.",
      "It's also a seasonal job. Many ski patrollers work as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides in warmer months.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. The union said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "It also sought higher pay for the longest-serving patrollers. The current scale tops out after five years on the job.",
      "Vail Resorts, which with 42 properties on three continents calls itself the world\u2019s largest mountain resort operator, said it already had been generous with the Park City Mountain Resort ski patrollers, pointing to a 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It was offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren't unusual, but this strike happened after talks went much longer into the year than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Kaufman.",
      "\"The issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\" Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Despite long waits, even some Park City Mountain Resort skiers have been sympathetic to the workers. \u201cPay your employees!\u201d they chanted from lift lines in videos posted on social media.",
      "Labor unions have secured meaningful employer concessions in recent months following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "The 45,000 dockworkers\u2019 ongoing threats to resume their strike over automation would shut down ports and could damage the economy as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House."

      "WASHINGTON -- The IRS boosted taxpayer services through Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act but still faces processing claims from a coronavirus pandemic-era tax credit program and is slow to resolve certain identity theft cases, according to an independent watchdog report released Wednesday.",
      "\u201cFor the first time since I became the National Taxpayer Advocate in 2020, I can begin this report with good news: The taxpayer experience has noticeably improved,\u201d Erin M. Collins wrote in her 2024 annual report to Congress.",
      "She said \u201cthe IRS has made major strides\u201d with the help of the billions of dollars in multiyear funding, though she notes that \u201cIRS service remains far from perfect.\u201d",
      "Remaining service gaps include prolonged delays in resolving claims from the nearly half a million taxpayers whose identities were stolen by fraudsters who received a refund on their behalf. The delays have increased from 19 months in 2023 to 22 months in 2024, according to the report.",
      "In addition, the report says there have been lengthy delays in the resolution of eligible Employee Retention Credit claims submitted by employers who rely on those refunds to stay in business.",
      "The Employee Retention Credit, or ERC, was designed to help businesses retain employees during pandemic-era shutdowns, but it quickly became a magnet for fraud. Its complex eligibility rules allowed scammers to target small businesses, offering help applying for it for a fee \u2014 even if they didn\u2019t qualify.",
      "In September 2023, the IRS announced a pause in accepting claims for the tax credit until 2024 because of rising concerns that an influx of applications were fraudulent.",
      "\u201cAlthough the IRS has processed several hundred thousand claims in recent months, it was still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024,\" Collins said in her Wednesday report. \u201cMany claims have been pending for more than a year.\u201d",
      "IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said \u201cthings are trending in a very positive direction in terms of our performance in taxpayer service,\u201d but still, \u201cI view the identity theft issue as our largest current service gap.\u201d He said the agency is seeing higher numbers of theft victims overall since before the pandemic, in part because scammers are increasingly moving to online schemes.",
      "Werfel said the agency is adding more resources to the issue and streamlining identity theft cases by distinguishing between complex and simpler cases to resolve taxpayer issues faster.",
      "Among other recommendations, the taxpayer advocate is calling on Congress to expand the U.S. Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear refund cases, give the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic program more financial leeway to help taxpayers and require the IRS to process claims for refund or credits in a timely manner.",
      "Collins said many IRS improvements, including faster service and quicker phone response times, have been made possible by multiyear funding provided by Congress. However, that funding is at risk of being cut.",
      "The federal tax collection agency originally received an $80 billion infusion of funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, though a 2023 debt ceiling and budget cut deal between Republicans and the Democratic White House resulted in $1.4 billion rescinded from the agency and a separate agreement to take $20 billion from the IRS over the next two years and divert those funds to other nondefense programs.",
      "Now, Treasury Department officials are calling on Congress to unlock another $20 billion in IRS enforcement money that is tied up in legislative language that has effectively rendered the money frozen.",
      "Werfel said the boost in the IRS budget \u201chas played an absolutely critical role\" in improvements to taxpayer services. \u201cWe\u2019ve put the money to good use,\" he said.",
      "If Congress does slash Inflation Reduction Act enforcement funding, Collins recommends that it not make cuts to taxpayer services and information technology. Congress should not, Collins said, \u201cinadvertently throw out the baby with the bathwater.\u201d"

    "summary": "New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago",
    "story": [
      "New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago",
      "BOSTON -- The cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher, right?",
      "Not necessarily. New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago. And tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after years of hefty rises.",
      "Figures compiled by the nonprofit College Board indicate the average student attending an in-state public university this year faces a tuition bill of $11,610, which is down 4% from a decade earlier when taking inflation into account. But the real savings come in what the average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid. That's down 40% over the decade, from $4,140 to $2,480 annually, according to the data.",
      "That reduced cost means less borrowing. Just under half of students attending in-state public universities are graduating with some debt, down from 59% a decade earlier, according to the College Board figures. And among those who do borrow, the average loan balance has fallen by 17%, to $27,100.",
      "Meanwhile, at private colleges, tuition continues to rise, but at a much slower rate. It has increased 4% over the past decade, when taking inflation into account, to an average $43,350, according to the College Board. That's a big change from the two decades prior, when tuition increased 68%.",
      "Costs are coming down as Americans question whether college is worth the price. Surveys find that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value of a degree, and the percentage of high school graduates heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Yet research still finds that, over time, a degree pays off. Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn a median of $2.8 million during their careers, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma, according to research from Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions, said Jennifer Ma, an executive research scientist at the College Board and lead author of the study.",
      "\u201cWe know that during COVID, a lot of institutions \u2014 public and private \u2014 froze tuition,\u201d Ma said.",
      "As states and the federal government responded to the pandemic, Ma said, they increased higher education funding, allowing colleges to reduce the cost of attendance. Some of that money has since expired, however, including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly used up by the end of 2022.",
      "Cost was a major consideration in Kai Mattinson's decision to attend Northern Arizona University. It would have cost her about $39,000 annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships bring that down to between $15,000 and $20,000 for the 22-year-old senior from Nevada.",
      "\u201cI originally wanted to go to the University of Arizona, but when it came down to tuition and other cost, Northern Arizona University was the best option,\u201d said Mattinson, a physical education major who also works as a long-term substitute at a local elementary school.",
      "Many institutions have tried to limit cost increases. Purdue University in Indiana, for example, has frozen its annual in-state tuition at $9,992 for the past 13 years.",
      "Mark Becker, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said he was pleased to see the new data.",
      "\u201cInstitutional efforts to control costs, combined with many states\u2019 efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal investment in the Pell Grant, have increased college affordability and enabled significant progress on tackling student debt,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "Costs for those attending public two-year community colleges have fallen even more, by 9% over the past decade, according to the College Board data, which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "Still, for parents paying for their children to attend out-of-state public universities or private colleges, the costs remain daunting \u2014 as much as $95,000 annually, in some cases. However, many institutions offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle- and lower-income students.",
      "Some private colleges have been expanding their financial aid, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in November announced undergraduates with a family income below $200,000 would no longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall.",
      "Other private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in an increasingly difficult environment. They face a dwindling pool of young adults, and students who are more wary of signing up for giant loans. Recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational costs rise. After temporary relief thanks to federal money during the pandemic, many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs under control.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A top policymaker at the U.S. Federal Reserve said Wednesday that he still supports cutting interest rates this year, despite elevated inflation and the prospect of widespread tariffs under the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's board of governors, said he expects inflation will move closer to the Fed's 2% target in the coming months. And in some of the first comments by a Fed official specifically about tariffs, he said that greater import duties likely won't push up inflation this year.",
      "\u201cMy bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate,\u201d Waller said in Paris at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "\u201cIf, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view,\u201d Waller added.",
      "His remarks are noteworthy because the impact of tariffs is a key wild card for the economy this year. Waller also suggested he is more optimistic about inflation than many Wall Street investors, who increasingly expect the Fed to keep its rate steady this year as elevated prices continue to linger.",
      "\u201cI believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2% goal over the medium term and that further (rate) reductions will be appropriate,\u201d Waller said. While inflation has been persistent in recent months \u2014 it ticked up to 2.4% in November, according to the Fed's preferred measure \u2014 Waller argued that outside of housing, which is difficult to measure, prices are cooling.",
      "Waller\u2019s remarks run counter to increasing expectations on Wall Street that the Fed may not cut its key rate much, if at all, this year. It is currently about 4.3% after several reductions last year from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Financial markets are expecting just one rate reduction in 2025, according to futures pricing tracked by CME Fedwatch.",
      "Waller did not say how many cuts he specifically supports. Instead he said that Fed officials projected two reductions this year, as a group, in December. But he also noted that policymakers supported a wide range of outcomes, from no cuts to as many as five. The number of reductions will depend on progress towards reducing inflation, he added."

    "story": [
      "This week\u2019s winter wallop across the U.S. means different things to farmers in different places",
      "A nasty dose of winter weather has pummeled much of the U.S. from Kansas to the East Coast, leaving many Americans to dig out of the blizzard \u2014 including farmers And more is on the way, with the polar air expected to continue to grip some places until at least Friday.",
      "Farmers always watch the weather, but depending on where they're located and what they produce, winter always presents mental challenges for growers, said Carolyn Olson, an organic farmer in southwestern Minnesota who is also vice president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors.",
      "Producers know that the timing and amount of winter moisture affect farming conditions for the rest of the year. It's also a time for planning ahead \u2014 something becoming increasingly difficult as climate change ramps up variability in snowfall, rainfall and other weather conditions that can make or break an operation.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing that stressful part of making those decisions on how they\u2019re going to farm this year, what they\u2019re going to grow,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of pressure on agriculture at this time of the year.\"",
      "Biting wind and big drifts from almost a whole year's average snowfall in a single storm are hitting farmers in some parts of Kansas \u201cin ways that we haven\u2019t seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,\u201d said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University who developed an animal comfort tool. It includes an index of heat and cold that a farmer can use \u2014 along with their knowledge of their animals' age, coat, overall health and so forth \u2014 to watch for situations when they may need to get animals out of dangerous areas.",
      "The risk is real: Calves, especially, can die when temperatures slip below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water, Redmond said.",
      "That means preparing by moving animals and having a plan to care for them ahead of time is key \u2014 which is harder due to the unpredictability of climate change. And not having the right experience or infrastructure to prepare is \u201creally, really stressful on producers,\u201d Redmond said.",
      "The storm missed some states further north like Iowa and Minnesota that are generally more accustomed to snow. Stu Swanson, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said that eases tasks like moving grain and working with livestock.",
      "He added that without snow cover, the ground is more likely to freeze and thaw in a way that could benefit soils. Two years of drought followed by torrential rains last spring created tire ruts and compaction from farm machinery in some places, he said. He hopes that without as much snow, the freeze-thaw cycle will loosen up the soil and farmers may get the added bonus of some pests dying off before the spring.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any growing crop now, so really temperature doesn\u2019t matter. We look forward to a good freeze,\u201d Swanson said.",
      "The lack of snow is a greater concern farther north in some parts of Minnesota, where producers do have winter crops like alfalfa or winter wheat.",
      "Reliable snow cover is important in those areas because it insulates soil from cold. A few of inches of snow on top of a field can keep winter wheat\u2019s crown (which is still underground this time of year to withstand the winter) at 28 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius) even if the air temperature is as low as minus 40 Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius), said Jochum Wiersma, an extension professor at the University of Minnesota.",

      "All-wheel drive might not be a must-have, but it sure is nice to have if you live in any of the large swaths of America that regularly see snow. Certainly a good set of winter tires will get the job done much of the time, but if you want ultimate peace of mind, there\u2019s no substitute for all-wheel drive. Combine the two and you\u2019re virtually unstoppable.",
      "All-wheel drive was once rare in cars, but over the last 20 years it\u2019s become a much more common feature. Especially in the last 10 years, carmakers have added all-wheel drive to existing models as well as producing new all-wheel-drive models, helping to make this feature as affordable as it is ubiquitous.",
      "Edmunds\u2019 editors recognize lots of people want the confidence of all-wheel drive without buying a bulky SUV. Accordingly, they\u2019ve compiled this list of all-wheel-drive cars that can be found on the used market for less than $25,000.",
      "BMW\u2019s 3 Series sedans and 4 Series coupes are sport-luxury cars recognized for their engaging handling. With the exception of one generation of cars, the 3 Series has offered all-wheel drive in the U.S. since the mid-1980s when it debuted in the 325ix. And 4 Series coupes, introduced for the 2014 model year, have offered all-wheel drive since their inception. The most common 3 Series and 4 Series models on the used market today are contemporary trims fitted with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making in the mid-200-horsepower range.",
      "Look for: If you want more power, you can find BMW\u2019s 3.0-liter six-cylinder good for as much as 320 horsepower in upper trims. But you\u2019ll be trading power for condition or higher miles in this price range.",
      "2013-2022 3 Series and 4 Series approximate pricing: $10,000-$25,000",
      "Even eight years after its debut Tesla\u2019s Model 3 feels like the future inside. With a flat dash adorned only by a large central screen, the Tesla gestalt is in full effect in this compact electric sedan. Sure, it takes some adjustment for the Model 3\u2019s unconventional controls to become second nature, but they hardly diminish the experience. All-wheel-drive trims have been available since the 2018 model year.",
      "Look for: The fine print. Besides the tiny badge, there\u2019s no easy way to distinguish the all-wheel-drive versions from the rear-wheel-drive versions. The Long Range trim reduces range anxiety and still fits our budget.",

      "One of the earliest all-wheel-drive Japanese sedans, the Impreza made a name for itself through a rich motorsport legacy even if most Imprezas were workaday models. Imprezas from the last decade are available in both sedan and hatchback body styles with either a 2.0-liter or a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, both of which made modest power. But every Impreza sold in the U.S. since 1997 is all-wheel-drive. There\u2019s nothing luxurious about the Impreza, but its combination of all-wheel drive and priced-right utility makes it great for winter driving.",
      "Look for: Low-mileage Imprezas. Cars with 10,000 miles or less can be found well inside our price cap.",
      "2012-2024 Impreza approximate pricing: $5,000-$25,000",
      "Mazda began to offer all-wheel drive in its compact Mazda 3 in 2019. Sedan and five-door hatchback body styles are available as are two engines, both 2.5-liter four-cylinders. The upgrade engine is turbocharged and produces 250 horsepower (starting in 2021), but the base engine is fine. The Mazda 3 is an overachiever inside with premium materials that verge into luxury territory. It\u2019s also one of the most fun-to-drive cars in its class and its stunning good looks are hard to ignore. But it\u2019s smaller inside than many competitors.",

Starting in the 2019 model year, when it was last redesigned, Nissan added all-wheel drive to the Altima. The drivetrain pairs only with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, but it\u2019s very efficient, exceeding the EPA estimate of 30 mpg combined by 4 mpg in Edmunds\u2019 testing.",

    "summary": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and other Republicans will push to limit lawsuits when the legislative session starts this month",
    "story": [
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and other Republicans will push to limit lawsuits when the legislative session starts this month",
      "ATLANTA -- After years of stalled efforts to limit civil lawsuits, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Republican lawmakers are doubling down with a new push.",
      "Supporters, most prominently business groups, call the state a \u201cjudicial hellhole,\u201d and argue that businesses are being crushed by rising insurance costs driven by excessive lawsuits that have helped plaintiffs get big payouts.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not about business,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s about every Georgian paying more and more premiums for their insurance. Whatever we can do to make it more affordable to own a home, operate your vehicle and protect your family with insurance, we need to do it.\u201d",
      "But opponents say there's no proof that lawsuits are closely linked to rising insurance rates and that limits will make it harder for injured parties to win justice in court.",
      "\u201cThis is about trying to do some favors for people who hopefully will line your political pockets,\u201d said Jen Jordan, an attorney and former Democratic state senator. \u201cAt the end of the day, Georgians are going to be hurt.\u201d",
      "Kemp in 2022 promised the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, one of his top allies, that he would seek to limit lawsuit costs, a push that many call \u201ctort reform.\u201d But he admitted in 2023 that the effort was complicated, and instead signed a law to gather data on lawsuit verdicts.",
      "Even as Kemp held events to build public support ahead of the legislative session, which begins Monday, the Republican governor is having to contend with GOP lawyers in the General Assembly who make a living by filing lawsuits, Democrats who mostly oppose changes, and a state Supreme Court that has voided earlier limits.",
      "One key issue is lawsuits against stores, apartment complexes and other businesses over crimes or injuries on their property. In one such lawsuit, Georgia mother Sheila Brooks sued Family Dollar and Dollar Tree last year after her son Lem Johnny Johnson IV was fatally shot at one of their south Atlanta stores.",
      "Police say the shooter wasn't a Family Dollar employee, but the lawsuit alleges that Family Dollar knew about earlier incidents \u201cinvolving gunshots, gunplay, assault, violent threats with weapons, and disturbing acts of violence\" at and near the location. The store should have taken more security measures to protect their customers, the complaint said.",
      "Supporters of lawsuit limits say property owners shouldn't be held responsible for the wrongdoing of customers and trespassers.",
      "\u201cIf we fix this problem, Georgia could be a much easier, well-perceived place for businesses and their insurers,\u201d said attorney Bill Custer. \u201cIt will fix our reputation as a bad-boy state.\u201d",
      "Nancy Palmer, a spokesperson for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, said Georgia\u2019s legal landscape has driven insurance companies out, making it difficult for businesses to get adequate coverage. She said insurance costs have become \u201cuntenable\u201d across industries, affecting day care centers, grocery store owners, pharmacies, low-income housing providers and others in urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Darion Dunn, a managing partner at Atlantic Strategies, which develops affordable housing and is behind a micro community for previously unsheltered people known as \u201cThe Melody,\u201d said insurance companies are raising premiums or denying coverage in areas they label as \u201chigh crime\" due to concerns about litigation.",
      "\u201cBecause of these rising insurance costs, we\u2019ve had to walk away from projects that would otherwise have brought much-needed affordable housing,\" Dunn said.",
      "Dunn wants to see lawmakers limit the amount of compensation people can seek for non-economic damages such as emotional pain and suffering. Georgia\u2019s legislature capped such verdicts in 2005, but the state Supreme Court overturned the law in 2010 as unconstitutional.",
      "The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association disputes the idea that insurance costs are rising because of jury verdicts, and said in a statement that \u201cinsurance companies have continued to raise premiums despite making record profits.\u201d",
      "To limit a property owner's liability, lawmakers could limit the kind of evidence lawyers can use to prove property owners knew about the risk of incidents like Johnson's killing.",
      "Lawmakers could also instruct juries to assign a minimum amount of blame to the person who committed the crime. In an oft-cited 2023 case, a man was awarded almost $43 million in a lawsuit against CVS after he was shot in a CVS parking lot during an armed robbery. The jury found CVS 95% responsible for the shooting, the victim 5% responsible and assigned no responsibility to the shooter.",
      "These kinds of large verdicts are rare, said Madeline Summerville, an Atlanta attorney and political consultant for Democrats. She said large verdicts often result when insurers refuse to settle cases they should, and while some cases are \u201cfrivolous,\u201d most aren't.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t make legislation based on the fact that there\u2019s a minority of folks that are trying to game the system and then convince all of the people of Georgia that that\u2019s the majority of the cases that are coming through,\" Summerville said.",
      "Summerville is particularly worried about changes to medical malpractice lawsuits, where people sue medical providers for botched work. If medical practitioners aren't held accountable, the level of care will decline, she said.",
      "In a roundtable hosted by Kemp last fall, medical executives said insurance costs are rising and doctors fear working in Georgia because they might get sued. Van Loskoski, CEO of Stephens County Hospital in Toccoa, said the hospital couldn't recruit obstetricians because of the fear of lawsuits and stopped delivering babies in 2021. The hospital\u2019s medical malpractice premiums then fell by 13%, Loskoski said.",
      "Lawmakers also could consider other measures, including some similar to laws passed in Florida in 2023. For example, they could require attorneys to show jurors how much plaintiffs actually paid in medical bills, as opposed to \u201cphantom damages\u201d based on the amounts they were originally charged. Legislators could also order separate trials to determine who is at fault for medical damages and what those damages are.",

      "The Fed began cutting its main interest rate in September  to give the economy a boost, but it\u2019s hinted a slowdown in easing  is coming.

So have worries about other possible Trump policies, such as tax cuts, which could swell the U.S. government\u2019s debt and likewise push yields higher.",
      "Those higher yields make Treasury bonds more attractive to investors who might otherwise buy stocks, which in turn puts downward pressure on stock prices, and the super-safe bonds are paying notably more. The yield on a 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.69% from 4.63% shortly before the release of Tuesday\u2019s reports and from just 4.15% in early December.",

      "The lawsuit arrives as U.S. renters continue to struggle under a merciless housing market, with incomes failing to keep up with rent increases. The latest figures show that half of American renters spent more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities in 2022, an all-time high.",
      "That means exhausting, day-to-day decisions between medications, groceries, school supplies and rent. It means eviction notices and protracted court cases in which children face the highest eviction rates, with 1.5 million evicted each year, according to Princeton University's Eviction Lab.",

      "The department, along with 10 states including North Carolina, Tennessee, Colorado and California, is accusing six landlords that collectively operate more than 1.3 million units in 43 states and the District of Columbia of scheming to avoid lowering rents.",
      "The landlord Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC, a defendant in the case, declined a request for comment from The Associated Press, but published an unsigned statement on its website.",
      "\u201cGreystar has and will conduct its business with the utmost integrity. At no time did Greystar engage in any anti-competitive practices,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves in this lawsuit.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit accuses the landlords of sharing sensitive data on rents and occupancy with competing firms via email, phone calls or in groups.

      "Ohio State and Texas are both seeking a chance to end national title droughts",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- There is still a sense for some Ohio State players that they haven't done anything yet, even after winning twice already this postseason to get into the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Texas.",
      "\"Absolutely. I have been here for four years, and I have absolutely no hardware to show for it,\" receiver Emeka Egbuka said. \u201cThat\u2019s really on the forefront of our minds.\u201d",
      "While Ohio State is the only school to appear in four of the last six CFPs, all since Ryan Day became head coach, and won four consecutive Big Ten titles from 2017-20 before Egbuka and most of the current players arrived, the Buckeyes' last national championship was 10 years ago. That was the first season of the four-team College Football Playoff, when they won the title at AT&T Stadium, the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys where they play the in-state Longhorns (13-2).",
      "The winner Friday night advances to the national title game in Atlanta on Jan. 20.",
      "Ohio State (12-2) is the No. 8 seed now favored to win the national title after two lopsided playoff wins: 42-17 at home against Tennessee before a dominating 41-21 win over undefeated Big Ten champion and top seed Oregon in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just fighting to get another opportunity to play with each other,\u201d said linebacker and captain Cody Simon, one of nine Ohio State players still around from 2020. \u201cThat's our biggest motivator right now. ... We don't want to end this run right now.\"",
      "Texas last won the national title 19 years ago, and didn't make its CFP debut until last season as the Big 12 champion. Coach Steve Sarkisian's Longhorns are now the last team standing for the SEC, the only league to be represented in the semifinals each year \u2014 and has six of the last nine national champions.",
      "The 15 games for the Longhorns, who played in the SEC championship game before wins over Clemson and Big 12 champ Arizona State, are already one more than they had ever played in a single season.",
      "\"I like the new playoff dynamic. It\u2019s fun,\u201d Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obsessed with finishing up,\u201d said Longhorns All-America senior cornerback Jahdae Barron. \u201cBut we\u2019re obsessed with being enamored with us, and giving every day the respect that it deserves. And just being loving to one another and having a level bond with one another and continuing to build the culture.\u201d",
      "Ohio State quarterback Will Howard and Ewers both won Big 12 championships the last time they played at AT&T Stadium.",
      "Texas was the Big 12 champ last season. Howard transferred to Ohio State from Kansas State, which two years ago beat CFP-bound and undefeated TCU in overtime for that league title.",
      "Howard started three games against Texas while with the Wildcats. Those were all losses, as was a fourth game when he was on the sideline.",
      "The best matchup of the game could be Barron vs Buckeyes freshman receiver Jeremiah Smith. The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Barron won the Thorpe Award as the nation\u2019s top defensive back. But Barron gives up four inches and 15 pounds to Smith, the second-team All-American who may be the most electric freshman in the country. Smith has 70 receptions for 1,224 yards and 14 touchdowns. Smith has four touchdowns in these playoffs.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big baller. Strong,\u201d Barron said. \u201cHe\u2019s a physical player, and I\u2019ll have to be physical.\u201d",
      "In its two losses to Georgia this season, Texas struggled to protect Ewers and surrendered 13 sacks. Now the Longhorns face a Buckeyes defensive front that sacked Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel eight times in the Rose Bowl. Jack Sawyer and J.T. Tuimoloau each had two sacks in that game. Sawyer was Ewers\u2019 roommate when the Longhorns QB spent a semester in Columbus before transferring to Texas.",
      "Texas is playing in its 23rd Cotton Bowl, the most for any team. But this is the Longhorns' first in 22 years. Ohio State is in its second Cotton Bowl in a row, and fourth overall, after losing 14-3 to Missouri last season.",
      "While the winner plays for the national title, the loser goes into an offseason that will lead up to a rematch when the two teams meet in a 2025 season opener at Ohio State on Aug. 30.",
      "Their only previous regular-season meetings were a home-and-home series in 2005 and 2006. The road team won both of those games and went on to play for the national championship \u2014 Vince Young and the Longhorns beat Southern Cal for the 2005 national title. Ohio State lost to Florida the following season.",

      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Even though he was wearing a sling on his left arm, Trevor Lawrence was able to point plenty of fingers on Thursday \u2014 most of them at himself.",
      "The Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback spoke publicly for the first time since having season-ending shoulder surgery that came after he had recovered from a violent, concussion-inducing hit. His availability came three days after team owner Shad Khan fired coach Doug Pederson and kept oft-criticized general manager Trent Baalke.",
      "Lawrence agreed with Khan\u2019s assessment that the offense was too predictable and made it clear that the Jaguars (4-13) need more toughness and a better culture under their next head coach.",
      "\u201cWe need to get some juice back in this place,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve lost that in the past year and a half or so, for whatever reason. We got to get that back. And I think that\u2019s something that us as leaders on the team really have to look at.",
      "\u201cWe have to take our part, too. This isn\u2019t just we fired Coach Peterson, so that\u2019s all on him. That\u2019s on us as players, too. We have to get that energy back. \u2026 We have to be the ones to really change our trajectory, to be honest.\u201d",
      "The Jaguars have requested interviews with 10 potential replacements, a list that includes five current NFL coordinators and three former head coaches. Jacksonville released an eight-man list Tuesday but have since added Minnesota defensive coordinator Brian Flores and Kansas City defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.",
      "Joe Brady (Buffalo), Liam Coen (Tampa Bay), Aaron Glenn (Detroit), Patrick Graham (Las Vegas), Ben Johnson (Detroit), Todd Monken (Baltimore), Kellen Moore (Kellen Moore) and Robert Saleh (Green Bay) also are on the list.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we are doing all the right things as far as talking to all the right people and all the big-name candidates that are out there,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cI don\u2019t know any of those people personally, really. So \u2026 I don\u2019t necessarily have an opinion.\u201d",
      "Lawrence does have a preference, though.",
      "\u201cObviously I\u2019m biased. I\u2019m an offensive guy. I\u2019m a quarterback,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cFrom that standpoint, sounds great having a young offensive coach that can bring the system in and that we can just grow together and have that system in place for years to come.\u201d",
      "The part that would help the most: Lawrence staying healthy.",
      "Lawrence was carted off the field in early December after Houston's Azeez Al-Shaair delivered a forearm to his facemask, a late hit that caused two sideline-clearing brawls.",
      "The unsportsmanlike blow left Lawrence in the fencing position \u2014 a common response to a traumatic brain injury in which both fists clench \u2014 and he stayed on the ground for several minutes while a melee ensued nearby.",
      "Lawrence said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the hit was right,\u201d and added that Al-Shaair has yet to reach out.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think personally attacking the guy is the right answer,\u201d Lawrence said.",
      "It was the latest injury for Lawrence, who missed a game in 2023 because of a sprained right shoulder. He also missed significant practice time that season because of a sprained left knee, a sprained right ankle and a concussion two weeks later.",
      "He now has missed eight games over two years and surely will be labeled as injury-prone moving forward.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d said Lawrence, who threw for 2,045 yards in 10 games this season, with 11 touchdown passes and seven interceptions. \u201cI just want to stay healthy. What bothers me is not being out there, so I\u2019m not really worried about any labels or tags or anything.",
      "\u201cI just want to be out there. I feel like I know I can impact the game and help us win games when I\u2019m out there. And when I\u2019m not, it\u2019s tough.\u201d",
      "Lawrence will be in the sling for three more weeks and expects to be back on the field for organized team activities in May. In the meantime, he will wait for Khan and Baalke to land Lawrence his third head coach in five years.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s an offensive coach or a defensive coach, just a guy that\u2019s going to instill that culture, that toughness into our team and that confidence that it doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re playing, when we\u2019re playing, just spot the ball and we can beat anybody,\" Lawrence said. \"Just a tough team that other teams don\u2019t want to play against.\u201d",

      "Johnny Gaudreau's jersey number will be retired by his junior team at a ceremony this weekend honoring him and his late brother, Matthew.",
      "The Dubuque Fighting Saints of the United States Hockey League will raise Gaudreau\u2019s No. 8 to the rafters on Saturday with the brothers\u2019 parents, Guy and Jane, sisters Katie and Kristen, and Johnny\u2019s widow, Meredith, scheduled to be in attendance at the arena in eastern Iowa.",
      "\u201cIt was an honor befitting of his contribution to the organization and also obviously the sad circumstances that happened,\u201d Fighting Saints part owner Peter Luukko told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cHe was one of the better players in the history of the team.\u201d",
      "Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau died Aug. 29 when they were struck by an SUV while riding bicycles on a rural New Jersey road near their hometown of Carneys Point. The driver charged with killing them pleaded not guilty earlier this week after turning down a prosecution offer of 35 years in prison.",
      "Gaudreau's No. 8 \u2014 not the No. 13 he is better known for wearing while playing at Boston College, in the NHL with the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets and internationally while representing the U.S. \u2014 will be the first retired in franchise history. Gaudreau was Dubuque's leading scorer the season he played there (2010-11) and led it to winning the Clark Cup as USHL champions.",
      "\u201cWhen we were assembling the team that first year, we looked for players with a high hockey IQ and compete level who came from good families,\u201d said Jim Montgomery, who coached three seasons in Dubuque before moving on to the University of Denver and the NHL's Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins and now the St. Louis Blues. \u201cJohnny was the epitome of those qualities. He was a uniquely gifted player who came from an equally special family. It\u2019s only fitting that the Fighting Saints retire his number as no other player could be his equal.\u201d",
      "Managing partner Brad Kwong said in a statement that he hopes Gaudreau's number hanging in the rafters \"will be an inspiration to every young hockey player who plays in this arena and particularly to those players who suit up for the Fighting Saints. His enthusiastic spirit and love for the game will forever be present.\u201d",
      "Also expected at the ceremony is USHL Commissioner Glenn Hefferan, who will announce the Gaudreau Award to be given to a player who embodies Johnny and Matthew's qualities of excellence in hockey, spirit of the game, and care and responsibility. The Fighting Saints will donate proceeds from their 50/50 drawing during their game against the Sioux City Musketeers to the John and Matthew Gaudreau Foundation, which will fund an adaptive playground at a school for kids with disabilities in South Jersey.",
      "\"We have to remember each other, support each other,\" said Luukko, a former NHL executive whose sons Nick and Max played hockey growing up in the Philadelphia area at the same time as Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community, and you don\u2019t want to ever forget those who came before you, whether it\u2019s a veteran player or for something as tragic as the accident with the Gaudreau brothers.\u201d",
      "Johnny Gaudreau in 2018 became a minority owner in the club as part of Saints4Life Acquisitions LLC, a group including Luukko, NHL player Zemgus Girgensons and Stanley Cup-winning coach Dan Bylsma.",

      "Frank Wycheck, the NFL tight end best known for throwing the lateral that started the \u201cMusic City Miracle\u201d and launched the Tennessee Titans\u2019 run to the franchise\u2019s lone Super Bowl appearance, had stage III chronic traumatic encelphalopathy when he die...",
      "Frank Wycheck, the NFL tight end best known for throwing the lateral that started the \u201cMusic City Miracle\u201d and launched the Tennessee Titans\u2019 run to the franchise\u2019s lone Super Bowl appearance, had stage III chronic traumatic encelphalopathy when he died on Dec. 9, 2023, at his Chattanooga home, his family said Thursday.",
      "Wycheck died at the age of 52 after apparently hitting his head in a fall at home. He had made clear his wishes to work with experts for CTE research and on-going brain injury.",
      "Researchers at Boston University\u2019s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center confirmed Wycheck had CTE stage III, with stage IV the most severe form of the neurodegenerative disease that can lead to dementia, memory loss and depression. The three-time Pro Bowl tight end played in the NFL between 1993 and 2003, starting with Washington and finishing his career with the Houston Oilers organization, which moved to Tennessee and became the Titans.",
      "Wycheck\u2019s family said in a statement they are grateful for this diagnosis, which they believe further highlights the concerns around CTE in contact sports like football. They want to honor his legacy with a stronger commitment to player safety and support for those affected by head injuries. His daughters said their family had challenges understanding both the physical and mental changes Wycheck was experiencing, thinking he was just missing the spotlight of his career.",
      "\u201cWe witnessed our father becoming increasingly isolated and experiencing drastic mood swings. He became more impulsive, and often inconsistent and undependable,\u201d Deanna Wycheck Szabo said in a statement. \u201cNow in hindsight, I understand that he was suffering from the symptoms of CTE due to the repeated trauma his brain and body endured over 11 seasons in the NFL.\u201d",
      "Szabo said Wycheck loved football and his teammates. She said he fought for years after retiring to bring attention to the symptoms and struggles he knew stemmed from CTE, feeling too often ignored and helpless. Szabo said she wishes her family had been educated on CTE symptoms to know what to look for and now hope for increased intervention, education and support for NFL alumni and their families.",
      "\u201cInstead of believing that something was inherently wrong with him, we now know he was doing the best he could as a father and friend under circumstances beyond his control,\u201d Szabo said.",
      "Madison Wycheck Nowell said she worried daily about her father when he retired, whether he was eating, drinking enough water or making his appointments. She said they saw his health rapidly decline and hope this is a cautionary tale.",
      "\u201cMy dad explained that it felt like his brain had a thick brick wall inside that stopped his will to follow through with anything, no matter what it was or who was involved,\u201d Nowell said in her statement. \u201cRegardless of his CTE symptoms, I will always believe that God intervened to allow him the opportunity to enjoy our weddings, his grandkids, and all other things he truly wanted to be a part of before he left us.\u201d",
      "Wednesday was the 25th anniversary of the Music City Miracle, a lateral from Wycheck to Kevin Dyson that led to a touchdown on the kickoff return and rallied the Titans over Buffalo in an AFC wild-card game.",
      "That TD return ranked fourth among the NFL\u2019s greatest plays over the league\u2019s first 100 years.",

      "Woodland knows all about anxiety and the value of being open.",
      "He lived in fear of dying for nearly four months in 2023 until doctors discovered a lesion on his brain, on a tract that caused unfounded fears. They cut a hole the size of a baseball in his head to remove as much of the tumor as they could. He is making progress as he starts a new year.",
      "Woodland was among dozens of players, caddies and tour officials who stood along the shores east of Waikiki to celebrate Murray in a solemn ceremony Tuesday morning. It reminded him of a moment with Murray that taught him the impact players can have without even knowing it.",
      "They played together in the final round of the PGA Championship, just six days before Murray died. Woodland said a man in the gallery was following them and yelling at Murray to get his attention. For the longest time, they ignored him.",
      "\u201cFinally, Grayson looked over and the guy broke down and started crying and thanked Grayson for how open he was about his struggles and everything. The guy was sober now. He was getting into golf because of Grayson. He heard Grayson\u2019s story,\u201d Woodland said.",
      "\u201cI thought maybe Grayson made him mad. He was yelling \u2014 \u2018Grayson, Grayson\u2019 \u2014 time after time. We were laughing about it talking, and then Grayson looked, and it was beautiful.\u201d",

I have an opportunity to leave this world a better place than I found it, and I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to give back to people that are struggling. Because if you\u2019re ever feeling alone in that moment, it sucks. And it\u2019s hard.\u201d",

      "Anything to get the ball into Mims' hands more, so he can show off those fast feet.",
      "The speedy returner/receiver/runner has become a dynamic, multifaceted threat for the playoff-bound Broncos \u2014 a game-changer on special teams and as part of the Bo Nix-led offense.",
      "\u201cIt puts a lot of stress on (the defense),\u201d offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said of Mims\u2019 versatility as the Broncos (10-7) prepare for their AFC wild-card round game Sunday at Buffalo (13-4). \u201cHe\u2019s a talented player, and you have to get creative sometimes to get him the ball. It\u2019s been working out well.\u201d",
      "The second-year player out of Oklahoma recently was named to the Pro Bowl squad as a return specialist for the second straight season. That's elite territory, with the only other player in Broncos history to be named to the Pro Bowl in each of his first two seasons being Von Miller, the talented pass rusher who\u2019s now tormenting quarterbacks for the Bills.",
      "\u201cAny time I can be recognized in the same stat as him, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mims said.",
      "The Broncos view Mims as their version of Cordarrelle Patterson, the longtime do-everything player now with the Pittsburgh Steelers. A facsimile, too, of San Francisco 49ers wideout Deebo Samuel.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been great to see the growth that you hope you see in a player in his second year,\u201d coach Sean Payton said of Mims. \u201cWe saw it right away as a returner a year ago, and we saw spurts. So it always just takes me back to, \u2018Are we doing things? Can we find a role?\u2019\u201d",
      "They've been patient not to heap too much on Mims too fast. Although, he's ready for any wrinkle in the playbook.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s just memorization for the most part,\u201d Mims said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just being a playmaker and making plays (in) a certain situation. It\u2019s never just picture perfect. At the end of the day, you just have to take what\u2019s there.\u201d",
      "As a receiver this season, Mims has 39 catches for 503 yards and six touchdowns. That includes two each in the last two games of the season, one of them a spectacular grab between two defenders on fourth down that sent Denver's game at Cincinnati into overtime two weeks ago.",
      "In the backfield, he\u2019s carried the ball 13 times for 42 yards.",
      "But his real specialty remains punt returns, where he had a league-leading 15.7-yard average, marking the first time a Broncos player has led the NFL in that category since Rick Upchurch averaged 16.1 yards in 1982.",
      "\u201cI love being a punt returner. I feel like there are so many plays to be made at punt return,\u201d said Mims, who's also returned seven kicks for a 27.7-yard average. \u201cThat\u2019s probably my favorite thing that I get to do.\u201d",
      "He nearly broke a punt return this season against Indianapolis, cutting across the field and sprinting along the sideline for 61 yards in the fourth quarter of a game the Broncos trailed. It set up a go-ahead touchdown in a must-win game that propelled Denver toward its first playoff berth in nine seasons.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been such an asset for us,\u201d special teams coordinator Ben Kotwica said. \u201cThe punt return element, he\u2019s been exceptional again this year.\u201d",
      "Mims knows the uplifting power that a punt return has on the team because receiver Courtland Sutton reminds him all the time.",
      "\u201cEven if it\u2019s 10 yards, it\u2019s such a big momentum change for us,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cJust to see him running with the ball \u2014 he\u2019s an exciting guy with the ball in his hands \u2014 and watching him go down the sidelines a couple times, it\u2019s exciting because at any moment you know that he could take it to the crib.\u201d",
      "Mims' big receiving games this season include not only an eight-catch, two-touchdown performance at Cincinnati, but a 93-yard TD reception from Nix in a win over Cleveland.",
      "\u201cIt was one of those awesome plays that you don\u2019t get often,\u201d Nix said. \u201cBut they\u2019re pretty fun.\u201d",

      "It was some combination of religion, a grudge involving Knute Rockne and a rival, and maybe the simple time-honored notion that some people just don\u2019t like Notre Dame",
      "DANIA BEACH, Fla. -- It was some combination of religion, a grudge involving Knute Rockne and maybe the simple notion that some people just don't like Notre Dame.",
      "Back in the 1920s, the Fighting Irish made what might have been their biggest push to join what would become the Big Ten but the athletic director at Michigan blocked it. Ever since, Notre Dame has been an independent \u2014 an increasingly rare iconoclast as college athletics becomes more controlled by mega-conferences almost by the day.",
      "How's that working out for the Irish?",
      "Well, instead of splitting the $14 million they've earned by reaching the semifinals of the College Football Playoff \u2014 the way Thursday's opponent Penn State of the Big Ten must \u2014 they've pocketed every penny.",
      "Notre Dame might not have the voice of the Southeastern Conference or Big Ten when it comes to the big-time decisions guiding this sport, but it has a seat at the table, along with another $12 million starting in 2026 \u2014 also unsplit with a league \u2014 simply for being part of this arrangement.",
      "\u201cFor people at Notre Dame, it's a point of differentiation,\u201d said John Heisler, the longtime sports information guru who has written 10 books on the Irish. \u201cAnd it's just not something that anybody in South Bend really wants to give up on.\u201d",
      "It wasn't always that way. As far back as 1899, Notre Dame was looking to be admitted into what was about to become the Big Nine. That time, it essentially got passed over in favor of Iowa and Indiana.",
      "A generation later, in 1926, Rockne, then coaching the Fighting Irish, tried again to bring Notre Dame into the Big Ten.",
      "Michigan's athletic director, Fielding Yost, led the move to block the Irish \u2014 a move that, depending on what you read, came because he was anti-Catholic or involved in a feud with the Notre Dame legend that dated back more than a decade.",
      "Either way, Notre Dame was left out and the Fighting Irish and Michigan, just a three-hour drive apart, didn't play from 1910-1941.",
      "Michigan and other schools' refusal to play the team in South Bend, Indiana, opened opportunities Notre Dame still takes advantage of to this day.",
      "The Fighting Irish have played USC every year since 1926. They have annual meetings with Army and Navy, and have played Stanford most years since 1988. More recently, they signed a deal that fills out their schedule with five games against Atlantic Coast Conference teams each season.",
      "In today's world, where cable, streaming and social media allow for every team to market themselves as a national product, that might not sound revolutionary. Decades ago, it was.",
      "\u201cI think the feeling was, if Notre Dame would have just wanted to be a Midwest institution, they would've joined the Big Ten a long time ago,\u201d Heisler said. \u201cBut that's not just the aspiration in terms of where their students in general come from, or where they recruit. They've always been very comfortable recruiting from all over the place.\u201d",
      "For decades, Notre Dame lived in a world where the big-name independent was not an anomaly. Miami, Pitt, Florida State and Syracuse were among them, as was this week's opponent, Penn State.",
      "In that atmosphere, the Fighting Irish went along with others in the 1970s and joined the College Football Association, which was established to maximize value for TV rights.",
      "By 1990, with the CFA's effectiveness as a TV market-maker in decline and Notre Dame football reaching a new golden era under Lou Holtz, the Fighting Irish in 1991 cut their own deal with NBC that, in many ways, was the first domino to fall on the multibillion-dollar road this sport is on today.",
      "The SEC expanded to 12 teams in 1992 and added what was then a revolutionary title game to cap off its season. Over the next three-plus decades, virtually every program got caught up in the mix of mega-conferences that, in turn, have helped shape the 12-team college playoff that debuted this season.",
      "Holding steady throughout, in part thanks to the NBC deal that runs through the 2029 season, has been Notre Dame. Even though the Irish haven't won the national title since 1988, their brand stayed strong enough to demand a spot in that playoff mix.",
      "One drawback is that, without a conference championship available to win, the Fighting Irish could not find an easier path to the title by earning a bye that goes to those league's champions.",
      "Another is that because the big conferences have generated such massive media rights, Notre Dame needs every penny it can get to stay competitive. Its football program has one of the nation's biggest budgets, at about $72 million a year, according to Sportico.",
      "\u201cWe view being independent as a positive thing,\" coach Marcus Freeman said. \"We sell it to our recruits as a positive thing. We know we can't play in a championship game and we can't have a first-round bye. But we continue to use not playing in Week 13 as our bye. In terms of the finances and the TV deals, I'd say that's another positive.\u201d",
      "More change is destined for college football, its playoff system and the conferences themselves.",
      "At the joint pregame news conference Wednesday, Penn State coach James Franklin opined about the need for more uniformity across all of college football \u2014 for one, to give the playoff selection committee a more \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison when sorting through teams to fill the bracket.",
      "\u201cThis is no knock at coach or Notre Dame, but I think everyone should be in a conference,\" Franklin said, before almost apologetically looking at Freeman on the other end of the table.",
      "Freeman said he doesn't have opinions as strong as Franklin's on the state of college football, and doesn't see the need for Notre Dame to someday be like everybody else.",
      "\u201cWe pride ourselves and our independence,\u201d the Fighting Irish coach said. \u201cIf they come out with a decision where they tell us we can't be independent, we'll make it work.\u201d",

      "MIAMI -- Hockey. Outdoors. In Florida.",
      "Next season, the NHL is making it happen \u2014 twice.",
      "The NHL announced Wednesday that the Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers will play host to the New York Rangers at loanDepot Park in Miami \u2014 home of baseball\u2019s Marlins \u2014 on Jan. 2, 2026, in the Winter Classic, with the Tampa Bay Lightning playing host to the Boston Bruins at Raymond James Stadium on Feb. 1, 2026, in a Stadium Series game.",
      "\u201cStanley Cups, strings of sellouts and the exponential growth of youth and high school hockey throughout the state have demonstrated that Florida is a hockey hotbed,\u201d NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. \u201cOutdoor NHL games in the Sunshine State? Never let it be said that our league isn\u2019t willing to accept a challenge.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a long time coming, but the Panthers and Lightning have represented the Eastern Conference in each of the last five Stanley Cup Finals and they've built heavily engaged fan bases. And both franchises have asked the NHL to bring an outdoor game \u2014 or two, in this case \u2014 to the Sunshine State for many years.",
      "The league listened.",
      "\u201cTo be able to celebrate these two franchises against great Original Six teams, I think, is phenomenal,\u201d Panthers President Matthew Caldwell said. \u201cAnd I think our time has come. We deserve that outdoor game and we\u2019re fired up to have it right here locally.\u201d",
      "The Marlins\u2019 ballpark, located about a 45-minute drive south of the Panthers' home arena in Sunrise, can hold about 37,000 fans. Raymond James Stadium \u2014 home of the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers \u2014 can hold about 65,000 for most events, and capacity can be increased a bit if necessary.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited for this landmark event to finally arrive for Bolts Nation and the Tampa Bay community,\u201d Lightning CEO Steve Griggs said. \u201cThis moment has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re thrilled to see this dream become a reality.\u201d",
      "These will not be ordinary outdoor games.",
      "The high in Miami on Jan. 2 this year was 78. The high in Tampa last year on Feb. 1 was 66. Those temperatures aren't conducive to finding ice outside. And the high game-time temperature for any of the previous outdoor games in NHL history, the league said, was 65 for a game in Denver in 2016.",
      "\u201cWe understand it\u2019s risky,\" said Steve Mayer, the NHL's president of content and events. \"I think we like it. And it\u2019s not a challenge. It\u2019s actually an opportunity for us.\u201d",
      "The Marlins' loanDepot Park has a retractable roof and that will play a big role in getting that stadium ready for hockey. The air conditioning will be cranked up \u2014 way up \u2014 and the Panthers-Rangers game will be played at night with the roof open. For the Lightning-Bruins game inside the open-air stadium in Tampa, the NHL will build a temporary roof over the ice surface and remove it just a few hours before game time.",
      "\u201cWe want to bring a little bit of a winter wonderland to Florida,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "The games in 2026 will be the 44th and 45th regular-season outdoor contests in NHL history. The Rangers are 5-0-0 in their previous outdoor games, Boston has won four of its five outdoor games and the Lightning prevailed in their only outdoor contest. The Panthers have never played such a game.",
      "\u201cWe get to expand our great sport,\" Panthers general manager and hockey operations president Bill Zito said. \"We have a chance to have 100,000 people watching hockey live, outside, in Florida. That's unthinkable. And the exciting part and the fun part is it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s getting bigger. More and more people are becoming hockey fans in Florida.\"",

      "Actually, for tennis, 2025 began while the calendar still read 2024.",
      "\u201cI do, obviously, wish that the offseason was longer, 100%,\u201d said 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, who began her \u201cyear\u201d by helping the American team win the United Cup title in Sydney, more than a week after that competition began on Dec. 27. \u201cBut it is what it is.\u201d",
      "When the Australian Open gets going Sunday morning in Melbourne (Saturday night EST), players will have tuned up by playing in various events that followed a period of practice and work in the gym that was longer for some than others.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there is even an offseason anymore,\u201d 2021 Wimbledon semifinalist Denis Shapovalov said. \u201cThe season is never-ending.\u201d",

      "The golf season is similar, essentially running non-stop, without the multiple months off offered by team sports.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, we (have been) fighting to have a longer offseason. To be healthy \u2026 you at least need a two-month offseason. So it would be great to finish a little bit earlier,\u201d said Conchita Martinez, a former player who won the 1994 Wimbledon championship and is now the coach of Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva.",
      "\u201cFor the health of the tour, for the health of the players,\" Martinez said, \"maybe (the season) should be a little bit shorter.\u201d",
      "This is, to be sure, not a new concern.",
      "Yet nothing seems to have changed. If anything, the problem is becoming more pronounced.",
      "And to Martinez's point, the opening week of this season included two singles finals in which one player stopped playing \u2014 Naomi Osaka in Auckland, New Zealand, and Reilly Opelka in Brisbane, Australia \u2014 because of an injury concern (it's also likely they wanted to make sure not to push themselves too hard with the year's first Grand Slam tournament on the horizon).",
      "That's why, as much as possible, the athletes try to find some down time before getting ready to ramp up for what's to come.",
      "\u201cI had 1\u00bd weeks that I didn\u2019t touch the tennis racket. I just threw it in my room. I didn\u2019t want to see it again,\u201d four-time major champ Carlos Alcaraz joked. \u201cIt was really helpful to disconnect a little bit.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou take a bit of a break. But you need to get right back on the court and in the gym to get ready for Australia,\u201d said Jasmine Paolini, the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon in 2024. \u201cAs soon as you can, you need to practice, but there isn\u2019t a lot of time, so you have to figure out how to schedule things.\"",
      "Ben Shelton, a big server who was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and U.S. Open two years ago, spent time on his return game this offseason. He was representing the United States at the Davis Cup in Spain in late November, then playing an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden in early December, before heading to his new home, Orlando, Florida, to get ready for January.",
      "Unlike many players, he skipped any competition in the first week of 2025, instead opting to enter an event in Auckland this week before heading to Melbourne.",
      "The mind-set, Shelton explains, amounts to: \u201cOh, I\u2019m six weeks off; I\u2019m not really \u2018match tough\u2019 right now.\"",
      "Some fans wonder why he and others opt to participate in exhibitions at all, but players say those don't take the same sort of toll that a day-after-day tournament, or even every-other-day Slam event, does. Hard to argue with someone choosing to make a little extra money on the side, too.",
      "And players make the case that no matter how much they can switch off in November or December, part of the issue is there are not many chances to do that during other months.",
      "\u201cIdeally we\u2019d have a little bit more time. It\u2019s such a short turnaround ... after such a long season. There\u2019s not enough days to recover,\u201d said Alexei Popyrin, an Australian who upset Novak Djokovic at last year's U.S. Open. \u201cTaking time off to let your body rest might hinder the preparation, but at the end of the day, you need your body to be ready. The schedule is just so hectic throughout the year.\u201d",

      "The Golden State Warriors are soul searching after another embarrassing defeat at home, this time to the Miami Heat two days after a 30-point pounding from the Sacramento Kings",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Coach Steve Kerr criticized his Golden State Warriors for being down and lacking \u201ca competitive spirit\" in their latest embarrassing loss.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that you\u2019ve got nothing, so we\u2019ve got to find a way to build that back up,\u201d Kerr said after a 114-98 loss to the Miami Heat on Tuesday night.",
      "That followed a 30-point pounding from the Sacramento Kings two nights earlier.",
      "Draymond Green is calling for the Warriors to rediscover their soul.",
      "Stephen Curry is making it clear he can hardly do it all himself.",
      "At one moment in the second half on Tuesday the two-time MVP looked up at the scoreboard almost as if in disbelief about how it was going. The Warriors are missing shots and missing defensive assignments when it matters most.",
      "\u201cBack-to-back no-shows pretty much,\u201d Curry said. \u201c... Nobody's giving up hope. You've got to have a sense of urgency, though.\u201d",

      "Golden State shot 14 for 50 from 3-point range and went 40 of 98 overall (40.8%).",
      "Curry wants no finger-pointing or comparisons, just a collective effort to turn the season around \u2014 acknowledging \"this particular team hasn't done anything.\"",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day we are a team and we are all tied together, we're all accountable for the results of each night how our season ends up,\" Curry said. \u201cIt's not just a me and Draymond thing, it's not just a me thing, it's a we thing. So what we all need to do is play with confidence, play with assertiveness, play with a belief that when you step on the floor you can beat anybody. Whether it happens or not that has to be the mindset.\u201d",
      "The Warriors missed the playoffs last year then began this season a promising 12-3 and with championship aspirations as Curry and Draymond Green try to add to the four titles they've captured together.",
      "\u201cWhen you experience winning you hate losing even more,\u201d Curry said.",
      "Now, Golden State is 18-18 and tied for ninth place with San Antonio in the jammed-up Western Conference. The Warriors were a 10th seed last season and were eliminated by the Kings in the play-in tournament.",
      "Sure, forward Jonathan Kuminga is sidelined for at least a few weeks with a sprained right ankle, while guards Gary Payton II and Brandin Podziemski are expected back from injuries sometime during the upcoming four-game road trip.",
      "Frustrated fans flocked for the exits early for a second straight game at Chase Center, where the blowout by the Kings still stung.",
      "\u201cI expected better energy. I think we're suffering from a crisis of confidence right now frankly,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cYou can see it, you can feel it. I don't mind missed shots but I mind when missed shots affect the defense and the attitude. We feel deflated right now and there's no room for feeling sorry for ourselves in the NBA. In life in general. We can't let disappointment dictate our approach to a game, we have to do the opposite. We have to bring more fire, we have to outcompete our opponents when things aren't going our way.\u201d",

      "Javon Small was the best player on mediocre teams during his first three college seasons. Now he\u2019s the Big 12\u2019s leading scorer and a major reason why short-handed West Virginia is relevant again.",
      "No. 21 West Virginia was picked to finish 13th in the 16-team Big 12 under first-year coach Darian DeVries. Buoyed by its first win at Kansas last week, West Virginia (11-3, 2-1 Big 12) is ranked for the first time in two years and is off to its best start since going 15-1 in the 2017-18 season. And DeVries has the best record for a first-year coach through 14 games at West Virginia since 1960-61.",
      "That's due in no small part to Small. He leads the league in scoring at 19.5 points per game \u2014three more points than anyone else. Two of his five career double-doubles have come in the past week that included a pair of 11-rebound games. He's among the league leaders in steals and free-throw percentage.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to keep going to him,\u201d DeVries said. \u201cHe\u2019s been incredible. He\u2019s playing at a high level. I think he\u2019s one of the best guards in the country.\u201d",
      "Small spent his first two seasons at East Carolina. He averaged team-highs of 16 points and six assists in 2022-23 before a leg injury ended his season and the Pirates lost nine of their final 15 games. At Oklahoma State last year he averaged 15 points and four assists on a team that went 12-20.",
      "He chose West Virginia because he was familiar with DeVries\u2019 system at Drake and knew Chester Frazier, who spent the last three seasons as an assistant at Illinois and is now West Virginia\u2019s associate head coach. Frazier brought current WVU players Sencire Harris and Amani Hansberry with him.",
      "\u201cI just do what the team needs me to do,\u201d Small said.",
      "Small and the Mountaineers will be challenged to keep up the pace.",
      "Small has logged the most minutes in the league. Upper body injuries have sidelined standout teammates Tucker DeVries and Jayden Stone. DeVries, a two-time Missouri Valley Conference player of the year at Drake, has missed six games while Stone, a prolific scorer at Detroit Mercy last season, has yet to play this season. Hansberry missed a game last week with an ankle injury.",
      "They'll also have to continue leaning hard on their defense, which had held four opponents to 50 or fewer points.",
      "\u201cDefense is all about communication,\u201d Small said. \u201cWe all understand our spots as far as where we\u2019re supposed to be. But if there\u2019s no communication, something might slip up or break down, then we won\u2019t know what to do. So you\u2019ve always got to talk.\u201d",
      "The depleted lineup took a hit Tuesday night. Small scored 17 points but no other Mountaineers were in double figures in a 75-56 loss to Arizona that snapped West Virginia's seven-game winning streak.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fine. Injuries happen, foul trouble happens,\u201d Darian DeVries said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play. That\u2019s just part of it.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said his players weren't as physical and aggressive as in previous games.",
      "\u201cOur formula is the same,\u201d he said. \"We have to play a certain way to be successful. We understand our margin for error is not very big. If we deviate from that at all, these are the results that we get.\u201d",
      "Still, midway through the season, West Virginia has beaten three ranked teams, including a nonconference win against Arizona in November, and has already surpassed last year's win total.",
      "Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said he's impressed with how Darian DeVries has turned West Virginia around with an entirely new roster, especially considering the injuries.",
      "\u201cI mean, you win some of these close games, you beat an Arizona, you beat a Gonzaga, you beat Kansas. Are you kidding me?\" Lloyd said. \"If I was that guy\u2019s agent, I would have two more years in that contract right now.\u201d",

      "Washington's Jayden Daniels and Denver's Bo Nix are expected to make their playoff debuts on Sunday in a rare case of two rookie starting quarterbacks in the same postseason.",
      "While there are a few examples of fill-in rookies getting the nod in the playoffs, this will be just the fourth time that two rookie quarterbacks start in the same postseason after making at least six starts during the regular season.",
      "It last happened in 2012 when Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III and Russell Wilson all got playoff starts. The other times came in 2008 with Matt Ryan and Joe Flacco, and 1983 with Hall of Famers John Elway and Dan Marino.",
      "Only seven rookie quarterbacks have won playoff starts and there's never been a year when more than one did it. A rookie quarterback has never started in the Super Bowl with Brock Purdy (2022), Mark Sanchez (2009), Flacco (2008), Ben Roethlisberger (2004) and Shaun King (1999) all losing in the conference title game.",
      "Daniels and Nix have already had barrier-breaking seasons with both QBs winning at least 10 starts, producing at least 30 touchdowns rushing and passing, and accounting for at least 4,000 yards of offense on the ground and through the air.",
      "Before this season, no rookie QB had ever hit all those marks in a season.",
      "Daniels and Nix have some company when it comes to young quarterbacks with a record-tying 11 of the 14 projected starters in the postseason in their 20s.",
      "That includes four members of the 2018 draft class with Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson all having made the playoffs. This is the fifth time four QBs from the same draft class started in the same postseason with the 2018 class also doing it last season with Mason Rudolph getting the nod instead of Darnold.",
      "This year\u2019s version of the playoffs will have a familiar look.",
      "Ten of the teams that made the postseason are back after getting there last season with only Denver, Minnesota, Washington and the Chargers breaking through after missing out in 2023.",
      "The four newcomers are tied for the fewest since the NFL expanded to 12 playoff teams in 1990 with that last happening in 2015. The four previous seasons with 14 playoff teams featured at least six newcomers each season with seven new teams qualifying in 2022 and eight in 2020.",
      "All four division winners in the AFC are repeat champions with Kansas City (nine straight), Buffalo (five), Baltimore (two) and Houston (two) all going back-to-back. The only other times since the 2002 realignment that all four division winners in a conference repeated came in the 2019 AFC and the 2012 AFC.",
      "Tampa Bay won its fourth straight NFC South title and Detroit won its second straight in the NFC North, marking the third time there were six repeat division winners. It previously happened in 2012 and 2014.",
      "When it came to individual accomplishments, few teams fared better than the Cincinnati Bengals. It just didn't lead to success on the field.",
      "Ja'Marr Chase became the fifth player since the 1970 merger to win a receiving Triple Crown, leading the NFL in catches, yards receiving and TD receptions.",
      "Joe Burrow led the league in yards passing and TD passes, while Trey Hendrickson had the most sacks.",
      "No team had ever had the individual leaders in all of those categories but it didn't help the Bengals, who finished 9-8 and missed the playoffs.",
      "Posting a winning record once again wasn't good enough for the Seattle Seahawks to make the playoffs.",
      "A year after going 9-8 but missing out on the final wild-card spot to Green Bay on the strength of victory tiebreaker, the Seahawks were done in again by that seldom used tiebreaker.",
      "Seattle tied the Rams for first in the NFC West at 10-7 after splitting the season series. The teams also had identical records in the division, against common opponents and in conference games. The Rams came out ahead because the teams they beat combined for two more wins than the teams the Seahawks beat.",
      "Seattle became just the second 10-win team to miss the playoffs since the seventh team was added in each conference in 2020, with Miami also falling short after going 10-6 in 2020. Twelve other teams that won at least 10 games missed the postseason from 1990-2019, when there were six playoff teams per conference.",
      "The Seahawks became the fourth team to miss the playoffs in back-to-back seasons with winning records since 2000, with Cincinnati also falling short after going 9-8 for the second straight season. Miami came up short twice in back-to-back winning seasons, missing out on the postseason in 2002-03 and 2020-21.",
      "The Pittsburgh Steelers are stumbling into the postseason.",
      "The Steelers lost their final four games to go from being a team fighting for the top seed to a team that is the second wild-card and a heavy underdog Saturday night at AFC North champion Baltimore.",
      "Pittsburgh is just the third team to enter the playoffs on a losing streak of at least four games and the first to do it since Detroit in 1999. The Lions snuck in as a wild-card team at 8-8 that season and then lost 27-13 to Washington.",
      "The 1986 New York Jets were more similar to the Steelers, getting off to a 10-1 start before losing their final five games. New York recovered to beat Kansas City in the wild-card game before losing in double overtime at Cleveland in the divisional round.",
      "Pittsburgh has another losing streak to worry about, having lost five straight playoff games starting with the 2016 AFC title game at New England. A loss to the Ravens would leave the Steelers tied with the fourth longest playoff losing streak ever, trailing only Detroit (nine), Cincinnati (eight) and Kansas City (eight).",

      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- Ludvig Aberg will be the answer to a trivia question: He made the first birdie in TGL history.",
      "And with that, the indoor golf competition that Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy had envisioned for years was finally underway.",
      "TGL had its debut match Tuesday night, with Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick and Xander Schauffele of New York Golf Club taking on Shane Lowry, Wyndham Clark and Aberg of The Bay Golf Club in the opener. The 15-hole match took just under two hours, which is exactly how TGL envisioned this to work. Final score: The Bay 9, New York 2.",
      "\u201cThe last time I've had that much fun was probably last September,\u201d Lowry said, turning toward Clark as he said that \u2014 the obvious reference being how he and Aberg were part of the European Ryder Cup team that beat Clark and the United States in the fall of 2023.",
      "Yes, trash talk is part of TGL as well \u2014 even among teammates.",
      "\u201cLook, I had an amazing two hours,\u201d Lowry said.",
      "Lowry struck the first shot at 9:15 p.m. Four minutes later, the first hole in TGL history was complete when Aberg rolled in a 9-footer for the first point in league play. Yes, it moves that quickly.",
      "\u201cThis was just a dream conjured up,\u201d Woods said on the ESPN broadcast. \u201cRory and I were talking about it; it's hard to believe that dream came into reality and we were able to take golf into another stratosphere, really.\u201d",
      "Woods and McIlroy \u2014 part of the brain trust that put together this venture \u2014 were there, as expected. DJ Khaled was there too, milling about while players were warming up, showing off his swing with an imaginary club.",
      "The venue is a 250,000-square-foot facility at Palm Beach State College. Players hit some shots into a video screen, some off real grass, some off turf, and the bunkers are not just real sand \u2014 it's sand from Augusta National Golf Club, the same sand Woods has at his home practice facility. It's super-high-tech, with data collected off every shot.",
      "\u201cNobody had more fun than us,\u201d Clark said.",
      "Players wore microphones, there were betting options and fans surrounded the \u201ccourse\u201d in an intimate arena where music blared and noise was welcomed.",
      "\u201cA glorified man cave in a way,\u201d Fowler said.",
      "Once teams moved within 50 yards of the pin, they headed to a short-game complex \u2014 with a green that sits on a 41-yard-wide turntable and has about 600 devices underneath to change the contours. Players said it was difficult to make putts, which might be understandable.",
      "Fans cheered. And they booed \u2014 a little, anyway. Schauffele heard those after he botched a chip, part of a night where not much went right for his team.",
      "\u201cI probably would have booed me too,\u201d Schauffele said.",
      "The players seemed to love it. Lowry had one-liner after one-liner. A couple of examples:",
      "\u2014 \u201cI'm going to be the Scottie Scheffler of indoor golf.\u201d",
      "\u2014 \u201cA bit like myself. A bit chunky,\u201d he said after one shot came up a touch short.",
      "It ended with a 729-yard par-5 \u2014 a reachable 729-yard par-5, if that makes any sense. Handshakes and cheers all around when it was over, Lowry gave a big wave to the fans and the night was done.",
      "\u201cSo much fun,\" Aberg said.",
      "Woods loved it when some fans were, let's say, not exactly quiet as Clark lined up a putt on one of the early holes.",
      "\u201cYou don't normally hear that at events,\u201d Woods said. \u201cYou're going to hear that here.\u201d",
      "Woods is expected to debut for his Jupiter Links club on Jan. 14. McIlroy's debut could be Jan. 27 when Boston Common plays Jupiter Links. The regular season goes until March 4. There are 24 players \u2014 six teams of four \u2014 and the top four teams advance to the playoffs with a best-of-three championship series two weeks before the Masters.",
      "Each team activates three players for a match, and the 15-hole competitions will be done in about two hours. It'll all be shown on ESPN platforms, often in prime time. The league has been in the works for a few years; the original plan was for it to start last year, but a storm slowed construction and organizers pushed the debut back to 2025.",
      "\u201cIt's not traditional golf, yes,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut it is golf. And that's the main thing.\u201d",
      "And, as Fowler pointed out, the crowd in the arena is one thing, but how television viewers accept it will be the big test.",
      "\u201cIf it does well there, the sky\u2019s the limit with what you can do,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cYou can put up arenas in different places. This is just the start.\u201d",

      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice to be his administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",

      "But not all innovation is good, according to a panel of self-described dystopia experts that has judged some products as \u201cWorst in Show.\" The award that no company wants to win calls out the \u201cleast repairable, least private, and least sustainable products on display.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more of these things that have basically surveillance technology built into them, and it enables some cool things,\u201d Liz Chamberlain, director of sustainability at the e-commerce site iFixit told The Associated Press. \u201cBut it also means that now we\u2019ve got microphones and cameras in our washing machines, refrigerators and that really is an industry-wide problem.\u201d",

      "The rings, which come in colors like dune and desert sand, cost $2,200. Wiens said the jewelry \u201clooks sleek but hides a major flaw: its battery only lasts 500 charges.\u201d Worse, he said, is the fact that replacing the battery is impossible without destroying the device entirely.",

      "TP-Link's Archer BE900 router won for \u201cleast secure\u201d of CES. The company is a top-selling router brand in the U.S. But its products are vulnerable to hacking, said Paul Roberts, founder of The Security Ledger.",

      "An international team of scientists announced Thursday they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles (2.8 kilometers) to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice they say is at least 1.2 million years old.",
      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",
      "The European Union funded Beyond EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) with support from nations across the continent. Italy is coordinating the project.",
      "The announcement was exciting to Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State who was not involved with the project and who was recently awarded the National Medal of Science for his career studying ice sheets.",
      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",

      "\u201cHuge rivers like the Amazon can appear mighty, but at the same time freshwater environments are very fragile,\u201d said study co-author Patricia Charvet, a biologist at Brazil's Federal University of Cear\u00e1.",
      "Freshwater habitats \u2013 including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, bogs and wetlands \u2013 cover less than 1% of the planet\u2019s surface, but support 10% of its animal species, said Catherine Sayer, a zoologist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in England.",

Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",

And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company show the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",

      "But, Stevens added, this also shows how promising the integration of technology like AI can be \u2014 such as with in-car voice assistants. If you can \u201chave a conversation with your car\u201d to ask for detailed directions or restaurant suggestions, he explains, that can reduce distractions like trying to reach for your phone.",
      "In addition to in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week also put a spotlight on the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand access sources for consumers. In addition to a previously-announced venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America, Honda on Tuesday said it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately",
      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",

      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

    "story": [
      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",
      "Channel 12 declined to say which AI program it was using.",
      "Nussbaum had worried that ALS would rob him of the career he loved. In an interview with Channel 12, he recounted telling his managers \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pitying me, doing me a favor,\" he said. \"The day you come to the conclusion that this is it \u2014 tell me. I\u2019ll know how to accept it without a problem.\u201d",
      "He calls his new AI-enabled persona a \u201cmagic trick\u201d that enabled his comeback, and believes it will raise awareness in Israel of ways that people with disabilities \u2014 especially progressive disabilities \u2014 can continue to work.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Channel 12 and my news managers are allowing me to reinvent myself anew, that is one of the most important medicines I can get in my fight with this disease,\u201d he said."

      "Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region are searching for more survivors and victims, one day after a strong earthquake leveled thousands of houses and killed at least 126 people near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists",
      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",
      "\u201cEven young people couldn\u2019t run out of the houses when the earthquake hit, let alone old people and children,\u201d Tsering Phuntsog said.",
      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",
      "Guo expressed confidence that the people in the earthquake zone would be able to rebuild under \u201cthe strong leadership\u201d of the Communist Party.",

      "When he was still a boy making the long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes.",
      "As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.",
      "The aircraft \u2014 known as \"electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL \u2014 lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,\u201d Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California \u2014 located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains.",
      "Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eVTOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called \u201cMidnight\u201d could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November.",
      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",
      "While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eVTOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals.",
      "The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion.",
      "But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. \u201ceVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.\u201d"

He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.",
      "\u201cThe amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\u201d Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \u201cIt would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",

    "story": [
      "A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of its visitors was largely blocked in court before taking effect Jan. 1",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify their visitors' age was largely blocked in court before it was to take effect Jan. 1, even as similar laws kicked in for Florida and South Carolina and remained in effect for more than a dozen other states.",
      "On Dec. 30, U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman in Memphis ruled that Tennessee's law would likely suppress the First Amendment free speech rights of adults without actually preventing children from accessing the harmful material in question. The state attorney general's office is appealing the decision.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment trade group, is suing over Tennessee's law and those in a half-dozen other states. The coalition lists some 19 states that have passed similar laws. One prominent adult website has cut off access in several states due to their laws.",
      "The issue will hit the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments regarding Texas' law next week.",
      "No one voted against Tennessee's law last year when it passed the Republican-supermajority legislature, and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on it.",
      "The law would require porn websites to verify visitors are at least 18 years old, threatening felony penalties and civil liability possible for violators running the sites. They could match a photo to someone's ID, or use certain \u201cpublic or private transactional data\u201d to prove someone\u2019s age. Website leaders could not retain personally identifying information and would have to keep anonymized data.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition and other plaintiffs sued, winning a preliminary injunction that blocks the attorney general from enforcement while court proceedings continue. However, the coalition expressed concern that private lawsuits or actions by individual district attorneys could be possible.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Lipman wrote that parental controls on minors' devices are more effective and less restrictive.",
      "She wrote that under Tennessee's law, minors still could access adult sites using VPNs, or virtual private networks, that mask a user's location. Or, they could view pornographic material on social media sites, which are unlikely to reach the law's threshold of one-third of its content considered harmful to minors.",
      "The judge also said the impact could be overly broad, potentially affecting other plaintiffs such as an online educational platform focused on sexual wellness.",
      "She noted that Tennessee's definition of \u201ccontent harmful to minors\u201d extends to include text. She specifically mentioned that the phrase \u201cthe human nipple,\u201d or crude combinations of keyboard characters, would be considered harmful as long as they lack \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\"",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office is asking the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let the law take effect as the lawsuit proceeds. His spokesperson, Chad Kubis, noted that other appeals courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed similar laws to take effect.",
      "\u201cThe Protect Tennessee Minors Act institutes common sense age verification to stop kids from accessing explicit obscene content while protecting the privacy of adults who choose to do so,\" Kubis said.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition has argued the law would be ineffective, unconstitutional and force people to transfer sensitive information.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something as trivial as a mention of the human nipple,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden.",
      "As verification laws took effect in Florida and South Carolina last week, website PornHub cut off access there and posted a message encouraging people to contact political decision-makers. They've acted similarly in other states that passed verification requirements.",
      "Judges had paused the laws in Indiana and Texas. But circuit appeals courts stepped in to allow enforcement.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to halt Texas' law in April while the court action continues. The next step is Supreme Court oral arguments on Jan. 15.",
      "Another age verification law is set to begin in July in Georgia."

      "CES, the annual trade show of all-things tech, is upon us",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 CES, the annual trade show of all things tech, is upon us.",
      "The multi-day event, organized by the Consumer Technology Association, kicks off this week in Las Vegas \u2014 where swaths of the latest gadgets and advances across industries like personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more are set to be on display. And, like last year, artificial intelligence is everywhere you look.",
      "CES 2024 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the CTA, and organizers expect to see at least that amount again for this year's show. Over 4,500 exhibitors, including 1,400 startups, are also anticipated across 2.5 million net square feet of floor space this week.",
      "\u201cThese are the people getting together, focusing on solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and magic occurs.\u201d Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the CTA, told The Associated Press ahead of this week's show.",
      "Formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, CES brings attendees and exhibitors from around the globe, with Shapiro noting that organizers expect some 50,000 attendees to come from outside the U.S. Beyond an array of startups, big-name companies set to make appearances this year include Nvidia, Delta Air Lines, Honda, Volvo, Panasonic and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.",
      "There may be some increased security this year. CES 2025 arrives less than one week after a highly decorated Army soldier fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives before it burst into flames outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 not far from much of the trade show's planned event space. Shapiro said that organizers regularly work with officials for event safety and that \u201cmodest\u201d changes were made in response to recent events, but couldn't go into further detail.",
      "The AP spoke with Shapiro about what to expect for CES 2025. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "CES 2025 will be an exceptional leap forward in terms of innovation and technology, with a focus on a variety of themes important to the future of humanity. Over 4,000 companies will be here, on literally miles and miles of exhibit space. And they\u2019ll be showing solutions to fundamental human problems \u2014 like access to food, clean air, clean water and mobility, as well as health care technology.",
      "We also have newer categories. We\u2019re seeing more technology for the disability community, for example. Products that can serve people with disabilities had a large presence last year, and we expect that to be even bigger this year. Overall, the show is serving humanity and using technology and innovation to fill in gaps where we need a lot more work.",
      "Generative AI is affecting virtually every area. Just about every major exhibitor will be talking about AI in one form or another at CES this week. For businesses, the focus is more on enterprise and productivity. But for individuals, it\u2019s about personalization.",
      "We\u2019ll see exhibitors, such as PC companies, focusing on personalization in new products for the PC and laptop marketplace. And then there\u2019s AI being used in mobility \u2014 and not just in features for cars and self-driving. It\u2019s for all sorts of vehicles, including agricultural products from companies like Caterpillar and John Deere.",
      "The industry representing the companies involved welcomes government regulation. The government\u2019s job is to say this is what is unsafe. And so the companies know what is legal and what is not. At the same time, a big challenge is if government stops innovation \u2014 so the question is for every country is finding that balance.",
      "We expect the Trump administration to take a much more pro-business approach that favors innovation, including a focus on all sorts of energy sources, which is very important important. But tariffs are taxes. And we know that they are inflationary and paid for by consumers.",
      "If we go forward with the proposals that the President-elect has indicated he may put in place, there would be severe impacts on the prosperity of the U.S. It depends on how exactly these tariffs are adopted but under some of the proposals, we estimate a range of a 30 to 50% price increases for basic products like PCs, cell phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches and all sorts of different products that consumers get a great value on today. That means that fewer people will be able to access these products. And, of course, other countries may then retaliate against U.S. exports. We don\u2019t want to go in that direction.",
      "CES has always focused on safety. There\u2019s a lot of things we can\u2019t talk about, but suffice it to say, we work with federal, state, local and facility officials for lots of planning. We\u2019ve made some modest changes given the recent events, but we\u2019re always trying to do it better.",
      "I think companies are excited to come here. And any requests we\u2019ve gotten have been extremely isolated.",
      "Having top executives here, especially after COVID, is very special. People are focused on coming to Las Vegas and having this opportunity to meet face-to-face and finding the serendipity and discovery that happens when you\u2019re making these business connections in person. That\u2019s why trade shows like CES and others are such important events for the world."

      "The FBI says the New Orleans truck attacker who killed 14 people had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses",
      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",
      "The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you're on the move. And there's no display in the lens, so there isn't a viewfinder for framing photos or video.",
      "There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you're shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can't disable this light to be more discreet in your actions."

    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "Data collected by Tesla on the driver and vehicle in the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion and then shared with law enforcement has shined a spotlight on a difficult ethical question for the auto industry: Are companies violating your privacy rights",
      "NEW YORK -- Your car is spying on you.",
      "That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.",
      "Is your car company violating your privacy rights?",
      "\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d",
      "Many of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.",
      "The data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.",
      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",
      "Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d",
      "General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.",
      "Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.",
      "Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.",
      "\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \"Your information is kept private and secure.\u201d",
      "Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d",
      "Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.",
      "Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.",
      "\u201cThe fire is out,\u201d the police announced on the social media platform X, one of Musk\u2019s other companies. \u201cPlease avoid the area.\u201d",
      "Tesla shortly thereafter swung into action.",
      "\u201cThe whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything.\u201d",
      "Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger\u2019s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.",
      "There are no federal laws regulating car data similar to those that restrict information collection and sharing by banks and health care providers. And state laws are a grab-bag of various rules, mostly focused on data privacy in general.",
      "Daniels, the privacy consultant, thinks that new national laws are needed because rules have not kept up with technology.",

      "I write not to elicit sympathy, but to underscore how real and how pervasive the threat feels to the millions in this windstorm's cross hairs.",
      "We all know the dreaded fire could ignite anywhere, sprouting like seeds in the wind, no matter which exclusive neighborhood you might call home, or how far from a fire zone your insurance carrier says you are. So many of us have go-bags packed."

      "The Biden administration\u2019s Title IX rules expanding protections for LGBTQ+ students have been struck down nationwide after a federal judge in Kentucky found that they overstepped the president\u2019s authority",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration\u2019s Title IX rules expanding protections for LGBTQ+ students have been struck down nationwide after a federal judge in Kentucky found they overstepped the president\u2019s authority.",
      "In a decision issued Thursday, U.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves scrapped the entire 1,500-page regulation after deciding it was \u201cfatally\u201d tainted by legal shortcomings. The rule had already been halted in 26 states after a wave of legal challenges by Republican states.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump previously promised to end the rules \u201con day one\u201d and made anti-transgender themes a centerpiece of his campaign.",
      "The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia.",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti called it a rejection of the Biden administration's \u201crelentless push to impose a radical gender ideology.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause the Biden rule is vacated altogether, President Trump will be free to take a fresh look at our Title IX regulations when he returns to office,\u201d Skrmetti said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately comment on the decision.",
      "The Biden administration ignited controversy when it finalized the new rules last year. The regulation expanded Title IX, a 1972 law forbidding discrimination based on sex in education, to also prevent discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. It also widened the definition of harassment to include a broader range of misconduct.",
      "Civil rights advocates hailed it as a victory, saying it gave LGBTQ+ students new recourse against discrimination. But it drew outrage from conservatives who said it could be used to protect transgender athletes in girls' sports.",
      "The rule didn't explicitly address athletics and mostly detailed how schools and colleges were required to respond to cases of discrimination and sexual assault. A separate proposal dealing with transgender athletes in sports was put on the back-burner and later revoked after it became a focal point of Trump\u2019s campaign.",
      "In his decision, Reeves found the Education Department overstepped its authority by expanding the scope of Title IX.",
      "There\u2019s nothing in the 1972 law suggesting that it should cover any more than it has since Congress created it, Reeves wrote. He called it an \u201cattempt to bypass the legislative process and completely transform Title IX.\u201d",
      "The judge also found that it violated free speech rights by requiring teachers to use pronouns aligning with a student\u2019s gender identity.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment does not permit the government to chill speech or compel affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees in this manner,\u201d Reeves wrote.",
      "Rather than carve out certain aspects of the rule, Reeves decided it was best to toss the regulation in its entirety and revert to a previous interpretation of Title IX. He said his decision will \u201csimply \u2018cause a return to the status quo\u2019 that existed for more than 50 years prior to its effective date.\u201d",
      "Among the biggest critics of the rule was Betsy DeVos, former education secretary during Trump's first term. On the social media site X, she wrote that the \u201cradical, unfair, illegal, and absurd Biden Title IX re-write is GONE.\u201d",
      "Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said Biden's rule \u201cbetrayed the original intent of Title IX by removing longstanding protections that ensured fairness for women and girls.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith President Trump and a Republican majority in Congress, we will ensure women and girls have every opportunity to succeed on the field and in the classroom,\" Cassidy said in a statement.",

      "\"Governor Gavin Newscum should immediately go to Northern California and open up the water main, and let the water flow into his dry, starving, burning State, instead of having it go out into the Pacific Ocean,\" the president-elect wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"It ought to be done right now, NO MORE EXCUSES FROM THIS INCOMPETENT GOVERNOR.

      "Biden on Thursday convened senior White House and administration officials for a briefing on the federal response to the wildfires, and officials noted that the problem was the electrical outages preventing water from flowing rather than a lack of water in the region.",
      "\"I want to be clear, what I know from talking to the governor, that there are concerns out there that there's also been a water shortage. The fact is, the utilities understandably shut off power because they are worried the lines that they're -- they carried energy were gonna be blown down and spark additional fires. But the CAL Fire, when it did that, it cut off the ability to generate pumping the water. That's what caused the lack of water in these hydrants,\" Biden said.",

      "The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, on Thursday urged Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito to recuse himself from any consideration of President-elect Donald Trump's efforts to block his sentencing for his conviction in his hush money case in New York following ABC News' reporting of a Tuesday phone call between Trump and Alito.",
      "\"Yesterday, we learned that President-elect Trump spoke to Justice Alito just hours before Trump asked the Supreme Court to halt his criminal sentencing in New York. Justice Alito brushed off this startling ex parte private phone call and breach of judicial ethics by asserting that this perfectly timed conversation actually regarded his recommendation of a former clerk for an administration job,\" Raskin said in a statement.",
      "\"Especially when paired with his troubling past partisan ideological activity in favor of Trump, Justice Alito's decision to have a personal phone call with President Trump\u2014who obviously has an active and deeply personal matter before the court\u2014makes clear that he fundamentally misunderstands the basic requirements of judicial ethics or, more likely, believes himself to be above judicial ethics altogether.\"",
      "ABC News reported that the call came just hours before before Trump's lawyers on Wednesday morning filed an emergency request with the justices asking them to block a New York judge from moving forward with sentencing Trump in his criminal hush money case on Friday.",
      "In his statement, Raskin said, \"Justice Alito has made his political leanings and support for the president-elect clear, whether it be his display of flags in apparent support of the January 6th insurrectionists and the 'Stop the Steal' movement, or his self-proclaimed ideological battle with 'the Left.'\"",
      "\"In our democracy, Americans expect their cases to be heard by impartial judges,\" he said.",
      "Alito told ABC News the call concerned a job recommendation for one of his former clerks in the new administration.",
      "\"William Levi, one of my former law clerks, asked me to take a call from President-elect Trump regarding his qualifications to serve in a government position,\" the justice said Wednesday. \"I agreed to discuss this matter with President-elect Trump, and he called me yesterday afternoon.\"",
      "Alito said that he and Trump did not discuss his hush money case.",
      "\"We did not discuss the emergency application he filed today, and indeed, I was not even aware at the time of our conversation that such an application would be filed,\" Alito said. \"We also did not discuss any other matter that is pending or might in the future come before the Supreme Court or any past Supreme Court decisions involving the President-elect.\"",
      "It is not unusual for a sitting justice to offer a job recommendation for a former clerk, but it is rare, court analysts said, for a justice to have such a conversation directly with a sitting president or president-elect, especially one with an active stake in business pending before the court.",
      "The court is expected to weigh in on Trump's request by Friday morning.",
      "The hush money case is not the only one before the Supreme Court that Trump has an interest in. On Friday, the court will hear a last-ditch challenge to a law that would ban the video-sharing app TikTok on Jan. 19 unless its Chinese-based parent company sells its stake.",
      "Trump asked the court in a filing late last month to pause the divestiture deadline in order to give him a chance to reach a \"negotiated resolution\" to save the app once he takes office on Jan. 20."

      "Garland informed members of Congress -- as required by internal department regulations -- that at no time did he interfere in to overrule Smith during the process of his probes, according to the letter released by the Department of Justice.",
      "Garland also acknowledged in the letter that at this time he is currently barred by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon from releasing the report outside of the Justice Department, but that he intends to make Volume One of the report, regarding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election, available to the public once he is \"permitted to do so\" by the courts.",
      "The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing whether to block the release of the report after Cannon, the judge who dismissed Trump's classified documents case, temporarily blocked the report's release in order to prevent \"irreparable harm,\" while the matter is considered by the Eleventh Circuit.",

      "\"The report is nothing less than another attempted political hit job whose sole purpose is to disrupt the presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power,\" Trump's lawyers wrote.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued that the release of the report would be \"worse\" than the four indictments Smith brought against the former president, by offering a \"one-sided\" view of the evidence without giving Trump the ability to defend himself.",
      "\"The Final Report goes into more detail about the alleged crimes President Trump and others supposedly committed and involves evidence that was never released to the public--indeed, evidence that could not be released, such as those involving official acts,\" the filing said.",
      "Trump's lawyers claimed that Cannon's decision deeming Smith's appointment unconstitutional taints the report -- which they described as an \"extension of the unlawful acts of an unconstitutionally appointed and funded officer\" -- which should prohibit Garland from releasing it.",
      "\"Garland simply functions as a mouthpiece for the unconstitutionally-appointed Smith,\" the filing said.",
      "Garland, in his letter to Congress, confirmed that he plans to make available Volume Two of the report, pertaining to Trump's classified documents case, available to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees for closed-door review as soon as the Eleventh Circuit permits him to do so.",
      "\"Consistent with local court rules and Department policy, and to avoid any risk of prejudice to defendants Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, whose criminal cases remain pending, I have determined, at the recommendation of the Special Counsel, that Volume Two should not be made public so long as those defendants' criminal proceedings are ongoing,\" Garland wrote.",
      "\"I have determined that once those criminal proceedings have concluded, releasing Volume Two of the Report to you and to the public would also be in the public interest, consistent with law and Department policy,\" he wrote.",

      "Trump pleaded not guilty in 2023 to 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House, after prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to return hundreds of documents containing classified information and took steps to thwart the government's efforts to get the documents back. He later pleaded not guilty to separate charges of undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election in an effort to subvert democracy and remain in power.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 21:35:42 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is meeting with Senate Republicans to try to get lawmakers \"on the same page\" on how to advance some of his major policy initiatives.",
    "story": [
      "After meeting on the Hill, senators appear unmoved by Trump's argument.",
      "After meeting with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump appeared ambivalent about the debate over whether to craft two legislative attempts to reshape fiscal policy for his agenda or settle on one sweeping package in an \u201call-in\u201d approach.",
      "Trump told reporters that he had \u201ca great meeting\u201d with the senators, although it appeared that the closed-door meeting that lasted more than 90 minutes did not lock down an agreement on how to proceed.",
      "\u201cThere's great unity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think there's a lot of talk about two [bills], and there's a lot of talk about one, but it doesn't matter. The end result is the same. We're going to get something done that's going to be reducing taxes and creating a lot of jobs and all of the other things that you know about.\u201d",
      "Despite Trump's comments, senators in the room heard Trump loud and clear: His preference, though he's open to alternative ideas, is one \"big, beautiful bill\" to deal with many of his legislative priorities in a single swoop.",
      "But just because senators heard him doesn't mean they agree with him.",
      "There was hope going into tonight's meeting with Trump, the Senate's first since he won the presidential race in November, that it could bring the Senate, which has largely favored a two-bill approach, and the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson prefers a one-bill approach, into one line of thinking on the matter.",
      "Senators leaving the room Wednesday night seemed unmoved.",
      "\"It's no mystery we're advocating for two,\" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said as he departed.",
      "There were a number of senators, including Trump allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who forcefully made the case for a two-bill solution while in the room with Trump. Cruz and his allies want one bill to address border security, military spending and energy. A second bill addressing tax policy could come later, they said.",
      "With little to no support expected from Democrats, Republicans plan to push forward through \"reconciliation\" -- a fast-track process limited to spending and revenue legislation that needs only a majority rather than the 60-vote threshold in the Senate needed to pass legislation.",
      "While the debate might seem in the weeds, it could have serious implications for Trump's agenda. Bills passed through reconciliation give Republicans more wiggle room to pass certain measures that Democrats oppose. But these bills are cumbersome, bound by a number of rules about what may and may not be included, and will require the near-unanimous support of Republicans.",
      "Senate Republicans continue to break with Trump and Johnson on the issue because they believe they can notch a win early in Trump's presidency by breaking the package into two chunks.",
      "\"I expressed vigorously, as did numerous other people that the best path to success is winning two major victories rather than putting all the eggs in one basket and risking -- a very real risk -- of it not getting the votes to pass,\" Cruz said. \"I strongly believe the path that makes sense is to take up two bills. Why? Because that unifies Republicans. We can get that passed. We could have a major victory early on, and then to move to extending the tax cuts.\"",
      "Cruz said there was \"complete consensus\" among the senators on a two-part solution. \"Not a single senator disagreed.\"",
      "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W. Va., who told reporters she served as the moderator for the meeting, said Trump was listening intently to their suggestions but she believes two bills provide the most viable path to victory.",
      "\u201cThe two-bill approach that [Senate Majority Leader John] Thune had liked, I think is generally the direction the Senate has been wanting to go to get that quick victory,\u201d Capito said. \u201cI think there's a lot of discussion that's going to go on. What can the House pass? What does the Speaker think? So he [Trump] heard from us and from our leader that a two-bill strategy is very much alive over here and something we're still very interested in. So no decisions were made.\".",
      "Capito seemed uncertain if there would be cohesion with Trump moving forward.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know -- we\u2019ll see,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think, you know, the leaders will get together with the president and they'll make those decisions.\u201d",
      "Republican Whip John Barrasso will be a key part of rounding up votes for whatever package is ultimately advanced and he also sees two bills as the right direction to go.",
      "\"We think there's a lot of advantages to get an early win and to focus immediately on the border, on energy and on the strong military,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Barrasso said he was there when the Senate used this same fast-track budget tool to implement the Trump tax cuts in 2017. That took time, he said.",
      "\"There's a lot of detail to be done with that, and so that's going to take awhile\" he said. \"I think we can much more quickly deal with the border, energy, and military funding.\"",
      "Still, Trump continues to prefer the one-bill approach backed by Johnson, senators said.",
      "\"I think he's still open to whatever can work. I think there seems to be movement from the House to do one, and so I think that's the way he leans,\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said.",
      "Another option that was floated was holding a \"horse race\" which would see the House originating a sweeping proposal that includes tax policy as its base while the Senate originates a more narrowly tailored bill that just includes border and energy reform then see which package gains more momentum.",
      "\"I said, 'Well, Mister President, you love a horse race, why don't you set it up as a horse race? And then whatever works best is great,'\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D. \"HIs preference is one bill, but I think he's open to it.\"",
      "Trump reiterated his preference for one bill when he spoke to reporters on Tuesday, but said he could live with two.",
      "\"Well, I like one big, beautiful bill, and I always have, I always will, he said. But if two is more certain [to pass], it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff early,\" he said.",
      "Johnson said he hopes to have a bill ready by the first week in April, but it remains to be seen if he can get fiscal conservatives in his conference, who have long opposed all-in-one bills like the one Johnson is proposing, on board.",
      "The speaker pushed back on Wednesday about the one-bill approach being a kitchen sink approach.",
      "\u201cThis is not an omnibus spending bill, but appropriation,\" Johnson said. \"This is reducing spending, which is an objective we talked about. I'll keep reiterating this: that just because the debt limit is raised, to give stability the bond markets and to send a message around the world that we will pay the nation's debt. We are doggedly determined to decrease the size of scope of government and to limit spending, cut spending so you can you'll see both of those things happen simultaneously.\"",
      "Johnson also intends to handle the debt limit in the reconciliation bill -- without Democratic support.",
      "\"That way, as the Republican Party, the party in charge of both chambers, we again get to determine the details of that. If it runs through the regular order, regular process\u2026 then you have to have both parties negotiating. And we feel like we are in better stead to do it ourselves,\" he said Tuesday.",
      "But it remains to be seen whether Johnson can sell the fiscal conservatives in his conference on that idea. They nearly derailed the short-term government funding bill to avert a shutdown last month after Trump demanded that it dealt with the debt ceiling.",
      "Trump will meet with groups of House Republicans at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida this weekend.",
      "\"He's bringing in big groups of House Republicans to Mar-a-Lago over the weekend three days in a row to meet with and talk with all of our team members about what's ahead of us and the challenges and how we can accomplish all this together,\" Johnson said, though the speaker is not expected to attend.",

I will meet with an have conversations with anyone if it helps me deliver for Pennsylvania and the nation.\"",
      "Fetterman, once branded as a progressive, has increasingly signaled he's willing to act more independently.",
      "He was one of the first Democrats in the Senate to meet with Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, and he's expressed willingness to back some of Trump's other Cabinet nominees.",

      "Former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte has been sworn in as the 83rd governor of New Hampshire",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte was sworn as the 83rd governor of New Hampshire on Thursday, promising to bring people together and prodding young people to \u201cstep up and contribute.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am going to be a governor for you, whether you\u2019re a Republican, Democrat, independent, you name it. Our state is so much bigger than a party or an ideology,\u201d she said in remarks prepared for delivery. \u201cGood government knows no party, so let\u2019s show folks that even when partisanship is at a fever pitch, we can set a different example.\u201d",
      "Ayotte succeeds fellow Republican Chris Sununu, whose decision against seeking a fifth two-year term set up on one of the most competitive gubernatorial races in the country. Promising to continue Sununu's anti-tax, pro-business economic policies, Ayotte defeated five opponents in September\u2019s GOP primary and Democratic former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in the November election.",
      "In her inaugural speech, Ayotte said she would keep the state on a prosperous path but warned that belt-tightening would be necessary as lawmakers write the next two-year budget.",
      "\"We are going to have to look to find better ways to do things with fewer dollars,\" she said. \u201cJust like that family making hard decisions, there\u2019s things we can\u2019t skimp on \u2014 protecting our most vulnerable and serving those most in need.\u201d",
      "Ayotte is the third woman to be elected governor of New Hampshire, following Democrats Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both of whom are now U.S. senators. They were the first and second women in the nation to serve in the Senate after being governor. Ayotte is the first woman to do so in reverse, according to Eric Ostermeier, a research fellow at the University of Minnesota and author of the Smart Politics news site.",
      "While more than 150 sitting or former governors have become senators, Ayotte is among just 23 sitting or former senators elected governor since 1900, Ostermeier said. In an interview in October, Ayotte said that experience will serve her well.",
      "\u201cNot only do I understand how Washington works, but also how to fight for New Hampshire. I still have relationships there, across the aisle, with important people making decisions in Washington,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I do feel like it does broaden my skill set as governor doing this in reverse.\u201d",
      "A narrow loss to Hassan in 2016 ended Ayotte\u2019s tenure in Washington after one term. Before that, Ayotte spent five years as the state\u2019s attorney general, and she often highlighted her past as a prosecutor during her campaign.",
      "She repeated that Thursday, saying her top priority remains keeping the state safe. She also cited the state's housing crisis as a top issue she plans to tackle, and she praised Republicans for expanding the state's school voucher program. Without offering details, she also announced plans to ban cellphones in schools.",
      "\u201cScreens are negatively impacting our learning environments, drawing students\u2019 attention away from their classes, and becoming a barrier for teachers to do their jobs,\u201d she said. \"No more.\u201d",
      "Ayotte said she looks forward to talking to students visiting the Statehouse and urging them to embrace public service.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t teach our kids about it, they aren\u2019t going to learn it,\" she said. \"It is so important to root our lives in something bigger than ourselves, and it is critical to the health of our state and our communities that our next generation step up and contribute.\u201d"

      "Nearly a decade ago, intense protests over racial injustice rocked the University of Missouri\u2019s flagship campus, leading to the resignation of two top administrators. The university then hired its first-ever vice chancellor for inclusion, diversity and equity. Tensions were so high that football players were threatening a boycott and a graduate student went on hunger strike.",

      "Dozens of diversity, equity and inclusion programs have already closed in states including Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, Iowa, Nebraska and Texas. In some cases, lessons about racial and gender identity have been phased out. Supports and resources for underrepresented students have disappeared. Some students say changes in campus climate have led them to consider dropping out.",
      "During his campaign, Trump vowed to end \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201cleftist indoctrination\u201d in education. He pledged to dismantle diversity programs that he says amount to discrimination, and to impose fines on colleges \"up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "Many conservatives have taken a similar view. Erec Smith, a research fellow at the free-market Cato Institute whose scholarship examines anti-racist activism and Black conservatism, said DEI sends the message that \u201cwhiteness is oppression.\" Diversity efforts are \"thoroughly robbing Black people and other minorities of a sense of agency,\" he said.",

Ron DeSantis\u2019 \u201cwar on woke.\u201d DeSantis overhauled the school\u2019s Board of Trustees in 2023, appointing a new majority of conservative allies, including culture war strategist Christopher Rufo.",

      "Pushback is exactly what DEI programs have faced.",
      "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, in March signed into law a bill barring state funding for public colleges that advocate for \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d including that someone should feel guilty because of their race or gender. The law also states people at schools and colleges must use the bathroom that matches their gender assigned at birth.",
      "The effects of the anti-DEI law rippled through campuses including the University of Alabama and Auburn University, the state\u2019s two largest four-year colleges. DEI offices and designated areas for LGBTQ+ and Black students closed when classes started in late August  \u2014 just before the law took effect.",
      "Dakota Grimes, a graduate student in chemistry, was disappointed when Auburn University closed the campus\u2019 Pride Center, a designated safe space for LGBTQ+ people and allies. Grimes' organization, Sexuality and Gender Alliance, still meets regularly in the library, she said, but LGBTQ+ students don\u2019t feel as welcome on campus. Students are subjected to homophobic and transphobic slurs, Grimes said.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t feel safe just sitting in the student center because of the kind of environment that a lot of students and even teachers create on campus,\u201d Grimes said.",
      "Julia Dominguez, a political science senior at the University of Alabama and president of the Hispanic-Latino Association, said funding for the group\u2019s annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival was pulled two weeks before the event in September.

A 2024 law banned written \u201cdiversity statements\u201d in higher education hiring and student admissions.",

      "For Douglas and many others, the struggle for civil rights that prompted diversity efforts isn\u2019t a thing of the past. \u201cWhite people might have moved past it, but Black people are still experiencing it,\u201d he said.",

      "New Mexico's top prosecutor is suing Western New Mexico University's regents and outgoing president",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico\u2019s top prosecutor is suing Western New Mexico University's regents and outgoing president to try to undo a lucrative severance package that included a nearly $2 million payout approved in the wake of a scathing report that detailed wasteful spending and lax financial oversight at the school.",
      "State Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez outlined a number of allegations that included breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of the state's open meetings law and state constitution. He also raised questions about who at the university rushed to issue a check to Shepard, noting that some regents already had resigned amid pressure from the governor.",
      "The attorney general's office initially filed an emergency motion in state district court seeking to delay any payouts to Shepard, not knowing that a check already had been issued on Jan. 2.",
      "The state is now seeking to prohibit Shepherd from spending the money and asking the court to establish a trust where it could be deposited until the legal dispute is resolved.",
      "Despite requests for documentation from the university, Torrez said his office has not received any records that would show who initiated the negotiations around Shepard's departure. He suggested the process has been tainted by greed and arrogance and that students will pay the price.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely disgraceful that the people who have been entrusted with making sure that they get the education they need to build a better future have instead used that opportunity to enrich themselves, to go on lavish taxpayer funded trips, and then when they are held to account, to hand out a golden parachute to one of their pals,\" Torrez said. That will not stand.\u201d",
      "Shepard's legal team disputed the attorney general's claims, saying regents are responsible for negotiating and approving executive compensation and severance agreements and that notices appeared in the local newspaper that the board would be discussing the president's contract during a Dec. 20 meeting.",
      "John Anderson, an attorney for Shepard, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the board had appointed a subcommittee to negotiate the separation agreement before unanimously approving it.",
      "\u201cThis entire process was handled appropriately, legally and transparently,\u201d Anderson wrote. \u201cDr. Shepard did not expedite his payment. Any allegations to the contrary have no legal or factual basis.\u201d",
      "According to court documents, the university agreed to pay Shepard more than three times the amount required if it had terminated his employment without cause. The agreement also guarantees Shepard a spot as a tenured faculty member, earning at least $200,000 annually for five years. He can serve remotely and was given an eight-month sabbatical with full pay.",
      "The leadership shakeup follows an investigation by the state auditor's office that found more than $363,000 in wasteful spending and improper use of public funds.",
      "State lawmakers started raising questions in 2023 about Shepard's spending on international trips and on high-end furniture and about his wife, Valerie Plame\u2019s, use of a university purchasing card. At the time, Shepard said regents vetted his spending requests and that he was familiar with policies governing the use of public money.",
      "The events could prompt lawmakers to consider new legislation during the session that begins this month.",
      "House Speaker Javier Martinez on Thursday said he would support changes to ensure public institutions are managed in the best interests of students and taxpayers, rather than for personal enrichment of university officials.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, this is about safeguarding the money of the people of the state of New Mexico, and this is about ensuring that no one is above the law,\u201d he said."

      "The trip marks Fetterman's continuing evolution from a leading surrogate for President Joe Biden into a Trump-friendly lawmaker since Trump won the premier battleground state of Pennsylvania in November.",
      "Fetterman since has shown surprising warmth to Trump, complimenting his political appeal, agreeing with him on some policies and embracing some of Trump's would-be Cabinet nominees.",

      "Fetterman has been unafraid to be an outsider to his party in the past. He endorsed insurgent Democrat Bernie Sanders in 2016's presidential primary over Hillary Clinton and ran from the left against the party-backed candidate in 2016's Senate primary. When the state Democratic Party looked to endorse a candidate in 2022's three-way Democratic primary, Fetterman dismissed it as an \u201cinside game.\u201d",

      "He said the constant \u201cfreak-out\u201d by Democrats over Trump isn't helpful, he called Trump a \u201csingular political talent\" and he disavowed the label \u201cfascist\u201d that Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris had given Trump during the campaign.",

      "___",
      "Leaders of the clergy, distinguished guests and most importantly the Carter family.",
      "In April 2021, Jill and I visited Jimmy and Rosalynn on a warm spring day down in Plains, Georgia. We wanted to see them.",
      "Rosalynn met us at the front door with her signature smile. Together, we entered a home that they had shared for almost 77 years of marriage, an unassuming red brick ranch home. They flexed their modesty more than any trappings of power.",
      "We walked into the living room where Jimmy greeted us like family. That day, just the four of us sat in the living room and shared memories that spanned almost six decades, a deep friendship that started in 1974.",
      "I was a 31-year-old senator. And I was the first senator outside of Georgia, maybe the first senator, to endorse his candidacy for president.",
      "It was an endorsement based on what I believe is Jimmy Carter\u2019s enduring attribute: Character. Character. Character.",
      "Because of that, character, I believe, is destiny. Destiny in our lives and quite frankly, destiny in the life of the nation.",
      "It is an accumulation of a million things built on character that leads to a good life in a decent country. A life of purpose, a life of meaning. Now, how do we find that good life? What does it look like? What does it take to build character? Do the ends justify the means?",
      "Jimmy Carter\u2019s friendship taught me, and through his life taught me, that strength of character is more than title or the power we hold. It\u2019s the strength to understand that everyone should be treated with dignity, respect. That everyone, and I mean everyone, deserves an even shot. Not a guarantee, but just a shot.",
      "You know, we have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor. And to stand up to what my dad used to say is the greatest sin of all: the abuse of power.",
      "Now, it\u2019s not about being perfect, because none of us are perfect. We\u2019re all fallible. But it\u2019s about asking ourselves: Are we striving to do things, the right things? What values? What are the values that animate our spirit? To operate from fear or hope, ego or generosity? Do we show grace? Do we keep the faith when it\u2019s most tested?",
      "For keeping the faith with the best of humankind and the best of America is the story, in my view, from my perspective, of Jimmy Carter\u2019s life.",
      "The story of a man, to state the obvious \u2013 you\u2019ve heard today some great, great eulogies -- who came from a house without running water or electricity and rose to the pinnacle of power.",
      "The story of a man who was at once driven and devoted to making real the words of his savior and the ideals of this nation. The story of a man who never let the tides of politics divert him from his mission to serve and shape the world.",
      "The man had character.",
      "Jimmy held a deep Christian faith in God. And that his candidacy spoke and wrote about faith as a substance of things hoped for, and evidence of the things not seen. Faith founded on commandments of scripture. Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul. And love thy neighbor as thyself.",
      "Easy to say, but very, very difficult to do. In his life, in this life, any walk of faith can be difficult. It can be lonely. But it requires action to be the doers of the world.",
      "But in that commandment lies the essence, in my view, found in the gospel, found in many faith traditions, and found in the very idea of America. Because the very journey of our nation is a walk of sheer faith. To do the work, to be the country we say we are, to be the country we say we want to be. A nation where all are created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.",
      "We\u2019ve never fully lived up to that idea of America. We\u2019ve never walked away from it either, because of patriots like Jimmy Carter. Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works and a good and faithful servant of God and of the people.",
      "And today, many think he was from a bygone era. But in reality, he saw well into the future.",
      "A white Southern Baptist who led on civil rights. A decorated Navy veteran who brokered peace. A brilliant nuclear engineer who led on nuclear nonproliferation. A hard-working farmer who championed conservation and clean energy.",
      "And a president who redefined the relationship with a vice president.",
      "Jimmy and I often talked about our dear friend Walter Mondale, whom we all miss very much. Together they formed a model partnership of collaboration and trust, because both were men of character.",
      "And as we all know, Jimmy Carter also established a model post-presidency by making a powerful difference as a private citizen in America. And I might add, as you all know around the world, through it all he showed us how character and faith start with ourselves and then flow to others.",
      "At our best, we share the better parts of ourselves: joy, solidarity, love, commitment. Not for reward, but in reverence for the incredible gift of life we\u2019ve all been granted. To make every minute of our time here on Earth count.",
      "That\u2019s the definition of a good life, a life Jimmy Carter lived during his 100 years.",
      "To young people, to anyone in search of meaning and purpose, study the power of Jimmy Carter\u2019s example.",
      "I miss him, but I take solace in knowing that he and his beloved Rosalynn are reunited again. To the entire Carter family, thank you, and I mean this sincerely, for sharing them both with America and the world. We love you all.",
      "Jill and I will cherish our visits with them, including that last one in their home. We saw Jimmy as he always was, at peace with a life fully lived. A good life of purpose and meaning, of character driven by destiny and filled with the power of faith, hope and love.",
      "Say it again: Faith, hope and love.",
      "As he returns to Plains, Georgia, for his final resting place, we can say goodbye. In the words of the prophet Micah, who Jimmy so admired until his final breath, Jimmy Carter did justly, loved mercy, walked humbly.",
      "May God bless a great American, a dear friend and a good man. May he rise up, be raised up on eagle\u2019s wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.",
      "God bless you, Jimmy Carter."

      "As the cataclysmic wildfires rage across Los Angeles, President-elect Donald Trump isn't offering much sympathy",
      "WASHINGTON -- As cataclysmic wildfires rage across Los Angeles, President-elect Donald Trump hasn't been offering much sympathy. Instead, he's claiming he could do a better job managing the crisis, spewing falsehoods and casting blame on the state's Democratic governor.",
      "Trump has lashed out at his longtime political foe Gov. Gavin Newsom's forest management policies and falsely claimed the state's fish conservation efforts are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas. Referring to the governor by a derisive nickname, Trump said he should resign.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 180,000 people have been under evacuation orders and the fires have consumed more than 45 square miles (116 square kilometers). One that destroyed the neighborhood of Pacific Palisades became the most destructive blaze in Los Angeles history.",
      "Trump v. Newsom: Round 2 was to be expected \u2014 the liberal Democrat has long been one of Trump\u2019s biggest foils. But the Western fires are also a sign of something far more grave than a political spat or a fight over fish. Wildfire season is growing ever longer thanks to increasing drought and heat brought on by climate change.",
      "Trump refuses to recognize the environmental dangers, instead blaming increasing natural disasters on his political opponents or on acts of God. He has promised to drill for more oil and cut back on renewable energy.",
      "On Thursday, Trump said on social media that Newsom should \u201copen up the water main\u201d \u2014 an overly simplistic solution to a complex problem. \u201cNO MORE EXCUSES FROM THIS INCOMPETENT GOVERNOR,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cIT\u2019S ALREADY FAR TOO LATE!\u201d",
      "Standing on the street in a scorched subdivision as a home behind him was engulfed in flames, Newsom responded to the criticism when asked about it by CNN.",
      "\u201cPeople are literally fleeing. People have lost their lives. Kids lost their schools. Families completely torn asunder. Churches burned down, and this guy wants to politicize it,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI have a lot of thoughts and I know what I want to say, but I won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In a post on his Truth Social media network, Trump tried to connect dry hydrants to criticism of the state\u2019s approach to balancing the distribution of water to farms and cities with the need to protect endangered species including the Delta smelt. Trump has sided with farmers over environmentalists in a long-running dispute over California\u2019s scarce water resources. But that debate has nothing to do with the hydrant issue in Los Angeles, driven by an intense demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes.",
      "About 40% of Los Angeles city water comes from state-controlled projects connected to northern California and the state has limited the water it delivers this year. But the southern California reservoirs these canals help feed are at above-average levels for this time of year.",
      "Roughly 20% of hydrants across the city went dry as crews battled blazes, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. Firefighters in Southern California are accustomed to dealing with the strong Santa Ana winds that blow in the fall and winter, but the hurricane-force gusts earlier in the week took them by surprise. The winds grounded firefighting aircraft that should have been making critical water drops, straining the hydrant system.",
      "\u201cThis is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in my 25 years on the fire department,\u201d Los Angeles Fire Capt. Adam VanGerpen told CBS This Morning.",
      "Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said the ferocity of the fire made the demand for water four times greater than \u201cwe\u2019ve ever seen in the system.\u201d",
      "Hydrants are designed for fighting fires at one or two houses at a time, not hundreds, Qui\u00f1ones said, and refilling the tanks also requires asking fire departments to pause firefighting efforts.",
      "President Joe Biden, who was in California for an environmental event that ended up being canceled as the fires raged, appeared with Newsom at a Santa Monica firehouse on Wednesday and quickly issued a major disaster declaration for California, releasing some immediate federal funds.",
      "But any additional federal response will be overseen by Trump, who has a history of withholding or delaying federal aid to punish his political enemies.",
      "In September, during a press conference at his Los Angeles golf course, Trump threatened: \"We won\u2019t give him money to put out all his fires. And if we don\u2019t give him the money to put out his fires, he\u2019s got problems.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s support in California has increased in recent years, which could further embolden him in his tussles with Democratic leaders there. In 2024, he improved on his vote share in Los Angeles and surrounding areas hit by the fires by 4.68 percentage points. And while he still lost the state overall, he grew his overall margin by 4 points compared to the 2020 election.",
      "As for the impact of the fires on Californians, Trump said areas in Beverly Hills and around it were \u201cbeing decimated\u201d and that he had \"many friends living in those houses.\u201d He framed the losses as a potential hit to the state's finances.",
      "\u201cThe biggest homes, some of the most valuable homes in the world are just destroyed. I don\u2019t even know. You talk about a tax base, if those people leave you\u2019re going to lose half your tax base of California,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Michael Rivas, 19, of Miami, was one of six men arrested after a series of events in Danbury on Aug. 25. He pleaded guilty to kidnapping and conspiracy charges in federal court in Hartford. Two others are expected to enter similar pleas in the same court on Friday.",
      "The couple were driving in a new Lamborghini SUV when the suspects forced them out of the SUV, assaulted them, put them in a van and bound them, police said. Witnesses immediately alerted police. Four of the men were arrested after abandoning their vehicles including the van and fleeing on foot, while the other two were later taken into custody at a nearby home the group had rented through Airbnb, authorities said. The couple were injured but survived the ordeal.",

      "His lawyer, Brian Woolf, said Rivas accepted a co-defendant\u2019s invitation to take part in the plot with the hope of getting a share of the ransom money, and he regrets that decision.",

      "But federal agents told Danbury police that the FBI was looking into whether the couple's son was involved in the Bitcoin theft, Danbury Detective Sgt. Steven Castrovinci told The Associated Press. Neither Danbury police nor federal authorities have named the couple or their son.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Ross Weingarten declined to comment after Thursday's court hearing.",
      "In mid-September, federal prosecutors announced that the two men, Malone Lam, 20, and Jeandiel Serrano, 21, had been indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in connection with the cryptocurrency theft.",
      "Court documents say unnamed coconspirators were in on the scam with the two men. Their lawyers have not responded to requests for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said in court documents that Lam, Serrano and the unnamed coconspirators posed as technical support staff for Google and a cryptocurrency exchange while contacting the victim of the theft with an offer to help him with a supposed security breach.",
      "The victim, from Washington, D.C., believed them and gave them remote access to his computer on Aug. 18. That resulted in the alleged thieves making off with more than 4,100 Bitcoin, then valued at more than $240 million, prosecutors said. That amount of Bitcoin is now worth nearly $380 million.",
      "According to prosecutors, Serrano, of Los Angeles, admitted during an interview with federal investigators that he used the stolen currency to buy three automobiles, worth more than $1 million in total, as well as a $500,000 watch. He also said he had about $20 million of the victim\u2019s currency and agreed to transfer the funds to the FBI, authorities said.",
      "Meanwhile Lam, a citizen of Singapore who had addresses in Los Angeles and Miami, Florida, was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a night at Los Angeles night clubs and acquiring custom Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Porsches, prosecutors said. He also was renting two Miami mansions, bought a $2 million watch and had a Lamborghini Revuelto worth more than $1 million.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in court documents that at least $100 million of the stolen funds remained missing.",
      "Exactly a week after the crypto theft, the couple from Danbury, a city of more than 80,000 people along the New York border, were forced out of their SUV in their hometown after one of the carjackers\u2019 vehicles rear-ended them and two other vehicles surrounded them. The group assaulted the man with a baseball bat and dragged the woman by her hair as they put them in the van, where the couple were bound with duct tape, police said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply remorseful for my irresponsible behavior,\u201d Rivas told U.S. District Judge Sarala Nagala on Thursday. \u201cI should have known better.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not what my parents taught me growing up,\u201d he added.",
      "Rivas and the other five men also are facing kidnapping and assault charges in Connecticut state court. The other men are also from Florida.",
      "Sentencing was set for May 13. The prosecution and defense agreed on sentencing guidelines that call for about 11 to 14 years in prison."

      "Six people who were injured and the father of a man who was killed in the New Year's truck attack filed a lawsuit Thursday against the City of New Orleans and two contractors, claiming they failed to protect revelers from an Army veteran who sped around a police blockade and raced down Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring at least 30.",
      "The attack by Shamsud-Din Jabbar was tragic but preventable, leaving the six victims with broken bones, physical suffering and mental anguish and killing Brandon Taylor, according to the lawsuit filed in Orleans Parish Civil District Court by Matthew Hemmer with the Morris Bart Law Firm. Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police.",
      "The plaintiffs, who are seeking unspecified damages, include Alexis Windham, who suffered impact and gunshot injuries to her foot, and Corian Evans, Jalen Lilly, Justin Brown, Shara Frison and Gregory Townsend, who suffered broken bones and other injuries. They were joined by Brandon Taylor's father, Joseph. Windham, Evans, Lilly and Brown are from Alabama while Frison and Townsend are from Missouri.",
      "Taylor, 43, worked as a restaurant cook in the New Orleans area and loved music, especially rap. He leaves behind his fiancee, who was with him when he was killed, and his father.",
      "Email and phone messages left with the City of New Orleans, Mayor LaToya Cantrell, and contractors Mott MacDonald and Hard Rock Construction seeking comment on the lawsuit were not immediately returned.",
      "Incidents of vehicles driving into crowds started increasing after 2016, when 86 people were killed on Bastille Day in Nice, France, the lawsuit said. New Orleans sought advice on the risk of this type of attack in the French Quarter and invested $40 million in public safety improvement projects, including acquiring portable bollards \u2014 protective columns designed to block vehicle traffic \u2014to keep cars off Bourbon Street.",
      "However, the bollards were often disabled when the tracks they move on got clogged with beads, drink containers, rainwater and other fluids, the lawsuit said. A 2019 report by New York firm Interfor International said the French Quarter was at risk for a vehicular attack, adding \u201cthe current bollard system on Bourbon Street does not appear to work\" and should be fixed immediately.",
      "An April 2024 report by Mott MacDonald, a design firm hired for roadway projects, included the possibility of a Ford F-150 truck turning on to Bourbon Street, which is what happened on New Year's Day, but the company's bollard replacement project did not include fixed bollards in the French Quarter, the lawsuit said.",
      "Construction on the safety updates began in November, but work on Canal Street didn't begin until Dec. 19 and construction was ongoing on Jan. 1, when the attack occurred, the suit said. Authorities have said Jabbar drove an F-150 pickup truck onto a sidewalk around a police car blockading the Canal Street entrance to Bourbon Street.",
      "\u201cAppropriate barriers, temporary or otherwise, were not erected in the construction site,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cAs a result, the intersection had the appearance of a soft target. Upon initial penetration, Mr. Jabbar was able to travel approximately three blocks down Bourbon Street.\u201d",
      "The contractors and the city failed to implement an effective system for deterring such a threat, the suit said.",
      "Two other law firms announced Wednesda y that they represent nearly two dozen victims of the attack and are conducting their own investigation, stating \u201cofficials were tragically aware and did not protect the public.\u201d"

    "summary": "Tennessee's Department of Correction has released a redacted version of its newly completed execution manual after initially refusing to do so",
    "story": [
      "Tennessee's Department of Correction has released a redacted version of its newly completed execution manual after initially refusing to do so",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee on Thursday released a redacted version of its newly completed execution manual, blacking out sporadic titles and team names throughout the notably trimmed-down document that now provides vague guidelines and omits previously detailed steps on carrying out the death penalty.",
      "The Tennessee Department of Correction initially refused to hand over the manual when pressed by The Associated Press, arguing that the state had to keep the entire manual secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people involved.",
      "However, on Thursday, the agency abruptly reversed course and provided the AP with a copy of the lethal injection protocol. Their only explanation for the change was that the state was revising its decision.",
      "The 44-page manual is noticeably shorter than the 2018 version the state had been operating under, which contained nearly 100 pages, including 11 pages detailing how lethal injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. The state's failure to follow those procedures forced Republican Gov. Bill Lee in 2022 to call a last-minute halt to the execution of inmate Oscar Smith and then place a moratorium on new executions while the process was under review.",
      "An independent report later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed since 2018 had been fully tested as required by the manual. Later, the state Attorney General\u2019s Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for overseeing Tennessee\u2019s lethal injection drugs \u201cincorrectly testified\u201d under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required.",
      "The new manual contains only a single page on the lethal injection chemicals with no specific directions for testing the drugs. It also removes a requirement that the drugs come from a licensed pharmacist. Yet the new protocol does include several new additions, including now authorizing the state to deviate from the protocol whenever the Correction Department commissioner deems it necessary.",
      "In Tennessee, the 2018 lethal injection protocol required a series of three drugs administered in sequence. The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of pentobarbital. One other change \u2014 the people most responsible for carrying out the execution will now be outside contractors. The manual requires an IV team of at least two people and a physician who are not Tennessee Department of Correction personnel.",
      "When ordering the pause in 2022, Lee stressed that it was his administration's duty to \u201censure continued transparency\u201d for Tennesseans surrounding the death penalty and that he expected \"the Tennessee Department of Correction to leave no question that procedures are correctly followed.\u201d",
      "Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender\u2019s habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee\u2019s death row inmates, told the AP in an email that the new manual \u201cfails to address the many concerns raised by the independent investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs of today, we still do not know the source of drugs, whether they are compounded, or whether they have been diverted from the market into a gray market, how they will be procured, stored, tested, and administered,\" she said. \"This level of secrecy is inconsistent with the promises of transparency made by the Governor two years ago.\u201d",
      "Across the U.S., executions have remained at historic lows for years, but the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections.",
      "Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide information about the qualifications of their execution teams. Meanwhile, some courts have dismissed states' claim that more public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials over a lack of evidence."

      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she will push for new laws to make it harder for hedge funds to purchase large numbers of single-family homes in the state",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday said she will push for new laws to make it harder for hedge funds to purchase large numbers of single-family homes in the state.",
      "In a statement, Hochul said she would propose legislation this year that would require a 75 day waiting period before large investment firms could place bids on new homes hitting the market and limit certain tax benefits when the firms purchase homes.",
      "The plan comes as lawmakers elsewhere have also sought to address public concerns that hedge funds or other big investors are buying up single-family homes and shrinking the housing supply for individual buyers and families. Experts have blamed housing scarcity on several factors, including high mortgage rates and years of underbuilding of new homes.",
      "Hochul, in her statement, said \u201cshadowy private equity giants are buying up the housing supply in communities across New York, leaving everyday homebuyers with fewer and fewer affordable options.\u201d",
      "Private equity firms own more than 500,000 homes nationwide, according to the governor's news release, with some estimates expecting the firms to own up to 40% of the single-family rental market by 2030. There were more than 145 million housing units in the country in 2023, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "A report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies found that non-individual investors \u2014 which includes landlords who form limited liability corporations \u2014 owned a quarter of single-family rentals in 2021. Larger investors tended to buy newer and bigger homes in places with population growth and rapid rent increases, according to the report.",
      "A different report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the country's five largest institutional investors owned nearly 2% of all single-family rental homes nationally in 2022, which amounted to about 300,000 homes.",
      "Hochul, a Democrat, has rolled out a series of economic proposals for the state's legislative session that are geared toward addressing the state's high cost of living. On Thursday, she also announced proposals to incentivize the construction of starter homes and help first-time homeowners with down payments.",

      "Five current and former U.S. presidents have come together for Jimmy Carter\u2019s funeral",
      "WASHINGTON -- As they filed into the front pews at Washington National Cathedral, wearing dark suits and mostly solemn faces, five current and former presidents came together for Jimmy Carter's funeral. For a service that stretched more than an hour, the feuding, grievances and enmity that had marked their rival campaigns and divergent politics gave way to a reverential moment for one of their own.",
      "Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the first two of the group to take their seats Thursday, shook hands and chatted at length. Trump, the former president who will retake the Oval Office in 11 days, leaned in and listened intently to his predecessor, notwithstanding the political chasm between them. At times, the two flashed smiles.",
      "Obama, who attended without his wife, Michelle, shared a second-row pew with former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrived last and sat in the pew just in front of them.",
      "Members of the exclusive presidents' club were on their best behavior. Bonded by the presidency, they rarely criticize one another or the White House\u2019s current occupant \u2014 though Trump has flouted those rules frequently. He has both praised and criticized Carter in recent days, and he complained that flags will still be at half-staff to honor the deceased president during his inauguration.",
      "In one seemingly chilly moment, Trump looked up when Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 whom he defeated in November's hard-fought election \u2014 entered the cathedral, but he didn't move to greet her as she and husband Doug Emhoff took seats directly in front of him and Melania Trump. Nor did Harris acknowledge him.",
      "After the service, Emhoff made a point to turn around and shake hands with Trump.",
      "Obama, with Trump on his left, also turned to his right to chat with Bush. Clinton, with wife Hillary, was the last of the ex-presidents to take a seat and got in some chatter with Bush as well.",
      "The White House said the former presidents also met privately before taking their seats.",
      "Funerals are among the few events that bring members of the presidents' club together. In a way, former President Gerald Ford was there, too: Ford's son Steven read a eulogy for Carter that Ford had written before he died in 2006.",
      "Busy with personal pursuits, charitable endeavors and sometimes lucrative speaking gigs, the former leaders don\u2019t mingle often. They all know the protocol of state funerals well \u2014 each has been involved in planning his own.",
      "During the 2018 funeral for George H.W. Bush, then-President Trump sat with his predecessors and their spouses, including the Carters, and the interactions were stiff and sometimes awkward.",
      "This time, Trump also didn't appear to interact with Hillary Clinton, whom he defeated in the 2016 election.",
      "Trump was seated in the pew in front of his former vice president, Mike Pence \u2014 one of the few times they have coincided at events since Pence refused to overturn the results of the 2020 election after Trump lost to Biden. The two shook hands but didn't speak much beyond that. Pence's wife, Karen, appeared to avoid engaging with the president-elect.",
      "Trump, who largely avoided contact with the former presidents during his first term \u2014 and pointedly did not seek their advice \u2014 has been critical of Republican former presidents, particularly the Bush family, which made him an uneasy member of the former presidents' club. Carter himself didn't particularly relish being a member of the club, at times criticizing its staid traditions.",
      "Many past presidents have built relationships with their predecessors, including Bill Clinton, who reached out to Richard Nixon for advice on Russian policy, and Harry S. Truman, who sought counsel from Herbert Hoover.",
      "One of the first calls Obama made after U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 was to George W. Bush to spread the word that the mission had been accomplished, said Kate Andersen Brower, author of \u201cTeam of Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's the loneliest job in the world, so usually they reach out and rely on each other,\" said Andersen Brower. \"But Trump didn't have that the first term, so this will just be another four years where he doesn't depend on anyone who came before him.\"",
      "She noted that Carter spent years as a proud Washington outsider and skipped the unveiling of his own portrait to avoid being in the same room with the man who beat him in 1980, President Ronald Reagan.",
      "\u201cCarter and Trump, even though they have the least in common about everything else, are similar,\" Andersen Brower said, \"in just how they approach telling what they actually think.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration\u2019s Title IX rules expanding protections for LGBTQ+ students have been struck down nationwide after a federal judge in Kentucky found they overstepped the president\u2019s authority.",
      "In a decision issued Thursday, U.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves scrapped the entire 1,500-page regulation after deciding it was \u201cfatally\u201d tainted by legal shortcomings. The rule had already been halted in 26 states after a wave of legal challenges by Republican states.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump previously promised to end the rules \u201con day one\u201d and made anti-transgender themes a centerpiece of his campaign.",
      "The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia.",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti called it a rejection of the Biden administration's \u201crelentless push to impose a radical gender ideology.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause the Biden rule is vacated altogether, President Trump will be free to take a fresh look at our Title IX regulations when he returns to office,\u201d Skrmetti said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately comment on the decision.",
      "The Biden administration ignited controversy when it finalized the new rules last year. The regulation expanded Title IX, a 1972 law forbidding discrimination based on sex in education, to also prevent discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. It also widened the definition of harassment to include a broader range of misconduct.",
      "Civil rights advocates hailed it as a victory, saying it gave LGBTQ+ students new recourse against discrimination. But it drew outrage from conservatives who said it could be used to protect transgender athletes in girls' sports.",
      "The rule didn't explicitly address athletics and mostly detailed how schools and colleges were required to respond to cases of discrimination and sexual assault. A separate proposal dealing with transgender athletes in sports was put on the back-burner and later revoked after it became a focal point of Trump\u2019s campaign.",
      "In his decision, Reeves found the Education Department overstepped its authority by expanding the scope of Title IX.",
      "There\u2019s nothing in the 1972 law suggesting that it should cover any more than it has since Congress created it, Reeves wrote. He called it an \u201cattempt to bypass the legislative process and completely transform Title IX.\u201d",
      "The judge also found that it violated free speech rights by requiring teachers to use pronouns aligning with a student\u2019s gender identity.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment does not permit the government to chill speech or compel affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees in this manner,\u201d Reeves wrote.",
      "Rather than carve out certain aspects of the rule, Reeves decided it was best to toss the regulation in its entirety and revert to a previous interpretation of Title IX. He said his decision will \u201csimply \u2018cause a return to the status quo\u2019 that existed for more than 50 years prior to its effective date.\u201d",
      "Among the biggest critics of the rule was Betsy DeVos, former education secretary during Trump's first term. On the social media site X, she wrote that the \u201cradical, unfair, illegal, and absurd Biden Title IX re-write is GONE.\u201d",
      "Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said Biden's rule \u201cbetrayed the original intent of Title IX by removing longstanding protections that ensured fairness for women and girls.\u201d",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A group studying where to put South Carolina\u2019s first Statehouse monument to an individual African American has decided Robert Smalls\u2019 statue should be staring down a notorious white supremacist who dismantled most of the former slave's work after the Civil War.",
      "The Smalls statue would stand along the sidewalk where thousands of children on field trips walk from buses to the Statehouse each spring. Backers hope that will spur conversations about a man who lived a heroically full life.",
      "Born into bondage, Smalls stole a Confederate ship during the Civil War to sail his family and a dozen others to freedom. He spent a decade in the U.S. House, helped rewrite South Carolina\u2019s constitution to allow Black men equality after the Civil War and then put up a valiant but doomed fight when racists returned to power and eliminated nearly all of the gains Smalls fought for.",

      "After the vote, the sponsor of the bill creating the committee, white Republican Rep. Brandon Cox, and one of its first and most ardent backers, Black Democratic Rep. Jermaine Johnson, walked to the proposed site of the statue. They spoke a few minutes to reporters and then were suddenly overcome by emotion and hugged each other tight.",

      "Robert Smalls was born in 1839 in Beaufort, South Carolina, and died in 1915 in his hometown a free, but somewhat forgotten man tossed aside by a Southern society determined to keep Blacks inferior.",
      "But Smalls' story was too bold and amazing to fade away.",
      "In May 1862, during the Civil War, the steel-nerved ship pilot waited for the ship's white Confederate crew members to leave the vessel for an evening out. Smalls then donned a Confederate uniform, hat pulled low over his dark brow. He mimicked hand signals and whistle toots to get through Confederate checkpoints in the pale moonlight before surrendering the ship to nearby Union soldiers, having secured his family's freedom and that of the other enslaved people on board.",
      "Smalls helped the Union for the rest of the Civil War. After the South lost, Smalls went on to serve in the South Carolina House and Senate before being elected to the U.S. House. He bought his master\u2019s house in Beaufort in part with money made from turning the Confederate ship over to Union forces, then allowed the man\u2019s penniless wife to live there when she was widowed.",
      "Smalls would see a new South Carolina constitution in 1895 wipe out African Americans\u2019 right to vote in a convention led by \u201cPitchfork\u201d Ben Tillman.",
      "Tillman was a governor and U.S. senator who bragged about leading groups of white people who killed Black men who had been trying to vote during the 1876 election, which led to the end of Reconstruction, the return of all-white rule and the collapse of everything for which Smalls had worked.",
      "Smalls' statue, if approved, will face Tillman's direction, staring him down from about a football field away.",
      "Some civil rights groups have called for tearing down statues of Confederates and white supremacists like Tillman, but state law requires legislative approval to remove them or even add language to the monuments detailing their racist deeds, which has been an impossible task in a state dominated by conservative Republicans.",
      "Sculptor Basil Watson's proposal is Smalls dressed in a tuxedo as a congressman at the height of his power. It was chosen over an idea that included multiple versions of Smalls as a riverboat captain and lawmaker.",
      "A statue of one person at the height of power matches the motif of other Statehouse statues honoring men including segregationist U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, Confederate general and former Gov. Wade Hampton and President George Washington, who will also be in the sightline of the Smalls statue, said Mike Shealy, the chairman of the Robert Smalls Monument Commission.",
      "\u201cThe simplicity of the statue of one man on a pedestal who is equal to the other people who are memorialized on our Statehouse grounds is the best depiction,\u201d Shealy said.",
      "A design also allows officials to begin raising money. Cox and Johnson believe it will cost millions to do it right. The more money raised, the taller the statue and the more intricate the design.",
      "\u201cHeck, I'd put a 24-carat gold statue up if we could raise $100 million,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "On one side of the statue's base will be facts about Smalls' life. On another will be a quote from Smalls from 1895 when Tillman and other whites took over the state constitutional convention and tried to put Smalls and other African Americans back in their place.",
      "\u201cMy race needs no special defense, for the past history of them in this country proves them to be the equal of any people anywhere. All they need is an equal chance in the battle of life,\" Smalls said."

      "WASHINGTON -- Jason Carter, the former president\u2019s grandson who now chairs The Carter Center governing board, memorialized his grandfather with blend of personal touches and humor, recognition of Jimmy Carter's intensity and ambition, and his determination to help people whether through politics or out of office.",
      "The younger Carter painted the 39th president as a regular \u201cPawPaw\u201d from a \u201ctiny village\u201d who was able to connect with marginalized people across the world.",
      "Here is a transcript of his remarks at a state funeral for Jimmy Carter:",
      "In my church, we sing a song that says, \u201cFrom the moment that I wake up until I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God.\u201d",
      "I don\u2019t know how many people in here can say that. I know I can\u2019t. But my grandfather certainly can. From the moment that he woke up until he laid his head, his life was a testament to the goodness of God.",
      "And I thank all of you for being here to celebrate this life.",
      "To the presidents and first ladies: It is a great honor to have you here. You know the human side of the American presidency like no others. And we appreciate you.",
      "To the vice presidents, other distinguished guests and friends of all kinds: Thank you for being here.",
      "To those of you who came from all across the world: Thank you for being here to celebrate and pay tribute to my grandfather.",
      "I say grandfather, but we call him PawPaw, as many of you know. And we called my grandmother Mom Carter. So we spent our time talking about Mom and PawPaw and mostly, speaking of the human side of the presidency, just letting people know that they were regular folks.",
      "Yes, they spent four years in the governor\u2019s mansion and four years at the White House. But the other 92 years they spent at home in Plains, Georgia. And one of the best ways to demonstrate that they were regular folks is to take them by that home.",
      "First of all, it looks like they might have built it themselves. Second of all, my grandfather was likely to show up at the door in some \u201970s short shorts and Crocs.",
      "And then you\u2019d walk in the house and it was like thousands of other grandparents\u2019 house(s) all across the South. Fishing trophies on the walls. The refrigerator, of course, was papered with pictures of grandchildren and then great grandchildren. Their main phone, of course, had a cord and was stuck to the wall in the kitchen like a museum piece. And demonstrating their Depression-era roots, they had a little rack next to the sink where they would hang Ziploc bags to dry.",
      "And demonstrating that they changed with the times, eventually he did get a cellphone. And one time he called me sort of early on in that process, and on my phone it said, \u201cPawPaw mobile.\u201d So I answered it of course.",
      "I said, \u201cHey, PawPaw.\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d",
      "I said, \u201cThis is Jason!\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d",
      "I said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything. You called me!\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t call you. I\u2019m taking a picture.\u201d",
      "A nuclear engineer, right? I mean.",
      "They were small-town people who never forgot who they were and where they were from, no matter what happened in their lives. But I recognize that we are not here because he was just a regular guy.",
      "As you heard from the other speakers, his political life and his presidency, for me, was not just ahead of its time. It was prophetic.",
      "He had the courage and strength to stick to his principles even when they were politically unpopular. As governor of Georgia half a century ago, he preached an end to racial discrimination and an end to mass incarceration. As president in the 1970s, as you\u2019ve heard, he protected more land than any other president in history.",
      "Fifty years ago he was a climate warrior who pushed for a world where we conserved energy, limited emissions and traded our reliance on fossil fuels for expanded renewable sources.",

      "Maybe this is unbelievable to you, but in my 49 years, I never perceived a difference between his public face and his private one. He was the same person, no matter who he was with or where he was. And for me, that\u2019s the definition of integrity.",
      "That honesty was matched by love. It was matched by faith. And in both public and private, my grandparents did fundamentally live their lives in effort, as the Bible says, to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with their God.",
      "Sometimes I feel and felt like I shared my grandfather with the world. Today is one of those days. But really, he shared the world with me. The power of an atom. The beauty and complexity of a south Georgia forest. When we fished, he celebrated the majesty of everything from the smallest minnow to that grand circulation of waters. And he shared this love with my boys, taking these Atlanta public school kids out into the fields to show them about row crops and wild plums.",
      "In the end, his life is a love story. And of course, it\u2019s a love story about Jimmy and Rosalynn and their 77 years of marriage and service. As the song says, they were the flagship of the fleet. And rest assured that in these last weeks, he told us that he was ready to see her again.",
      "But his life was also a broader love story about love for his fellow humans, and about living out the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself. I believe that that love is what taught him and told him to preach the power of human rights, not just for some people, but for all people. It focused him on the power and the promise of democracy, its love for freedom, its requirement and founding belief in the wisdom of regular people raising their voices and the requirement that you respect all of those voices, not just some.",
      "That conviction made him a naval officer who believed and demonstrated, as you\u2019ve heard, that the greatest power of America was not the military, but its values. Those values were personal to him, and he lived them both publicly and privately. As you heard (former Carter White House aide) Stu (Eizenstat) say, as president, he gave voice to dissidents, stood up to dictators, brought countries together in peace.",
      "His heart broke for the people of Israel. It broke for the people of Palestine. And he spent his life trying to bring peace to that holy land. And he talked about it at the dinner table. It was the same in public as it was in private. And for the last 40 years, as you\u2019ve heard, he spent his time living out that love and that faith alongside the poorest and most marginalized people in the world. And that work, again, has been based fundamentally on love and respect.",
      "The Carter Center has 3,500 employees, but only a couple hundred in the United States. The rest are spread throughout the countries where we work. Ethiopia, South Sudan, Chad, Bangladesh. And all of the Carter Center\u2019s programs are based on a respect, that same respect for the power of regular people, even if they are in tiny villages miles from anywhere else.",
      "To give one example, we\u2019ve all heard a lot lately about guinea worm disease. It\u2019s an ancient and debilitating disease of poverty, and that disease will have existed from the dawn of humanity until Jimmy Carter. When he started working on this disease there were 3.5 million cases in humans every year. Last year, there were 14.",
      "And the thing that\u2019s remarkable is that this disease is not eliminated with medicine. It\u2019s eliminated essentially by neighbors talking to neighbors about how to collect water in the poorest and most marginalized villages in the world. And those neighbors truly were my grandfather\u2019s partners for the last 40 years.",
      "And as this disease has been eliminated in every village in Nigeria, every village in Sudan or Uganda, what\u2019s left behind in those tiny 600-person villages is an army of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carters who have demonstrated their own power to change their world.",
      "And that is a fundamental truth about my grandfather. It begins where it ends. When he saw a tiny 600-person village that everybody else thinks of as poor, he recognized it. That\u2019s where he was from. That\u2019s who he was. And he never saw it as a place to send pity. It was always a place to find partnership and power, and a place to carry out that commandment to love your neighbor as yourself.",
      "Essentially, he eradicated a disease with love and respect.",
      "He waged peace with love and respect.",
      "He led this nation with love and respect.",
      "To me, this life was a love story from the moment that he woke up, until he laid his head.",
      "I\u2019ll conclude with this. As Andy Young (a civil rights leader, former Atlanta mayor and Carter's ambassador to the United Nations) told me, he may be gone, but he\u2019s not gone far.",
      "The outpouring of love and support that we have felt from you and from around the world has showed how many lives he has touched and how his spirit will live on in many ways.",
      "For us, he\u2019ll be in the kitchen making pancakes. Or in his woodshop finishing a cradle for a great-grandchild. Standing in a trout stream with Mom Carter. Or for me, just walking those Georgia fields and forests where he\u2019s from.",
      "Thank you."

      "Inside Washington National Cathedral, the five men who've occupied the Oval Office since 1993 convened for a rare moment together at Jimmy Carter\u2019s state funeral",
      "Look at their faces \u2014 formal, etched with experience, laden with the weight of momentous decisions. Add up their years: 379 to be exact, enough time to take you back into the mid-1600s, when the notion of the American nation was still more than a century away.",
      "Consider why they were there: to bid farewell to a member of their fraternity who was the last of his generation and whose own life began just a few years after World War I's ashes stopped smoldering.",
      "Bill Clinton. George W. Bush. Barack Obama. Donald Trump. Joe Biden.",
      "Inside Washington National Cathedral on Thursday, the five men who have occupied the Oval Office since 1993 convened for a rare moment together at Jimmy Carter's state funeral. In that one act, they created a momentary timeline of American history, a strand that connects them to the Roosevelts, to Lincoln and to Washington, the first of them. Visible right next to the five, too, were three people who were a heartbeat away from the same position \u2014 Al Gore, Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, the current vice president.",
      "The three coequal branches of the American government were designed to transcend just one person. Yet somehow, with our love of big personalities and our elevation of the individual, the president of the United States became a different breed entirely \u2014 an amalgam of person and office that now occupies a space in the culture like no other.",
      "The American presidency is draped in ritual. \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d is played when a president enters an official event. People stand when a president comes into the room. A protective cocoon envelopes a president\u2019s every move. Speeches are given behind a presidential seal. The office confers an aura that continues up until the moment of an elaborate, dayslong memorial.",
      "That aura \u2014 and the fact that many have hardly been ideological kindred spirits \u2014 is what makes images like those at Carter's service so extraordinary.",
      "Yet it's not merely that these are the fellow citizens who led Americans through the Kosovo war, through the aftermath of 9/11 and the Iraq War, through the rise of the internet and economic calamities, climate change and pandemic. It's not that, adore them or despise them, they rose to the lead the nation and did consequential things \u2014 positive and negative \u2014 in Americans' name.",
      "It's the precise opposite, actually.",
      "To see these men of history shoulder to shoulder in cathedral pews shows that they're human like all of us, and on this day of mourning, they dressed up for a funeral and said farewell to a touchstone of an earlier generation, in a display of unity and continuity. To view them in a single snapshot where no one \u2014 not even the sitting president \u2014 was in charge of the proceedings serves to humanize them. It reinforces the notion that Abraham Lincoln spoke of so many years ago \u2014 \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe power of regular people,\u201d Carter's grandson, Jason Carter, said in his eulogy.",
      "In a country where political money is unfathomable in its amounts and its power, this isn't to say these five men are \u201cregular people.\u201d The power they commanded, command or will command astonishes.",
      "But their power is ultimately limited, and not just by checks and balances. Whatever history thinks in the end of Biden, Trump, Obama, Bush and Clinton, it will always have the last word for the five who gathered Thursday \u2014 and the sixth, Carter, for whom they gathered.",
      "Stuart Eizenstat, a longtime Carter friend and adviser, had this to say about the 39th president at the service, but it probably works for all the commanders in chief in attendance: \u201cHe may not be a candidate for Mount Rushmore, but he belongs in the foothills.\"",

      "Kentucky's attorney general says the state will receive $110 million to settle its lawsuit accusing one of the nation's largest grocery chains of helping fuel the opioid epidemic",
      "Kentucky will receive $110 million to settle its lawsuit accusing one of the nation\u2019s largest grocery chains of helping fuel the opioid epidemic, the state's attorney general said Thursday.",
      "The state will use the money it is getting in its settlement with The Kroger Co. to combat an addiction that has ravaged communities and given the state some of the nation\u2019s highest overdose death rates.",
      "\u201cThis massive grocery chain that asked for our trust and our business allowed the fire of addiction to spread across the commonwealth, leaving pain and leaving so much brokenness in its aftermath,\u201d Attorney General Russell Coleman said in announcing the settlement.",
      "With Kentucky putting the settlement money toward prevention and recovery efforts, the company has \"agreed to become part of the solution,\u201d the Republican attorney general added.",
      "Kroger, a leading grocery chain in Kentucky, didn't immediately respond to a Thursday email seeking comment.",
      "Coleman's office sued Ohio-based Kroger last February, claiming its pharmacies helped fuel the opioid crisis. The suit, filed in state court, alleged that Kroger accumulated about 444 million doses of opioids to distribute in Kentucky between 2006 and 2019, amounting to 11% of all opioid pills sold in the state during that time.",
      "\u201cBut most shockingly, there was ... no internal, serious system in place at Kroger to track or report suspicious activities,\u201d the attorney general said. \"No trainings for staff. No guidelines to prevent abuse.\"",
      "Thousands of state and local governments across the country have sued drugmakers, distribution companies, pharmacies and others over the toll of the opioid epidemic.",
      "The lawsuits assert that the companies promoted drugs as nonaddictive and didn\u2019t exert enough control as they were shipped. At their peak during the coronavirus pandemic, the class of drugs was linked to more than 80,000 U.S. deaths per year. By then, the biggest killer was illicit fentanyl laced into many illegal drugs, rather than pills.",
      "Drug overdose deaths in Kentucky fell by nearly 10% in 2023, marking a second straight annual decline. But the fight against addiction is far from over, state leaders say, attributing the progress to a comprehensive response that includes treatment and prevention as well as illegal drug seizures by law enforcement. Even though the death toll declined, nearly 2,000 Kentuckians died from drug overdoses in 2023.",
      "Kroger agreed in 2023 to settle other lawsuits over the U.S. opioid crisis. As part of that deal, it agreed to pay up to $1.2 billion to state and local governments. Kentucky chose not to participate in the multistate legal action and that strategy paid off, Coleman said.",
      "\u201cIf we would have joined the multistate settlement ... Kentucky would have brought home close to $50 million,\u201d Coleman said, less than half the amount the state is receiving from its own lawsuit.",
      "Meanwhile, government lawsuits against pharmacy benefit managers are seen as the latest frontier \u2014 and maybe the last big one \u2014 in years of litigation over the opioid-related drug epidemic in the U.S. Coleman has sued pharmacy benefit managers OptumRx and Express Scripts.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers run prescription drug coverage for health insurers and employers that provide coverage. They help decide which drugs make a plan\u2019s formulary, or list of covered medications. They also can determine where patients go to fill their prescriptions.",
      "A series of Kentucky attorneys general from both political parties \u2014 including now-Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat \u2014 aggressively pursued legal action against companies that make or distribute opioid-based medication.",
      "In the Kroger settlement, about $16 million will cover lawyers' fees and costs, based on state law and terms of the deal. The remainder will support efforts to combat opioid addiction.",
      "Half of Kentucky\u2019s opioid settlement funds will go directly to cities and counties. A state commission will distribute the rest to groups on the front lines of combating addiction. Organizations have until Jan. 17 to apply for the next round of grant funding to be awarded by the commission, Coleman's office said.",
      "Last year, the commission approved more than $12 million in funding for 51 Kentucky organizations to carry out prevention, treatment and recovery programs, Coleman said.",
      "\u201cThis is real money doing real good across this commonwealth,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell has aided the effort by steering huge sums of federal funding to his home state of Kentucky to help combat its addiction woes.",

      "Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has asked Georgia\u2019s highest court to review a lower appeals court\u2019s ruling that removed her from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others",
      "ATLANTA -- Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has asked Georgia's highest court to review a lower appeals court's ruling that removed her from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals last month ruled that Willis and her office could not continue to prosecute the case because of an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d created by a romantic relationship she had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she had hired to lead the case. In a petition filed late Wednesday, Willis asked the Georgia Supreme Court to review and reverse that decision.",
      "The filing argues that the 2-1 ruling \u201coverreached the Court of Appeals' authority,\u201d creating a new standard for disqualification of a prosecutor and disregarding decades of precedent.",
      "Even if the high court eventually rules in Willis\u2019 favor, it seems unlikely that she will be able to prosecute Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20. But there are 14 other defendants who still face charges in the case.",
      "A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump\u2019s narrow 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump\u2019s call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.",
      "The Georgia case was one of four criminal cases brought last year against Trump. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith abandoned two federal prosecutions after Trump won the November election. The judge in Trump's hush money case in New York has scheduled a sentencing hearing for Friday, though Trump is trying to stop that.",

      "\u201cNo Georgia court has ever disqualified a district attorney for the mere appearance of impropriety without the existence of an actual conflict of interest,\" Willis' filing says. \"And no Georgia court has ever reversed a trial court\u2019s order declining to disqualify a prosecutor based solely on an appearance of impropriety.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Evacuating a wildfire area can be scary, but experts say people can significantly improve their own safety with a little preparation and situational awareness",
      "Evacuating a wildfire area can be scary, but experts say people can significantly improve their own safety with a little preparation and common sense.",
      "Creating a wildfire action plan, packing a \u201cgo bag\u201d and maintaining basic situational awareness during evacuations can make a big difference when escaping a disaster, Jesse Torres, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said",
      "But the most important tip? Don't wait around for an evacuation order, Torres said.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is to get out early, before the notifications come out. It\u2019s so important to avoid the congestion,\u201d he said. That\u2019s especially true in areas that have narrow roadways or limited routes, Torres said, because traffic jams can form quickly: \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing the same thing \u2014 they\u2019re all trying to get out.\u201d",
      "Here are some safety tips on what to do before and during a wildfire evacuation, and what to do if you get trapped.",
      "Many communities, including several in California, have warning alert systems that allow residents to sign up for push notifications to their mobile phones or email accounts.",
      "FEMA has a downloadable app that provides real-time alerts on mobile phones, and public safety agencies can also push alerts to television, radio and wireless devices through the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System. The NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards is a nationwide network of radio stations that broadcast continuous weather information as well as official Weather Service warnings, forecasts and other hazard information.",
      "A battery- or crank-operated portable radio can also be a critical tool for receiving emergency alerts, especially in areas where cellular service is unreliable or when regional cellular towers might be threatened by wind, fire or other hazards.",
      "Household emergency action plans help ensure that all members of a family know exactly what to do and where to go during a wildfire. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says emergency plans should be tailored for a household's unique circumstances, taking into account things like special medical needs or whether a family has livestock.",
      "Strong wildfire action plans typically include: A pre-arranged meeting point well outside the area of danger where household members can meet to determine who has evacuated; multiple escape routes out of the area so people know which way to go if one pathway to safety is blocked; arrangements for any family members with disabilities or medical conditions; arrangements for pets and livestock; and a communication plan that identifies someone outside the area to be the main contact point in case household members get separated.",
      "When it's time to evacuate, having a pre-packed \u201cgo bag\u201d or emergency supply kit can save valuable minutes, Torres said.",
      "Cal Fire says a \u201cgo bag\u201d should include a map with at least two evacuation routes; necessary prescriptions or medical items like eyeglasses; extra car keys, cash or credit cards; a basic first aid kit; a flashlight and battery-powered radio with extra batteries; and copies of important documents like passports or birth certificates. It should also include a three-day supply of non-perishable food and water per person, as well as food and water for any pets. N95 masks can help filter out many of the particles in wildfire smoke, and an extra cellphone battery or charger can also be helpful.",
      "\u201cGo bags\u201d should be accessible and easy to grab in an emergency, Torres said.",
      "\u201cPlan like you're going on a trip for seven days. Have clothes, toilet paper, toothbrush, soap, a towel in there,\u201d Torres said. \u201cYou might end up in an evacuation center, or you might end up with family, so be prepared.\u201d",
      "If time allows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends connecting water hoses and filling garbage cans, tubs, pools and the like with water to help firefighters if they end up on your property.",
      "\u201cClose all your windows, and if you\u2019re able to and aware of how to do it safely, shut off the gas and power to your home,\" he said. Closing doors, windows and vents will help prevent embers from blowing inside and catching the interior on fire, Torres said.",
      "Even if you don't have a \u201cgo bag\u201d or a wildfire action plan set up, don't dally if you feel like danger is near, Torres said.",
      "Fires can move faster than humans, especially when they are driven by high winds. And all sorts of things, including downed power lines, thick smoke, abandoned cars, blowing debris and heavy traffic can impede escape routes during emergencies.",
      "\u201cJust get out of those warning- and evacuation order-zones. If you have family on the other side of the county, go to the other side of the county,\" Torres said. \u201cGet out and get off the roadways as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "If you can't evacuate, your car breaks down or you get stuck for some other reason, don't panic, Torres said. Instead, take a look around and call 911.",
      "\u201cRealize where you are, what street you are at. Can you see an address sign? Call 911, so we can get resources out to you to try to find you,\u201d Torres said.",
      "Sometimes people lose sight of the fire during an evacuation, and it can be hard to tell where they are in all the smoke. An intersection or landmark can help emergency responders identify someone's location and determine if they are in immediate danger, he said. Again, it's crucial not to delay \u2014 go ahead and call 911 to \u201cget that process started,\u201d said Torres.",
      "If someone can walk to a safe spot, they should do that, Torres said. In that scenario, stay on a main route if possible, because that increases the chances of being spotted by a passing car or emergency responder, he said."

    "story": [
      "TikTok will appear before the US Supreme Court on Friday in a last-ditch effort to overturn a ban, in a case testing the limits of national security and free speech.",
      "The popular social media platform is challenging a law passed last year ordering the firm to be split from its Chinese owner or be blocked from the US by 19 January.",
      "The US government is arguing that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",
      "But TikTok rejects that claim, arguing it has been unfairly targeted and the measure violates the free speech of its some 170 million American users.",
      "Lower courts have sided with the government, but the case was complicated last month when President-elect Donald Trump weighed in on the dispute and asked for the enforcement of the law to be paused to grant him time to work out a deal.",
      "Analysts have said it was not clear what the Supreme Court will decide, but that reversing the prior ruling - even with a future president's blessing - would be unusual.",
      "\"When you have a real government interest pitted against a real constitutional value, it ends up being a very close case,\" said Cardozo School of Law professor Saurabh Vishnubhakat.",
      "\"But in such close cases, the government often gets the benefit of the doubt.\"",
      "A decision by Supreme Court could be made within days.",
      "Congress passed the law against TikTok last year with support from both the Democratic and Republican parties. The moment marked the culmination of years of concern about the wildly popular platform, which is known for its viral videos and traction among young people.",
      "The legislation does not forbid use of the app, but would require tech giants such as Apple and Google to stop offering it and inhibit updates, which analysts suggest would kill it over time.",
      "TikTok is already banned from government devices in many countries, including in the UK. It faces more complete bans in some countries, including India.",
      "The US argues that TikTok is a \"grave\" threat because the Chinese government could coerce its owner, ByteDance, to turn over user data or manipulate what it shows users to serve Chinese interests.",
      "Last December, a three-judge appeals court decision upheld the law, noting China's record of acting through private companies and saying the measure was justified as \"part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed\" by the country.",
      "Why could TikTok be banned in the US?",
      "TikTok has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.",
      "It has asked the Supreme Court to strike down the law as unconstitutional, or order its enforcement to be halted to enable a review of the legislation, which it said was based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information\".",
      "Trump is set to take office the day after the law would come into force.",
      "He had called for banning the app in the US during his first term, but changed his tune on the campaign trail.",
      "The brief that Trump's lawyers filed late last month did not take a position on legal dispute, but said the case presented \"unprecedented, novel, and difficult tension between free-speech rights on one side, and foreign policy and national-security concerns on the other\".",
      "Noting his election win, it said Trump \"opposes banning TikTok\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office\".",
      "TikTok says US ban would have \u2018staggering\u2019 impact on free speech",
      "US House passes bill that could ban TikTok nationwide",
      "What could a TikTok ban mean for creators?",
      "The filing came less than two weeks after Trump met TikTok's boss at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "One of the president-elect's major donors, Jeff Yass of Susequehanna International Group, is a big stakeholder in the company.",
      "However, Trump's nominee to serve as secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is in favour of banning the platform.",
      "Investors who have expressed interest in buying the TikTok include Trump's former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and former LA Dodgers owner Frank McCourt.",
      "Attorney Peter Choharis, who is part of a group that filed its own brief supporting the US government's case, said it was hard to predict what the court - which has a conservative majority - would do, noting that several recent court decisions have overturned longstanding precedent.",
      "But he said even if Trump was granted the opportunity to try to work out a deal, he expected a ban eventually.",
      "\"I don't see any president, including future President Trump, being able to resolve this in a way that's satisfactory for US national security because I don't think ByteDance will agree to it,\" he said.",
      "The prospect of losing TikTok in the US has prompted outcry from many users, some of whom filed their own legal action last year.",
      "In their filing they said the decision that TikTok could be shuttered \"because ideas on that platform might persuade Americans of one thing or another - even of something potentially harmful to our democracy - is utterly antithetical to the First Amendment\".",
      "Other groups weighing in on the dispute include the American Civil Liberties Union and Freedom of the Press Foundation, which argued that the US had failed to present \"credible evidence of ongoing or imminent harm\" caused by the social media app.",
      "Mr Choharis said the government had a right to take measures to defend itself, arguing that the fight was not \"about speech\" or \"content\" but about the Chinese government's role.",
      "\"It's about control and how the Chinese Communist Party specifically, and the Chinese government more generally, pursue strategic aims using many internet firms and especially social media companies - specifically including TikTok,\" he said."

      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the last few days. On Tuesday it was worth $1.25 but is currently trading at $1.23.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",

      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",

      "If the OBR says the chancellor is still on track to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules then that might settle the markets.",
      "However, if the OBR were to say because of slower growth and higher-than-expected interest rates, the chancellor were likely to break her fiscal rules then that would potentially be a problem for Reeves.",

      "That blaze, known as the Camp fire, killed 85 people and displaced more than 50,000.",

    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, this year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

    "story": [
      "Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce will expand its Goodwood factory and global headquarters to meet the growing demand for bespoke models.",
      "It will invest more than \u00a3300 million so it can build more highly-customised versions of its cars for its super-rich clientele.",
      "Although UK petrol and diesel car sales are due to be phased out by 2030, the boss of Rolls-Royce declined to say whether the firm would stop selling cars with combustion engines to clients abroad.",
      "Rolls-Royce sold 5,712 cars in 2024, down from its record of 6,032 in 2023, but the total value of its sales was higher due to it selling more bespoke builds.",
      "While those numbers may seem tiny compared with the millions of cars delivered each year by mainstream manufacturers, Rolls-Royce operates in a highly rarefied market.",
      "The brand said it \"does not disclose prices\" but it is understood its cheapest model, the Ghost saloon, sells from about \u00a3250,000 upwards. Its Cullinan sports utility vehicle and electric Spectre models are thought to start at around \u00a3340,000.",
      "As a luxury carmaker focused on export markets, Rolls-Royce is insulated from many of the challenges currently facing the wider European motor industry. However, it has been affected by a fall in demand in China, one of its most important markets.",
      "Earlier this year, Rolls-Royce's boss said rising demand for personalised vehicles was helping to offset that decline.",
      "The 120-year old British brand came under full control of German carmaker BMW in 2003 and officially opened its Goodwood site in West Sussex the same year. Rolls-Royce says this expansion secures its future in the UK.",

      "For some customers, simply owning a Rolls-Royce isn't exclusive enough. In recent years, the company has increasingly focused on building highly-customised versions of its cars, which can then be sold at even higher prices. Its rivals also do this.",
      "This has included cars with holographic paint, containing one-off artworks, or featuring intricate hand-stitched embroidery. One model, designed as a homage to the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, includes features made out of solid 18-carat gold.",
      "That is generating \"more complicated commissions\" and \"driving the need\" to expand Goodwood to have more space, Rolls-Royce chief executive Chris Brownridge told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "But making individually tailored cars, while profitable, is a labour-intensive process that requires time and space.",
      "At the same time, like other manufacturers, the company is preparing for a future in which conventional cars will be phased out and replaced by electric models.",
      "In the UK, the Labour government has committed to phasing out sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and is consulting car manufacturers on how that will work.",
      "Mr Brownridge declined to tell the BBC whether the firm would still be building cars with combustion engines for clients abroad in 2030, but said the firm had a \"very clear roadmap\" and that electric cars were the \"right direction for Rolls-Royce\".",
      "A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said under current plans and legislation, Rolls-Royce would still have the capability to build combustion engine cars in 2030, if that is what clients want.",
      "However, he said that five years \"is a long time\", and legislation may change, adding that by then it may not be feasible for the firm to build such cars.",
      "Rolls-Royce said the extension of its factory would \"create additional space\" for building bespoke cars.",
      "It added that the plan would \"also ready the manufacturing facility for the marque's transition to an all-battery electric vehicle future\".",
      "The carmaker has already been granted planning permission for the expansion of the Goodwood plant, which was built in 2003 and initially housed 300 workers. There are currently more than 2,500 people working on the site, with a further 7,500 in the UK supply chain.",
      "Mr Brownridge said the Goodwood investment confirms the company has \"a very secure business for the long term\", so those jobs \"are very much safe\".",

      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",

      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",
      "No.10 said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\" and \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\" saying that only the OBR's forecast is an accurate predication of the government's room for manoeuvre.",

      "The Debt Management Office, a part of Treasury, effectively paid the highest interest rates for these very long term loans that have been since 1998.",
      "Eyebrows raised over issuance",
      "The markets are raising their eyebrows about debts around the world, and in particular the level of issuance of bonds from countries such as the UK and the US, and additionally, the likelihood of sticky, above target inflation.",
      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",
      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",
      "The rise in rates has affected the US and the UK more, and less so continental Europe. The tick-up in UK market rates after the Budget, initially faded by early December. But now British borrowing rates are moving up alongside US ones.",
      "Stagnant growth and sticky inflation have raised concerns about so-called \"stagflation\". Markets are starting to question the inflationary impacts of incoming President Donald Trump's trade and tax policies.",
      "So while this is not a crisis, it is a new reality. Markets are questioning if the UK really can sustain higher growth and restrained inflation. And those questions are now occurring against the backdrop of the Trump trade tumult affecting global markets for borrowing. It's a bumpy start to 2025."

      "Shein has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2008, and saw its business boom during the pandemic.",

      "But the company, which was founded in China but is now headquartered in Singapore, has come under fire over its environmental impact and working practices, which include allegations of forced labour in supply chains. Shein has denied this.",
      "China has been accused of subjecting members of the Uighur, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority, to forced labour. In December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, but Beijing has denied any rights abuses.",
      "The allegations have led to some big fashion brands, including H&M, Nike, Burberry and Adidas, removing products using Xinjiang cotton, which has led to a backlash in China, and boycotts of the companies.",
      "On Tuesday, MPs on the Business and Trade committee repeatedly challenged Ms Zhu over whether Shein products contained Chinese cotton and in particular cotton from Xinjiang.",
      "Ms Zhu declined to answer and asked if she could write to the committee following the hearing.",

      "Denise Coates, chief executive of the gambling firm Bet365, took a massive pay cut last year, but still received a package worth almost \u00a3158m.",
      "Ms Coates, understood to be the highest-paid director of Bet365 Group and one of Britain's wealthiest women, was paid a salary of \u00a394.7m in the year ending March 2024, down from \u00a3221m the year before.",
      "But she also received dividends of around \u00a363m, according to company accounts.",

      "After persuading her family to mortgage the business to fund and develop new software and setting up headquarters in a temporary building in a car park, she became a pioneer in the shift and growth of online gambling.",
      "The company's growth has seen it become one of the world's biggest online gambling websites and the largest private-sector employer in the Stoke area.",
      "On Monday, the group reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3596.3m for the year, compared with a loss of \u00a372.6m the year before when it was expanding in regions such as North America.",
      "The expansion appears to be paying off, with the group's revenue growing by 9% to \u00a33.7bn. Reduced executive pay also helped profits.",

      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",

      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",

      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

    "story": [
      "If you think Ezra Collective's music is life-affirming, just wait until you meet them in person.",
      "Tumbling into the BBC's Maida Vale studios, the band are boisterous and charming, the sort of people to greet a perfect stranger like a long-lost cousin.",
      "Bandleader and drummer Femi Koleoso has a room-filling smile and a zest for life that infuses his music.",
      "\"We're just trying to bring something positive and joyful to whoever will listen,\" he says. \"So anything that exposes us to more people is always gratefully received.\"",
      "Today, that means the honour of being named runner-up in the BBC's Sound Of 2025.",
      "The annual poll, which has been running since 2003, has tipped everyone from 50 Cent and Adele, to Raye and Dua Lipa for success.",
      "Ezra Collective's addition to the list comes relatively late in their career. They've already won the Mercury Prize, for their second album Where I'm Meant To Be, and last November, they became the first jazz act to sell out Wembley Arena.",
      "But to their minds, the band are still newcomers.",
      "Koleoso recalls the thrumming intensity of making his Wembley debut.",
      "\"Fifteen minutes before the gig, I made the horrific mistake of reading the wall backstage,\" he says.",
      "\"They'd put up the names of everyone who'd played there before us. So it was like, 'OK, Beyonc\u00e9 played here, and Jay-Z and Stormzy and Madonna\u2026 And now it's Ezra Collective's turn'.\"",
      "If they were intimidated, it didn't show. The quintet turn audience participation into an artform, venturing out into the crowd and making fans part of their ensemble, almost like a New Orleans parade.",
      "Reviews were ecstatic, calling the show a \"masterclass in musicianship\" that left \"every single person with a smile on their face.\"",
      "As a result, Ezra Collective's name will be added to the Wembley Wall \u2013 but Koleoso wants it to have a radically different effect.",
      "\"Wouldn't it be great if, in 10 years' time, some band is getting intimidated by Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna, and then they see our name, and they're like, 'Oh yeah, they came into our school to do an assembly - so we'll be fine'?\".",
      "Community and musical kinship is Ezra Collective's foundation stone; one that can be traced back to the youth club Tomorrow's Warriors, where they first met in central London in 2012.",
      "The charity offers training to musicians who can't afford private tuition, with a special focus on \"those with a background from the African Diaspora and girls, who are often under-represented in the music industry\".",
      "\"It's where I met my best friends,\" says Koleoso, who remains a passionate supporter of youth clubs.",
      "\"Not to get too deep, but how do you fix domestic violence or the male suicide rate? You teach a 14-year-old boy how to deal with rejection, how to love people, how to control anger, how to respect others.",
      "\"Youth clubs can help with that. By the time someone's 24, it's almost too late.\"",

      "4) Myles Smith",
      "3) Barry Can't Swim",
      "2) Ezra Collective",
      "1) Revealed on Friday",
      "When Koleoso first visited Tomorrow's Warriors with his brother TJ, they'd already formed a tight rhythm section in their church band. In fact, Femi had been playing drums since he was four.",
      "\"Maybe I'm slightly biased, but I think the drums are the best instrument, because you can see what's going on,\" he says.",
      "\"When I watch our horn section, I'm hearing thousands of notes, but I'm only seeing three valves. It doesn't quite make sense. But with the drums, you hit them and they make a sound.",
      "\"I wish everything was as simple as that.\"",
      "Tomorrow's Warriors introduced Koleoso to jazz, a genre he'd previously considered elite and inaccessible, and to his future bandmates James Mollison (sax), Ife Ogunjobi (trumpet) and Joe Armon-Jones (keyboards).",
      "Together, they ripped the genre rulebook to shreds, magpie-ing elements of Afrobeat, hip-hop, grime, reggae, Latin, R&B, highlife and jazz to create a sound that bulges with possibility.",
      "\"We're the shuffle generation,\" explains Koleoso. \"We listen to Beethoven and 50 Cent comes on straight after. That influences the way we approach music: We love jazz but at the same time I love salsa too, so why not try and get that in there?\"",
      "After playing their first gig in a Foyles bookshop, they released their debut EP, Chapter 7, in 2016, and a debut album, You Can't Steal My Joy in 2019.",
      "Then Covid hit.",
      "\"We were meant to do a world tour but shortly after we arrived in New Zealand, we were told get back to London because the world was collapsing,\" says Koleoso.",
      "Lockdown inspired their second album, but instead of introspection and gloom, it's an immensely energetic record, fuelled by the promise of post-pandemic reconnection.",
      "\"What we found was we had each other,\" says Koleoso. \"It felt like we were meant to be together, and we made as many tracks as we could that articulate that.\"",
      "When it won the Mercury Prize, the follow-up was already in the bag.",
      "Dance, No-One's Watching was recorded over three days (\"one was just setting up\") at Abbey Road Studios, with the band still slightly worse-for-wear after a weekend at the Notting Hill Carnival.",
      "The idea was to capture the excitement of their live show direct to tape \u2013 with an audience of family and friends to stop them obsessing over the technicalities of recording.",
      "\"What you're hearing is very, very real. We just played it and then had a listen back, and were like, 'Yeah, put it on a vinyl'.\"",
      "That's why the album features a short, aborted performance of Ajala, with Koleoso ordering his bandmates to play harder on the next take.",
      "\"A lot of people think that's a skit, but it was a very real moment,\" he says. \"I wanted the song to go off, but it didn't, so we stopped and tried again.",
      "\"Those things are precious, because they will never happen again.",
      "\"There's a lot of things in the world that don't feel real enough, but music shouldn't be one of them.\"",
      "In contrast to its predecessor, the album is immersed in the real world. Themed around a night out in London, it celebrates the sacred power of dancing and losing yourself in music with other people.",
      "There's even a song titled N29, after the night bus Koleso used to catch home from nights out in London.",
      "Anyone who's braved one of those 3am rides home will recognise the song's mixture of post-club euphoria, random conversations and the backdrop of potential violence.",
      "Koleoso says his first experience of that liminal reality came after his high school prom.",
      "\"Our school got one of those fancy little boats on the Thames and everyone paid their \u00a320, which, for a state school in Enfield, was an impressive night out,\" he recalls.",
      "\"This was at the height of grime and funky house, so I'm just having the best time in my life, dancing on this boat in a suit\u2026 then I missed the last tube home.\"",
      "In a time before Google Maps, it took a while to locate the right bus. When he finally clambered on board, it was carnage.",
      "\"I grew 10 years in that one journey, do you know what I mean?\" he laughs. \"I saw waaaay to much life!\"",
      "His desire to document life in all its messy, wonderful glory is the album's core.",
      "\"In 2022, we got to travel the whole world. We had amazing nights in New Orleans, on colourful streets with so much going on that it's hard to describe.",
      "\"And you'd think, 'How do I get this feeling into a song? I want someone in their flat in Edmonton to get a glimpse of this.'",
      "\"Or you'd go to the shrine in Lagos and be like, 'I need to convey the feeling of the shrine to someone who lives in Cardiff.'\"",
      "Ezra Collective's ever-growing audience suggests they've successfully completed that mission.",
      "But there's one person who'll be surprised: Koleoso's A-level music teacher.",
      "\"Here's the secret, I got a D in music,\" he confesses.",
      "\"I was pretty embarrassed, because it made difficult to convince my parents that playing music was gonna be OK.",
      "\"But what it tells you is that exams can determine one type of intelligence, but they're not the be-all and end-all.",
      "\"If there was an exam in shutting down shows, I think I'd do better than a D.\"",
      "Amen to that.",

      "The much-anticipated programme saw superstars including The Rock, John Cena and The Undertaker make appearances during the three-hour event in Los Angeles.",
      "Pro-wrestling's most popular weekly show had previously been shown on broadcast TV around the world for 31 years.",
      "But last year bosses of TKO - the company formed when WWE merged with UFC - announced that Raw would be exclusive to streaming.",
      "It's claimed that it brings in 17.5m viewers each week in the US, and that WWE boasts one billion followers across various social media platforms.",
      "Reviews of the first show suggested it \"was far from perfect\" but that there were \"lots of special moments to cover\".",
      "Another noted the \"amazing production values and improved visuals\" but criticised \"the sameness of the promos\" delivered by stars such as Triple H, The Rock and John Cena.",
      "There was praise for the in-ring action, but widespread agreement that bringing out WWE to use Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan was \"a mis-step\" after loud boos from the California crowd during his appearance.",
      "The show also marked the start of John Cena's \"farewell tour\", with the star announcing 2025 will be his last year as a competitor.",
      "Cena is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time and has achieved world champion status a joint record 16 times since joining WWE in 2001.",
      "He told cheering fans he \"could not think of a better place to start\" his goodbye, while stating his intention to \"win the Royal Rumble\" event in February.",
      "Fans were also treated to the return of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who is a director of TKO.",
      "The Rock has previously played the villainous role of \"The Final Boss\", but on this occasion he spoke about the \"history\" of the night and, to the surprise of many, praised and embraced former rival Cody Rhodes.",
      "He then later appeared at the conclusion of the Tribal Combat Match between Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa, embracing Reigns following his victory.",
      "The night also saw the brief return of The Undertaker at the end of the Women's World Championship match between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley.",
      "It was the culmination of a long-term storyline which saw Ripley win the championship.",
      "The action ended with CM Punk and Seth Rollins following up a much-praised back-and-forth promo on the final televised episode of Raw.",
      "It was a match widely recognised as the highlight of the night's in-ring action, with the sometimes divisive Punk coming out on top.",
      "What the Netflix deal could mean for WWE",
      "Netflix agreed to pay more than $5bn (\u00a34bn) for rights to show Raw and other WWE programming, including archive content.",

      "Raw had a three-hour runtime for 12 years, before cutting down to two at the end of 2024.",

      "\"It was the best thing ever.\"",
      "Since that gig, the 26-year-old's career has only grown bigger.",
      "Last year, he scored his first major hit with Stargazing, a feel-good foot-stomper that became the biggest-selling British single of 2024, and even featured on Barack Obama's end of year playlist.",

      "It was, he says \"the most LA I've ever felt\".",
      "It's certainly a long way from his upbringing in Luton.",
      "Born to a working class British-Jamaican family, he was a bright and happy kid, who grew up singing along to his mum's Motown records.",
      "His first true musical discovery was Coldplay's Yellow (\"it resonated with me, even though I didn't understand a word of it\") but Luton's social and cultural diversity meant he was exposed to hundreds of different genres.",
      "\"I went through a lot of stages,\" he says. \"I was a huge Green Day fan at one point. I even went through a bit of a Screamo phase.\"",
      "Before long, he was writing his own songs \u2013 initially by dreaming up melodies and lyrics to instrumentals he'd found on YouTube, then creating originals on a guitar he'd been given for his ninth birthday.",
      "\"I remember writing this song called Dream Girl, when I was 11,\" he says.",

      "The one that made everyone pay attention was Solo \u2013 whose devious wordplay was so obviously memorable (\"Why'd you get me so high/ To leave me solo\") you couldn't quite believe no-one had thought of it before.",
      "Released independently in 2023, it earned Smith his first UK chart hit and, subsequently, a deal with RCA Records.",
      "But he continued to build his audience organically, gigging constantly while posting on TikTok and YouTube.",
      "He's got an interesting take on social media. While artists like Halsey and Florence Welch have expressed frustration at record label pressure to create viral videos,  Smith calls TikTok a \"meritocratic system\" that rewards the effort you put in.",
      "\"There's a difference between the chase for virality and building an audience,\" he reasons.",
      "\"If your objective is to go viral, then you're always going to be fighting a losing battle. But if your objective is to establish a community and a place where your music belongs, it becomes a lot more rewarding.\"",

      "\"I need you to know, it wasn't my music, it was you,\" he wrote. \"I know this because I've been where you are. I've clung to songs in the dark searching for something \u2013 anything \u2013 that made me feel like I could keep going.",
      "\"But music didn't save me. What saved me was the smallest part of me that chose to stay, even when it hurt.",
      "\"My songs might walk beside you, but it's your strength that carries you forward.\"",
      "That empathy is baked into Smith's lyrics. His most affecting songs, such as River and Wait For You, are covenants of support for a friend who's drowning in their troubles.",
      "His breakout hit, Stargazing, is also about a moment of human connection \u2013 looking into the cosmos and realising \"the person we fall in love with has been there our whole life\".",
      "He's previously claimed the track was inspired by a sunset in Malibu, but it turns out that that's a little white lie.",
      "Smith actually came up with the folky, clap-along chorus and its central lyric (\"You and I stargazing/ Intertwining souls\") while eating tacos and salsa with his co-writers, Peter Fenn and Jesse Fink, early last year.",
      "They were so inspired that they demo'd the song in just 15 minutes \u2013 just as the sun was setting over Malibu.",
      "\"Somehow, that moment gave the lyric a meaning,\" says the singer. \"It was an afterthought, but it was a very beneficial afterthought.\"",
      "He started posting snippets of the song online almost immediately, and \"from the very first post, the reaction was explosive\".",
      "There was only one problem: they hadn't finished the verses.",
      "For a month, they frantically traded voice notes and Zoom calls, pulling the song into focus in time for a May release. Since then, it's been streamed more than 600 million times.",
      "\"It's quite wild,\" says the singer. \"It's still getting played, seven or eight months down the line, which is awesome.\"",
      "Smith ended 2024 with a clutch of honours \u2013 from his first Brit Award, to being named BBC Introducing's Artist Of The Year \u2013 and the release of his new EP, \u2026A Minute.",
      "At the start of 2025, he's juggling writing sessions for his debut album with a hectic touring schedule that sees him playing 36 shows in 60 days in 16 countries. But if that sounds daunting, he's prepared.",
      "\"It's a lot, for sure, but I used to stand on the edge of my sofa and pretend I was at Glastonbury. So being able to tour, at whatever scale, is just such a privilege that it doesn't feel like hard work.\"",

      "In 2020, the Vivienne starred in a six-part series The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood on BBC Three.",

      "Not all drag race contestants and winners have been able to build such a successful brand around themselves despite their humour and flawless looks, which is testament to how The Vivienne's personality shone through in all her work."

      "\"Can that chap sit, do we think?\" asks Dr Raj Paw, a senior consultant in the emergency department at Warwick Hospital.",
      "He is speaking about a patient in his 90s  who was brought in after collapsing at home, where he was found cold and confused.",
      "Now he is stable. Could that open up a bed?",
      "\"If we can get him to sit then he could go into one of the chairs, and that would free up his bed,\" Dr Paw says.",
      "This is the sort of conversation doctors and nurses are having in hospitals up and down the country as a severe flu season puts the NHS under pressure.",
      "More than a dozen hospitals have declared critical incidents - including some of those considered among the best in the country.",
      "Earlier this week, the BBC visited Warwick Hospital. It is run by the South Warwickshire trust, which is one of the top rated in the country and has prided itself on the smooth running of its four hospitals.",
      "But the caseload has been overwhelming this week.",
      "Warwick Hospital has 375 beds and at one point the predicted demand was almost 100 more than that. For the first time ever, it's had to declare a critical incident - the highest alert level in the NHS.",
      "The BBC was there when hospital administrators made the call. Declaring a critical incident is a warning to the local health system that things are getting bad. Often, it frees up hospitals to redeploy doctors and create new temporary ward space.",
      "Over a two-day period, the BBC saw doctors and nurses doing just that: finding stop-gap solutions to treat patients in whatever safe settings could be established.",
      "With emergency departments overflowing, sick people need to be treated in the chairs they're sitting in.",
      "Others have had to wait in ambulances parked outside emergency units for hours before they could even be taken inside.",
      "One such patient is Percy, who is in his 80s and experiencing liver failure. He came to hospital because he had been feeling sick and had lost weight over recent weeks.",
      "Dr Arun Jeyakumar, a senior registrar on the ward, is one of the doctors sent out to check on patients like Percy.",
      "Hopping into the ambulance, he has a brief consultation with him. He tells Percy that everything is being done to get him into the hospital.",
      "Percy smiles back weakly, resigned to the wait.",
      "The paramedic who brought him to the hospital is also resigned: he's seen plenty of cases like Percy's this season.",
      "He turns up the heating in the back of the ambulance and sits down again as Dr Jeyakumar hops out and closes the doors.",
      "Back in the emergency department, doctors, nurses and consultants discuss how to make space for new arrivals.",
      "Beds are at an absolute premium in the hospital. So many patients have arrived that a room near the ambulance entrance has been set up for people considered \"fit to sit\".",
      "Every chair is occupied.",
      "\"It isn't ideal,\" one doctor says. \"But it is safe.\"",
      "Porters have to wheel beds through this open space, between patients being treated in chairs and nurses kneeling on the floor to remove cannulas. Drip stands are shuffled back and forth to make room.",
      "We see a nurse taking a patient, who is still attached to a drip, to the loo in a wheelchair.",
      "She leaves the chair in the corridor and helps the patient in. A porter comes and goes to move the vacant wheelchair.",
      "The nurse dashes back out. \"That's my wheelchair,\" she cries.",
      "We roll it back to her and she starts to laugh. \"You can't take your eye off them for a second or another patient will be in it,\" she says - only half joking.",
      "Elsewhere, Percy makes it from the ambulance to the emergency department, after a three hour wait.",
      "\"It's getting worse,\" he says, wincing as he closes his eyes - but it will be another 12 hours before Percy is admitted to a ward.",
      "When we see him finally being moved, he is contorted in his bed from the pain, clutching onto a sick bowl.",
      "Dr Paw's first job during his rounds is to check the cubicles to see who he can move off beds.",
      "He has a full waiting room just beyond the doors and four ambulances banked up outside.",
      "A woman in the last cubicle he visits is crying. Dr Paw receives an update from a nurse on her condition and orders some morphine.",
      "\"You're in the right place,\" he tells the patient. \"We'll sort out your pain.\"",
      "Dr Paw tells us: \"The people that come in now are sicker than they used to be. And here we are, trying to get them out quicker.\"",
      "He then moves on to a man who was admitted for a heart attack two days ago but is no longer receiving active treatment. Can he safely be moved, Dr Paw wonders.",
      "\"These are the decisions we're being forced to make,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"I'm considering moving a heart attack patient to the waiting room so I can have his cubicle.\"",
      "Another patient Dr Paw saw the previous day is still waiting for a bed in the ward more than 24 hours later.",
      "\"It's rubbish. It's not what should happen,\" Dr Paw says. \"People shouldn't be spending 27, 28 hours in an emergency department.\"",
      "At one point during our time at the hospital we were taken to a bank of screens displaying statistics.",
      "It showed that patients in the emergency department were waiting nearly 30 hours for a bed and there were six ambulances queued up outside. One had been there for four hours.",
      "\"It's the worst I've ever seen it,\" one doctor says.",
      "South Warwickshire Trust stood down the critical incident on Thursday \u2013 it had been in place for 48 hours. Staff told the BBC though that the pressures on the hospital were still intense."

    "summary": "An outbreak of the flu-like virus in China is causing concern, but experts say a Covid-like pandemic is unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "A surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China has raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic.",
      "Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years.",
      "They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.",
      "What is HMPV, what are the symptoms, and how does it spread?",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, HMPV spreads through direct contact between people, or when someone touches a contaminated surface.",
      "The virus leads to a mild upper respiratory tract infection for most people.",
      "It is usually almost indistinguishable from flu.",
      "Symptoms for most people include a cough, a fever and blocked nose.",
      "The very young, including children under two, are most vulnerable to the virus.",
      "It also poses a greater risk to those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and those with advanced cancer, according to Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases specialist in Singapore.",
      "If infected, a \"small but significant proportion\" of immunocompromised people can develop more severe disease where the lungs are affected, with wheezing, breathlessness and symptoms of croup.",
      "\"Many will require hospital care, with a smaller proportion at risk of dying from the infection,\" Dr Hsu said.",
      "Why are HMPV cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring.",
      "This is because viruses survive better in the cold, and can pass more easily from one person to another as people spend more time indoors with closed windows.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",
      "Many other countries in the northern hemisphere - including the US - are also experiencing a growth in rates of HMPV, said Jacqueline Stephens, an epidemiologist at Flinders University in Australia.",
      "\"While this is concerning, the increased prevalence is likely the normal seasonal increase seen in winter,\" she said.",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) is monitoring rates of flu-like illness across the Northern hemisphere, and said it has not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns in China or elsewhere.",
      "It said Chinese authorities have confirmed that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses to date.",
      "Is HMPV spreading in the UK?",
      "The incidence of HMPV in the UK has risen steadily since October 2024.",
      "The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA)  does not publish the number of cases recorded.",
      "However its latest data shows the percentage of people testing positive for the disease rose sharply in the third week of December and remained at that higher level the following week.",
      "But the UKHSA says this is completely in line with normal seasonal trends, and the level of the disease being seen in GP surgeries and hospitals is as expected.",
      "Is there any chance of another Covid-like pandemic?",
      "Fears of a Covid-style pandemic are overblown, experts say, noting that such events are typically caused by new viruses, which is not the case with HMPV.",
      "The disease is already globally present and has been around for decades. This means people across the world have \"some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure\", Dr Hsu said.",
      "\"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life,\" said Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.",

      "Sophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app.",
      "She found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.",
      "To solve this, she explains: \"I was very vocal about what I was doing, so there was no pressure when I got there [to social events] but there was still real self-discipline to do it.\"",
      "Since completing it, she's stuck to some part of the plan such as not eating out or buying unnecessary coffees and cakes, helping her \"save so much money\".",

      "She suggests finding a way to \"challenge yourself while also being kind\", so that you add fun and value to every day, without exercise and food feeling like a punishment.",

    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",

      "Listen to this article",
      "Jane Graham has been a school nurse for nearly 20 years \u2013 and during this time the nature of her work has completely changed. \"When I started, the majority of the support we provided was for physical health, like asthma, allergic reactions and injuries,\" she says. \"Now it's mental health.\"",
      "She has seen a surge in schoolchildren struggling. \"It really impacts pupils at secondary school, but some are as young as seven,\" she explains.",
      "\"We're seeing children with depression, anxiety and stress \u2013 and that's leading to panic attacks, self-harm and eating disorders. They're not making it to school or are so anxious they cannot attend classes.\"",
      "GPs, youth workers and social workers I have spoken to shared similar stories, with many pointing out that mental health cases in the young are rising in ever greater numbers.",
      "One in five children and young people between the ages of eight and 25 in England are now thought to have a mental health disorder, according to official figures. Unsurprisingly, the NHS is struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2024 Dame Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, described the situation as \"shocking\" and said the system was in \"crisis\".",
      "But it is not just a crisis that is placing demands on the health service. It's also depriving the economy of workers with rising numbers of young people being left unable to work.",
      "What's less clear is why this is happening now.",
      "Plenty of explanations have been offered by experts: the pandemic, the cost of living and the advent of social media have all placed additional pressures on the generation now starting out.",
      "But some experts in the field of mental health have raised another question: that is, is there really a mental health crisis or are young people simply not resilient enough?",
      "In other words, are they lacking the capacity to withstand or recover quickly from day-to-day difficulties that generations before them faced too?",
      "A polarising debate",
      "This question is a polarising one. The word resilience could be interpreted by some as disparaging, or even toxic, in a similar vein as the term \"snowflake generation\".",
      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese, from King\u2019s College London, believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

    "story": [
      "Nothing has been more important to the Labour Party under Sir Keir Starmer than economic credibility.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out clear fiscal rules, such as getting debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament, and she has made sticking to these rules a crucial test of the government's credibility.",
      "That's what makes the recent rise in government borrowing costs potentially so dangerous for Reeves, the Treasury and - arguably - Sir Keir Starmer's entire political project.",
      "If the government has to spend a lot more money paying interest on debt, then it is less likely to meet its rules.",
      "On current trends, 26 March is set to become a critical date.",
      "That is when the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will deliver its latest forecasts, including an assessment of whether the government is on course to meet its fiscal rules or not.",
      "Suppose the OBR says the government is not on course. It's important to stress this may not happen - but it is something that senior government figures are growing more jittery about by the minute.",

      "She has previously committed only to make significant tax and spend announcements once a year at the autumn Budget.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said last night that \"meeting the fiscal rules is non-negotiable\".",
      "That would suggest she would have to break her commitment and announce, or at least pave the way for, measures to bring the government in line with its rules.",
      "What could that mean?",
      "In principle, it could mean either tax rises or spending restraint.",
      "In practice, given the announcement of a significant increase in employers' National Insurance rates in October, the government's view is that it would have to mean spending restraint - Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, practically said as much in the Commons today.",
      "To be clear, spending restraint would not necessarily mean spending cuts, just much lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "This is where economics could collide with politics fast.",
      "It's all very well for the Treasury to take measures to soothe the bond markets, where government debt is traded.",
      "But just because a strategy is deemed the most economically viable available, that doesn't mean it is politically viable in a Labour Party made up of MPs who have spent the past 14 years decrying Conservative austerity.",
      "Many Labour MPs, among them cabinet ministers, believe there is little fat left to trim from the state.",
      "They were already anxious about a tough multi-year spending review, expected to conclude around June, before borrowing costs rose.",
      "There is almost a risk of a paradox: that any acts of spending restraint visible and significant enough to calm the markets might, by definition, be too visible and too significant to fly politically among Labour MPs  - especially after the controversy of the cut to the winter fuel payment for pensioners.",
      "Labour figures argue that successive Conservative governments dealt with similar problems by piling the most painful spending measures towards the end of five-year forecast periods - hoping that by the year at which those \"pencilled-in\" measures were reached, circumstances would have changed.",
      "But some also voice a fear that - precisely because of the Conservatives having done this - repeating the trick would be given short shrift by the markets: the fiscal sins of previous governments being visited on this new one.",
      "Unlike recent Conservative debates on economic policy, the Labour Party has one big asset.",
      "In 2022, when Liz Truss decided to go big, with a radical tax-cutting agenda, the Conservative Party had no consensus on how to approach the economy.",
      "The 2022 leadership election in which Truss defeated Rishi Sunak was essentially a clash of economic ideas.",
      "She won that argument with Tory members, having lost it among the party's MPs  - and then lost it unambiguously with the public and the markets within 49 days.",
      "The Labour Party, give or take some sotto voce debates about tax for the wealthiest and welfare for the poorest, does broadly have an economic consensus, especially when it comes to what the Conservatives did wrong.",
      "But what if these shared beliefs in how best to run the economy turn out to be products of the low interest rate era?",
      "And how do you maintain that consensus if the markets disagree?",
      "This is a political worst case scenario for Reeves.",
      "Asking influential Labour figures about the markets this morning was to be told that lines go down as well as up, that the markets can move the other way in rapid time.",
      "But all acknowledge that it is a bad sign when the value of the currency goes down at the same time as the cost of borrowing goes up.",
      "One government source said to me: \"It's definitely not tin hat time yet.\"",
      "But all are watching anxiously to see how things develop."

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has insisted new sanctions on smuggling networks are a \"really important step\" to stopping illegal migration into the UK.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir said using counter-terrorism tactics like freezing smugglers' bank accounts will allow the UK to \"break\" their business model.",
      "Under the plans announced this week, the government will also be able to freeze assets of \"those that help to get people into this country\" illegally and launch travel bans.",
      "Critics have argued the measures are too minor to stop small boat crossings.",

      "Suspected people smugglers face phone and travel ban",
      "People smugglers to have finances targeted with sanctions",
      "The new sanctions plans are designed to disrupt the flow of money and could be imposed on companies and individuals aiding illegal migration, including those that manufacture materials for small boat crossings.",
      "The proposed measures, which are yet to be finalised, would mean UK-based individuals and financial institutions would be banned by law from dealing with sanctioned groups.",
      "The government will bring forward new legislation for the scheme, drawn up by government sanction experts alongside law enforcement and Home Office staff.",
      "Many smugglers operate in an informal cash-based network, making it hard for the authorities to target their assets.",
      "But it could be easier to sanction the supply chains helping the people smugglers, and the middle-men joining up the networks and helping to move asylum seekers across Europe to northern France.",
      "The new plans were \"very similar to the powers we have used against terrorists, which allows us to seize their assets, to stop them travelling, and to put them out of business.\"",
      "\"And so that is a really important step,\" Sir Keir said.",
      "He also hailed the plans as \"a world first\".",
      "The fact people smuggling is \"so lucrative\" is the \"very reason we need to go for the money\", he said.",
      "\"The people running this trade are only interested in the amount of money that they can make, and if you can break that model, you can reduce that organized crime.\"",
      "The new powers would work in tandem with other policies announced by Sir Keir, including extra funding for the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the UK's new Border Security Command (BSC) to make more arrests.",
      "\"The power of the sanctions is you can do it much more quickly at a much earlier stage\" than arrests, Sir Keir added - letting law enforcement stop offenders earlier.",
      "Sir Keir said the new policy draws on lessons he learned as Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from 2008 to 2013, before entering politics.",
      "He said: \"As I learned as a chief prosecutor, follow the money, break the model.\"",
      "Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said: \"Labour has no credibility on dealing with the evil trade in people smuggling.",
      "\"In Parliament they voted against tougher punishments and life sentences for people smugglers, abolished the Rwanda deterrent and campaigned in favour of the rights of dangerous criminals and foreign national offenders, over the safety of the British people.",

      "The prime minister was asked about the suggestion by President-elect Donald Trump's counter terrorism advisor Sebastian Gorka that the UK should repatriate ISIS supporters from Syrian camps, including Shamima Begum.",
      "Sir Keir said any repatriation will be \"determined on a case-by-case basis\".",
      "But the \"driving principle will be 'What is in our national security?'\" he said."

      "The foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia.

      "About 40 tractors rolled into the streets of Oxford city centre blaring their horns, as Environment Secretary Steve Reed addressed a national farming conference.",
      "In his speech, Reed he was \"sorry\" decisions had upset farmers but argued \"stable finances are the foundation of the economic growth needed\".",

      "\"I'm sorry that some of the action we had to take shocked you in turn, but stable finances are the foundation of the economic growth needed.\"",
      "Pressed by reporters, Reed said he was apologising for having \"to take decisions that are very difficult for the sector because of what we inherited\".",
      "In his speech, Reed said the government would offer a \"new deal for farmers\" that would help them become more profitable.",
      "Measures under the deal include delivering Labour's manifesto pledge to ensure that 50% of food in schools, hospitals, army bases and prisons paid for with public sector money would come from local farms or would be produced to high environmental standards.",
      "Reed told the BBC that could be worth \u00a32.5bn to domestic food producers, adding: \"What I am announcing today are hard measures that will put money directly into farmers' pockets for the hard work they put in to put food on all of our tables.\"",

      "\"The problem is the industry is on an absolute knife-edge.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's online attacks on former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown over grooming gangs draw on a baseless claim about a Home Office memo supposedly issued 17 years ago, research by BBC Verify has established.",
      "A wave of social media posts - including some amplified by Mr Musk - allege that a 2008 Home Office document advised police not to intervene in child grooming cases because victims had \"made an informed choice about their sexual behaviour\".",
      "But BBC Verify has carried out extensive searches of Home Office circulars issued across that period and found no evidence that any document containing this advice exists.",
      "Brown - who was prime minister in 2008 - has called the allegations \"a complete fabrication\" and the Home Office says there \"has never been any truth\" to them.",
      "'Informed choice'",
      "Social media posts referencing a memo and using either the phrase \"informed choice\" or a variation like \"lifestyle choice\" have circulated for several years with some gaining traction.",
      "But that intensified dramatically since the start of the year, with posts repeating the claim generating tens of millions of views in the past week after Mr Musk amplified several of them on his social media platform, X.",
      "In one post, which has received over 25 million views, Mr Musk alleged that \"Gordon Brown sold those little girls for votes\" while reposting another user, June Slater, using words that were apparently a variation of the memo claim.",
      "The original unfounded claim about a Home Office circular to police seems to stem from an interview Nazir Afzal - the former Crown Prosecution Service chief prosecutor for north-west England - gave to the BBC on 19 October 2018. He now admits that he had not seen any such circular himself, despite apparently stating its existence as fact.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he told presenter Carolyn Quinn at the time:",
      "\"You may not know this, but back in 2008 the Home Office sent a circular to all police forces in the country saying 'as far as these young girls who are being exploited in their towns and cities we believe they have made an informed choice about their sexual behaviour and therefore it's not for you police officers to get involved in\".",
      "Although the programme is no longer available to listen to on the BBC's website, a version has been uploaded to YouTube. BBC Verify has also accessed the programme through the BBC's in-house archives to confirm the audio is genuine.",
      "The first post referencing Mr Afzal's claim appears to have been made one month after his interview, BBC Verify has found. But the first post to gain considerable traction was in July 2019.",
      "Since then posts with versions of the claim have circulated occasionally on X and other platforms, with some posts from larger accounts in 2024 getting more attention, before intensifying massively in recent days.",
      "Misinterpreted instructions",
      "Speaking to BBC Verify, Mr Afzal clarified his position admitting that he has never seen any circular with the form of words that he used in his 2018 interview.",
      "Instead he now says he was referring to police officers who had told him some officers had misinterpreted instructions in a circular sent by the Home Office.",
      "Mr Afzal pointed us to Home Office circular 017/2008 which is about the police's powers under the 1989 Children's Act.",
      "However, the words \"informed choice\" do not appear anywhere in the text, nor is the circular about child grooming gangs.",
      "It does contain, however, a section on how to judge significant harm to a child. \"It is important always to take account of the child's reactions, and his or her perceptions, according to the child's age and understanding,\" it reads.",
      "It seems difficult to understand how any police officer could misconstrue this section in the way Mr Afzal described in his 2018 interview",
      "He told BBC Verify he was \"paraphrasing what I thought that meant to them\", when he gave his Radio 4 interview.",
      "Asked how officers could have interpreted circular 17/2008 in this way, Mr Afzal said:",
      "\"You're right, it doesn't stack up. It doesn't give an excuse or explanation, but I can't give you any other circular.\"",
      "BBC Verify also asked Mr Afzal if he could put us in touch with any of the officers that may have misinterpreted the circular in way he described, but he was unable to do this.",
      "Mr Afzal's claim was not a one off. One year before his 2018 interview, Mr Afzal wrote an article for the International Business Times where he also stated the claim as fact:",
      "\"The term \"child prostitute\" was used extensively to describe them and it should be noted both that the Home Office in a circular to police in 2008 used that term and spoke of girls making an \"informed choice\" to engage in this behaviour. Parliament only finally removed the term from all laws a couple of years ago.\"",
      "Despite interest in the claim going back several years we have been unable to identify any individual who is able to provide evidence of any circular to this effect.",
      "Home Office memos contain no reference to term",
      "The purpose of the circulars - or memos - is to provide police forces with guidance, policy updates and administrative instructions.",
      "The Home Office says all memos and circulars to police forces are published online in the National Archives. They are also kept in the library of the College of Policing website.",
      "BBC Verify searched all the circulars for 2008 and could find no reference to \"informed choice\" or \"child prostitute\" or any phrase similar to the one cited in the social media posts.",
      "Of the 32 circulars listed on the National Archives website for 2008, only one - 017/2008 - falls under the category \"child abuse\". We have also searched circulars for 2007, 2009 and 2010 and found no references to \"informed choice\". We also searched for other phrases in Mr Afzal's original statements and variations from later social media posts - for example \"get involved\", \"sexual behaviour\" and \"lifestyle choice\" - and found no occurrences.",

      "We were able to find a circular from 2009 that links to a webpage that further links to a document on child sexual exploitation released by the Department for Children, Schools and Families that mentions the phrase \"informed choice\". It is not an instruction to police and the context it appears in is emphasising situations where local agencies might need to report sexual activity in order to protect children \"unable to make an informed choice\".",
      "There were circulars in 2007 and 2010 that contained the phrase \"child prostitute\". The first was in connection with some technical changes to offences like \"controlling a child prostitute\". The second again dealt with technical changes but this circular on prostitution also said: \"In short, any steps taken, whether relating to criminal proceedings or not, should be designed to protect the child from continuing sexual exploitation and abuse.\"",
      "The term \"child prostitute\" was taken out of the law in 2015 as it could imply that children could consent to abuse.",

      "\"They would've gone to crime registrars and the head of the crime and they would've cascaded the guidance,\" he said.",
      "If there was any doubt about how to interpret the guidance a force would have gone back to the Home Office to seek clarity, Mr Bailey added.",
      "\"And even going back 17 years, I cannot believe the Home Office would've sent out a circular of that nature.\"",
      "'Never been any truth'",
      "In a statement to BBC Verify, the Home Office said it had never instructed police not to go after grooming gangs:",
      "\"There has never been any truth in the existence of a Home Office circular telling police forces that grooming gangs should not be prosecuted, or that their victims were making a choice, and it is now clear that the specific circular which was being referred to does absolutely no such thing.\"",
      "Jacqui Smith - now Baroness Smith - was the Labour Home Secretary in 2008. She told BBC Verify: \"It is categorically wrong that the Home Office or I instructed police forces not to prosecute grooming gangs or not to protect young girls.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Gordon Brown said:  \"There is no basis for such allegations at all. They are a complete fabrication. There is no foundation whatsoever for alleging that Mr Brown sent, approved or was in anyway involved with issuing a circular or statement to the police because it did not happen.\"",
      "'Got lost in translation'",
      "BBC Verify has attempted to speak to those who repeated the claim on X and had their posts amplified by Mr Musk.",
      "In one post, Mr Musk alleged that \"Gordon Brown committed an unforgivable crime against the British people\" and shared a video clip from campaigner Maggie Oliver appearing on GB News.",
      "In the clip, Ms Oliver alleged: \"Gordon Brown sent out a circular to all the police forces in the UK saying 'do not prosecute these rape gangs, these children are making a lifestyle choice'.\"",
      "Ms Oliver said that she based her claim on what Mr Afzal said:",
      "\"My knowledge of this comes from what Nazir Afzal said publicly in 2018 in his BBC interview.\"",
      "BBC Verify also reached out to June Slater, whose post was also amplified by Mr Musk. She told us she had not seen the memo, but her claim was also based on what Mr Afzal and Ms Oliver had previously said:",
      "\"I thought he was a reliable source as is Maggie Oliver.\"",
      "Asked if he regretted the misinformation that had stemmed from his statements, Mr Afzal told BBC Verify:",

      "BBC Verify also contacted the Police Federation, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing about the alleged circular.",

      "She noted Ms Bird was not prevented from returning to work, and so the sum made allowances for the unfair process involved in her removal but not for her lack of progress in her political career.",
      "The judge said any higher compensation could put her in line with someone who had suffered scarring or permanent loss of vision and \"it seems to me that the loss of feeling cannot be compared to the loss of an eye\".",

      "Reform UK MP Lee Anderson called for a crackdown on \"feral families\" with a \"three strikes and you're out\" policy if neighbours were affected by antisocial behaviour.",
      "In a surprise twist, Labour MP Steve Yemm labelled the plan \"too liberal and lenient\" and demanded a zero tolerance policy.",
      "Responding in the Westminster Hall debate, Labour housing minister Alex Norris admitted current eviction laws \"don't always work\" and said tougher action was being worked on by the government.",
      "Aim for no-fault eviction ban to be in place by summer",
      "'I had panic attacks after my eviction notice'",
      "'Anti-social behaviour makes me scared all the time'",
      "MPs debate issues they are concerned about in Westminster Hall, a room next to the House of Commons, but it does not lead to a change in the law.",
      "Anderson said he set up the debate on antisocial behaviour because it \"destroys and ruins lives\" and was blighting \"every constituency throughout our great country\".",
      "Claiming the threat of eviction could transform offenders into good tenants, the Ashfield MP said: \"We need a deterrent.... I believe in a 'three strikes and out' rule.\"",
      "Responding to questions about where evicted tenants would live, he said: \"I'm not bothered about where they go.",
      "\"I've got two options for these people - they can either behave themselves and become good tenants, good neighbours, and integrate.",
      "\"Or they could do what other people do, normal people - go and get a job, stop committing crime, save some money up, work hard, save a deposit... and then go and private rent somewhere.\"",
      "However, neighbouring MP for Mansfield in the East Midlands, Steve Yemm, said asking victims of antisocial behaviour to spend years collecting and providing evidence of three breaches was too much.",
      "The Labour MP said: \"I would argue that this proposition is somewhat too liberal and lenient and doesn't go far enough to address the issues.\"",
      "Intervening, Anderson responded he was \"astounded\" and asked Yemm to agree to a \"one-strike and you're out\" rule instead.",
      "Yemm answered \"that's exactly what I'm saying\", adding victims - the majority of them women - had to \"endure... many, many years of suffering under this type of abuse\" and too many were then told no action could be taken.",

      "Another Labour MP, Andrew Cooper, said the authorities also needed to stop dumping tenants \"grappling with addiction\" into social housing without adequate support and called for more preventative action.",
      "Liberal Democrat housing spokesman Gideon Amos said the best deterrent would be better funding for police and councils to use the powers they already have.",
      "He set out how existing powers already allowed for \"one strike\" eviction in the worst cases, so Anderson's plan would only \"make the law weaker and give comfort to the most antisocial culprits\".",
      "The MP for Taunton and Wellington, who is also a social housing landlord, added: \"Simply evicting tenants onto the streets won't reduce antisocial behaviour, it will move the antisocial behaviour from the house to the street where all the evidence suggest it will only get worse.\"",
      "Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said social housing should be \"a privilege not a right\" and the public only wanted \"decent and hardworking people that have contributed to this country\" to be given social housing.",
      "The Conservative MP said: \"It's good to see across the House today we seem to be in violent agreement about the three strikes policy, which seems to be a maximum not a minimum.\"",
      "Housing minister Alex Norris called attention to the Labour government's Safer Streets focus on boosting police numbers to tackle antisocial behaviour and the new Respect Orders, which he said should be toughened up.",
      "He said: \"Crucially I think there is a significant gap at the moment for those who make persistent offences, that those penalties [should] grow and are serious ones.\"",
      "Norris said there was also ongoing work on the Renters' Rights Bill, with new powers for social landlords to seek evictions \"immediately in the most serious cases\" and for judges to take the offenders' engagement with efforts to support them into account.",
      "However, he also highlighted how a home could be \"a real foundation\" for families and said there should still be a focus on supporting those, particularly single mums, who were struggling."

      "Finally, many housing experts doubt private housebuilders are capable of delivering enough new homes each year to reach the targets.",

      "The Competition and Markets Authority concluded in February 2024  \"private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices\".",
      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",
      "That's why some argue meeting the government's targets will also require a major increase in Whitehall grants to not-for-profit local housing associations, enabling them to build tens of thousands of new social and affordable homes, mainly to be rented out, in the coming years.",

      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "One of the ways it can borrow money is by selling financial products called bonds.",
      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",

      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",

      "So while this is not a crisis, it is a new reality. Markets are questioning if the UK really can sustain higher growth and restrained inflation.

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 21:02:19 GMT",
    "summary": "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK seems to have momentum, but will it last?",
    "story": [
      "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding.",
      "But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage.",
      "The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK.",
      "One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness.",
      "A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on.",
      "And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.",
      "As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000.",
      "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part.",
      "The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.",
      "And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.",
      "But how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?",
      "Tactics and controversy",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.",
      "I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.",
      "Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.",
      "Trump and Musk",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.",
      "From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business).",
      "But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?",
      "Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.",
      "Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".",
      "Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time.",
      "And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".",
      "Cash and growth",
      "So Farage has new friends and new energy \u2013 and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance.",
      "Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that \u2013 he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum.",
      "The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only \u00a370,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file.",
      "Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament.",
      "As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.",
      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut \u00a35 out of every \u00a3100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence.",
      "To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable.",
      "And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind \u2013 it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?",
      "Success - a distant prospect?",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment \u2013 they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025.",
      "Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour.",
      "He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\".",
      "Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away.",
      "And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man \u2013 born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the clich\u00e9 that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives.",
      "In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go.",
      "Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress.",
      "In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May.",
      "A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed.",
      "Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.",

    "story": [
      "A spacecraft built in the UK has captured new images of Mercury as it made its sixth and final flyby ahead of entering the planet's orbit in 2026.",
      "BepiColombo was built by the Stevenage-based company Astrium, now Airbus, and launched in 2018.",
      "The spacecraft comprises two satellites that will gather data for at least a year, and needs special shielding to withstand the heat from the sun.",

      "It said a previous survey had recorded bumblebees and honeybees between Christmas and New Year at locations across the UK, including the Highlands.",

      "\"The fact that there are active workers means not only have the queens awakened from hibernation but they have gone to the extent of starting new nests.\"",

    "summary": "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year across England, Wales and Scotland.",
    "story": [
      "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year as the UK moved further away from planet-warming fossil fuels to power the nation, new data shows.",
      "Wind generated nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), up from nearly 79TWh in 2023, show figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso), which coordinates electricity distribution.",
      "Electricity generation from major fossil fuel power stations fell to just over a quarter of the total last year as other renewable sources, such as solar, also rose, along with electricity imports.",
      "The government wants less than 5% of electricity to come from polluting fossil fuels by 2030.",
      "Neso - the government's independent system planner and operator for the energy transition - has previously described the government's 'Clean Power 2030 Action Plan' as \"achievable\" but \"at the limit of what is feasible\".",
      "The government considers clean electricity to include renewables, such as wind, solar, hydropower and bioenergy, as well as nuclear power.",
      "Together, these sources generated around 56% of Great Britain's electricity in 2024 - a new high, according to preliminary Neso data that will be confirmed this week.",
      "Major fossil fuel generation (mainly gas) fell to 26%, while a further 16% came from imported electricity.",
      "Neso data does not cover Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator, SONI.",
      "The figures only include fossil fuel and biomass generation from major power stations connected to the main transmission network. For these sources, Neso does not include smaller-scale operators that feed in electricity at a local level, although typically these contribute a relatively small fraction of fossil fuel power.",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "UK to finish with coal power after 142 years",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "As a result, government figures for 2024 due in March, which will take into account all power sources, may differ slightly from Neso's data. But the direction of travel is clear.",
      "Back in 2014, wind and solar accounted for around 10% of Great Britain's electricity. That has now risen to about a third, according to Neso's figures.",
      "Over the same period, fossil fuel generation has fallen by more than half.",
      "That is mainly thanks to a sharp fall in coal generation - the dirtiest fossil fuel - with the UK's final coal power station closing in 2024. Gas generation has also begun to decline.",
      "This has helped to significantly clean up Britain's power generation.",
      "In 2024, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 124g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - a new low, and down from 419g/kWh in 2014, according to Neso.",
      "But gas remains a crucial part of the UK's electricity mix, helping to maintain power supply when output from weather-dependent wind and solar sources drops.",
      "Britain's wind turbines can generate huge amounts of electricity when weather conditions are right, as shown by the darkest blue in the chart below.",
      "On around 10 days in December alone, more than 50% of Great Britain's electricity generation came from wind.",
      "However, there are of course less windy periods when electricity generation from wind drops. In the longer term, these gaps could be filled using emerging green technologies, such as batteries, to store energy during windier times.",
      "There could also be extra incentives for people to use electricity during windy periods, for example by offering cheaper prices.",
      "But for now, gas power stations, a ready source of on-demand energy, need to be fired up to fill the gaps. For three consecutive days between 11-13 December, for example, more than 60% of electricity generation came from gas as wind output dropped.",
      "In its plan for meeting the 2030 clean energy target published last month, the government committed to keeping a reserve capacity of gas power stations for this purpose.",
      "Last month Claire Coutinho, Conservative shadow secretary of state for energy security, said Labour's \"rush\" to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030 would push up electricity prices and cause more hardship for people across Britain.",
      "\"We need cheap, reliable energy - not even higher bills,\" she said."

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 01:28:52 GMT",
    "summary": "After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.",
    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:17:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Pharmaceutical firms are turning to AI to find new molecules that might be able to tackle disease.",
    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, this year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

      "Aoun said one of his main priorities was repairing the destruction caused by \"Israeli aggression\" in southern Lebanon, Beirut's southern suburbs and the eastern Bekaa Valley during the war, which the World Bank estimates will cost $8.5bn (\u00a36.9bn).",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

      "\"My worry is that this [resistance to H-1B visas] could also spark animosity towards the Indians living there. But I can't park my ambitions, put my life on hold and wait for the volatility to subside because it's been like this for years now,\" Mr Chauhan says.",
      "Efforts to restrict the H-1B programme peaked under Trump's first term, when he signed a 2017 order increasing application scrutiny and fraud detection. Rejection rates soared to 24% in 2018, compared to 5-8% under President Barack Obama and 2-4% under President Joe Biden. The total number of approved H-1B applicants under Biden remained similar to Trump's first term.",
      "\"The first Trump administration tightened H-1B visas by increasing denial rates and slowing processing times, making it harder for people to get visas in time. It is unclear whether that will happen again in the second Trump administration,\" Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School, told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people like Elon Musk want to preserve the H-1B visas, while other officials in the new administration want to restrict all immigration, including H-1Bs. It is too early to tell which side will prevail.\"",
      "Indians have a long relationship with the H-1B visa. The programme is also the reason for the \"rise of Indian-Americans into the highest educated and highest earning group, immigrant or native in the US\", say the authors of The Other One Percent, a study on Indians in America.",
      "US-based researchers Sanjoy Chakravorty, Devesh Kapur and Nirvikar Singh noted that new Indian immigrants spoke different languages and lived in different areas than earlier arrivals. Hindi, Tamil and Telugu speakers grew in number, and Indian-American communities shifted from New York and Michigan to larger clusters in California and New Jersey. The skilled visa programme helped create a \"new map of Indian-Americans\".",
      "The biggest draw of H-1B visas is the opportunity to earn significantly higher salaries, according to Mr Chauhan. The US offers higher pay, and for someone who is the first in their family to achieve professional qualifications, earning that much can be life-changing. \"The fascination with H-1Bs is directly tied to the wage gap between India and the US for the same engineering roles,\" he says.",
      "But not everybody is happy with the programme. For many, the H-1B programme is an aspirational pathway for permanent residency or a US green card. While H-1B itself is a temporary work visa, it allows visa holders to live and work in the US for up to six years. During this time, many H-1B holders apply for a green card through employment-based immigration categories, typically sponsored by their employers. This takes time.",
      "More than a million Indians, including dependents, are currently waiting in employment-based green card categories. \"Getting a green card means signing up for an endless wait for 20-30 years,\" says Atal Agarwal, who runs a firm in India that uses AI to help find visa options globally for education and jobs.",
      "Mr Agarwal moved to the US after graduating in 2017 and worked at a software company for a few years. He says getting the H-1B visa was fairly straightforward, but then it seemed he had \"reached a dead end\". He returned to India.",
      "\"It's an unstable situation. Your employer has to sponsor you and since the pathway to a green card is so long, you are basically tied to them. If you lose your job, you only get 60 days to find a new one. Every person who is going on merit to the US should have a pathway to a green card within three to five years.\"",
      "This could be one reason that the visa programme has got tied up with immigration. \"H-1B is a high-skilled, worker mobility visa. It is not an immigration visa. But it gets clubbed with immigration and illegal immigration and becomes a sensitive issue,\" Shivendra Singh, vice president of global trade development at Nasscom, the Indian technology industry trade group, told the BBC.",
      "Many in the US believe the H-1B visa programme is flawed. They cite widespread fraud and abuse, especially by major Indian IT firms which are top recipients of these visas. In October, a US court found Cognizant guilty of discriminating against over 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022, though the company plans to appeal. Last week, Farah Stockman of The New York Times wrote that \"for more than a decade, Americans working in the tech industry have been systematically laid off and replaced by cheaper H-1B visa holders\".",
      "Mr. Singh of Nasscom argues that H-1B visa workers are not underpaid, as employers must pay them above the prevailing or actual wage of comparable US workers in the area. Companies also invest tens of thousands of dollars in legal and government fees for these costly visas.",
      "Also, it has not been a one-way traffic: Indian tech giants have hired and supported nearly 600,000 American workers and spent over a billion dollars on upskilling nearly three million students across 130 US colleges, according to Mr Singh. The Indian tech industry has prioritised US worker hiring and they bring employees on H-1B visas only when they are unable to find locals with the skills they need, he said.",
      "India is working to ensure the H-1B visa programme remains secure as Trump prepares to take office later this month. \"Our countries share a strong and growing economic and technological partnership, and the mobility of skilled professionals is a vital component of this relationship,\" India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told journalists last week.",
      "So what should students aspiring for jobs in the US do? \"Any immigration changes in the US will take time to implement. Students should pick the best college for them, wherever that may be. With good immigration counsel, they will be able to figure out what to do,\" says Mr Yale-Loehr.",
      "For now, despite the political turbulence in the US, Indian interest in H-1B visas remains steadfast, with students resolute in pursuing the American dream.",

Trivett Jr., said in court on Wednesday.",
      "Even if the pleas go ahead, it would be many months before these proceedings would begin and a sentence ultimately delivered.",

      "Following the announcement of the deal last summer, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, then the party's leader in the chamber, released a statement describing it as \"a revolting abdication of the government's responsibility to defend America and provide justice\".",

      "Some families of those killed in the attacks have also criticised the deal, saying it is too lenient or lacks transparency.",

      "Ms Strada, the national chair of the campaign group 9/11 Families United, said: \"This is a victory for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other two, it's a victory for them.\"",
      "Other families see the agreements as a path towards convictions in the complex and long-running proceedings and were disappointed by the government's latest intervention.",

      "\"We take this situation very, very seriously,\" said Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen of Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland \u2013 and punish Denmark with high tariffs if it stands in the way.",
      "But, he added, the government had \"no ambition whatsoever to escalate some war of words.\"",
      "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed Trump's own suggestion that the US might use military force to seize Greenland. \"I don't have the fantasy to imagine that it'll ever get to that,\" she told Danish TV.",
      "And Lars Sandahl Sorensen, CEO of Danish Industry, also said there was \"every reason to stay calm... no-one has any interest in a trade war.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hastily organised high-level meetings have been taking place in Copenhagen all week, a reflection of the shock caused by Trump's remarks.",
      "Greenland PM Mute Egede flew in to meet both the prime minister and King Frederik X on Wednesday.",
      "And on Thursday night, party leaders from across the political spectrum gathered for an extraordinary meeting on the crisis with Mette Frederiksen in Denmark's parliament.",
      "Faced with what many in Denmark are calling Trump's \"provocation,\" Frederiksen has broadly attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, repeatedly referring to the US as \"Denmark's closest partner\".",
      "It was \"only natural\" that the US was preoccupied by the Arctic and Greenland, she added.",
      "Yet she also said that any decision on Greenland's future should be up to its people alone: \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders... and it's the Greenlanders themselves who have to define their future.\"",
      "Her cautious approach is twofold.",
      "On the one hand, Frederiksen is keen to avoid escalating the situation. She's been burned before, in 2019, when Trump cancelled a trip to Denmark after she said his proposal to buy Greenland was \"absurd\".",
      "\"Back then he only had one more year in office, then things went back to normal,\"  veteran political journalist Erik Holstein told the BBC . \"But maybe this is the new normal.\"",
      "But Frederiksen's comments also speak to the Danish resolve not to meddle in the internal affairs of Greenland \u2013 an autonomous territory with its own parliament and whose population is increasingly leaning towards independence.",
      "\"She should've been much clearer in rejecting the idea,\" said opposition MP Rasmus Jarlov.",
      "\"This level of disrespect from the coming US president towards very, very loyal allies and friends is record-setting,\" he told the BBC, although he admitted Trump's forcefulness had \"surprised everybody.\"",
      "The conservative MP believed Frederiksen's insistence that \"only Greenland... can decide and define Greenland's future\" placed too much pressure on the island's inhabitants. \"It would've been prudent and clever to stand behind Greenland and just clearly state that Denmark doesn't want [a US takeover].\"",
      "The Greenland question is a delicate one for Denmark, whose prime minister officially apologised only recently for spearheading a 1950s social experiment which saw Inuit children removed from their families to be re-educated as \"model Danes\".",
      "Last week, Greenland's leader said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism.\"",
      "By doing so he tapped into growing nationalist sentiment, fuelled by interest among Greenland's younger generations in the indigenous culture and history of the Inuit.",
      "Most commentators now expect a successful independence referendum in the near future. While for many it would be seen as a victory, it could also usher in a new set of problems, as 60% of Greenland's economy is dependent on Denmark.",
      "An independent Greenland \"would need to make choices,\" said Karsten Honge. The Social Democrat MP now fears his preferred option of a new Commonwealth-style pact \"based on equality and democracy\" is unlikely to come about.",
      "Sitting in his parliamentary office decorated with poems and drawings depicting scenes of Inuit life, Honge said Greenland would need to decide \"how much it values independence\". It could sever ties with Denmark and turn to the US, Honge said, \"but if you treasure independence then that doesn't make sense.\"",
      "Opposition MP Jarlov argues that while there is no point in forcing Greenland to be part of Denmark, \"it is very close to being an independent country already\".",
      "Its capital Nuuk is self-governed, but relies on Copenhagen for management of currency, foreign relations and defence - as well as substantial subsidies.",
      "\"Greenland today has more independence than Denmark has from the EU,\" Jarlov added. \"So I hope they think things through.\"",
      "As Mette Frederiksen has the awkward task of responding firmly while not offending Greenland or the US, the staunchest rebuttal to Trump's comments so far has come from outside Denmark.",
      "The principle of the inviolability of borders \"applies to every country... no matter whether it's a very small one or a very powerful one,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned, while French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the EU would not let other nations \"attack its sovereign borders\".",
      "Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?",
      "Russia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland",
      "Their comments gave away the deep concern within the EU about how to handle the upcoming Trump presidency. \"This is not just very serious for Greenland and Denmark \u2013 it is serious to the whole world and to Europe as a whole,\" MP Karsten Honge said.",
      "\"Imagine a world \u2013 which we may be facing in just a few weeks \u2013 where international agreements don't exist. That would shake everything up, and Denmark would just be a small part of it.\"",
      "The Danish trade sector has similarly been engulfed by deep nervousness after Trump said he would \"tariff Denmark at a very high level\" if it refused to give up Greenland to the US.",
      "A 2024 Danish Industry study showed that Denmark's GDP would fall by three points if the US imposed 10% tariffs on imports from the EU to the US as part of a global trade war.",
      "Singling out Danish products from the influx of EU goods would be near-impossible for the US, and would almost certainly result in retaliatory measures from the EU. But trade industry professionals are taking few chances, and in Denmark as elsewhere on the continent huge amounts of resources are being spent internally to plan for potential outcomes of Donald Trump's second term in the White House.",
      "As his inauguration approaches, Danes are preparing as they can to weather the storm. There is guarded hope that the president-elect could soon shift his focus to grievances towards other EU partners, and that the Greenland question could be temporarily shelved.",
      "But the disquiet brought on by Trump's refusal to rule out military intervention to seize Greenland remains.",
      "Karsten Honge said Denmark would have suffer whatever decision the US takes.",
      "\"They just need to send a small battleship to travel down the Greenland coast and send a polite letter to Denmark,\" he said, only partly in jest.",
      "\"The last sentence would be: well, Denmark, what you gonna do about it?",
      "\"That's the new reality with regards to Trump.\""

      "For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches.",
      "Swallowing up the sand, blocking ocean views and turning the shore into an irksome maze, is a sea of large beach tents, called cabanas in Australia.",
      "\"It's chockers [crowded]. They're all over the place,\" Sydneysider Claire, 30, told the BBC.",
      "For her \u2013 and most Australians \u2013 cooling off on a sweltering day means a solid drive to the coast, plus an eternity trying to find a parking space. Now, the cabana craze means there's another battle waiting for them on the beach.",
      "Polyester covers flap in the breeze as far as the eye can see. Some are empty, set up at the crack of dawn and then abandoned for hours on end, until the owners actually want to use them.",
      "\"The sheer amount of space that people are taking up\u2026 [when] you're just trying to find a free square inch of sand to lay your towel, it can just be a little bit frustrating,\" Claire says.",
      "She's not alone in her irritation. Several summers of simmering tension has, in the first days of 2025, exploded into a full-on turf war, sparking debate about Australian culture and beach etiquette.",
      "A row over the acceptable use of cabanas has dominated social media, spawned a wave of opinion pieces and television segments, and even dragged in the prime minister.",
      "Self-described haters say entitled cabana crews are hogging public space and disrespecting other beachgoers.",
      "\"When you're\u2026 polluting the beach with your four cabanas next to each other, where is Guncle [Gay Uncle] Nic going to go,\" anti-cabana crusader and TikToker Nic Salerno said on TV talk show The Project.",
      "\"I just want my space on the beach, guys.\"",
      "But the pro-cabana mob say seeking protection from Australia's vicious sun isn't a crime - and it's every man for himself.",
      "Australia is the skin cancer capital of the world, and many supporters \u2013 including national charity, the Cancer Council \u2013 argue the new trend should actually be celebrated.",
      "\"My partner and I have a cool cabana because we both burn extremely easily and we don't want to die of skin cancer by 30, hope this helps,\" one person wrote, responding to a TikTok rant.",
      "No one is discounting the importance of sun safety, the cabana critics counter, but they say that's just a convenient excuse for many of the people using the beach tents.",
      "Half the time they're not even sitting under the shade covers, they claim, and there's no need for two people to whip out an entire tent for an hour or two, when sun cream and a hat will do just fine.",
      "Other cabana devotees are more forward about their motivations. Breakfast television presenter Davina Smith admitted that for her, it is about nabbing \"the prime piece of real estate\" on busy beaches.",
      "She is one of the people who pitch their cabana castles in the early morning to reserve territory for her family later that day.",
      "\"There's a lot of research that goes into this. You get up early, you've got to watch the tides. You can't just plonk it there and walk away\u2026 you invest in it,\" Smith argued on Nine's Today programme.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the hordes irked by the trend: \"That's not on,\" he told the same show.",
      "\"One of the great things about Australia, unlike some parts of the world, you go and you got to pay to go to the beach. Here, everyone owns the beach\u2026 And that's a breach of that principle, really.\"",
      "Even lifeguards have opinions on the matter, with some telling local media the cabana camps can make it hard for them to do their jobs.",
      "Why is this so divisive?",
      "There are a number of cultural quirks which mean Cabanagate has Australians more worked up than a magpie in spring.",
      "Firstly, the country loves to think of itself as an egalitarian society \u2013 the land of a \"fair go\" \u2013 and that extends to the use of one of its most precious national assets.",
      "\"Australian beaches, they always have been seen as shared spaces, democratic spaces where social hierarchies dissolve\u2026. [they're] seen as a great equaliser,\" says Ece Kaya, a researcher at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "And Australians are \"fiercely\" protective of that ideal: \"They see it as a birthright,\" says Chris Pepin-Neff, who studies Australian beach culture.",
      "They point to the backlash in 1929 when beachgoers at Sydney's Coogee Beach were forced to pay for access to the only part of the water covered by shark nets. More recently, a bid to rent out part of Sydney's famous Bondi Beach to an exclusive beach club was met with a huge outcry.",
      "And while the use of sprawling cabanas is a relatively new phenomenon, there's long been \"enormous class tension\" around the use of the country's coastline, Dr Pepin-Neff adds.",
      "A lack of infrastructure, affordable housing and community attitudes tend to lock ordinary Australians out of waterfront areas, while those natural assets are often monopolised by those lucky enough to live there.",
      "\"And there's a perception that it's encroaching even further, [so] that an average family can't even get a spot at the beach.\"",
      "The year the Australian Dream died",
      "Inside the Australian magpie\u2019s annual reign of terror",
      "But they say there's no real data on who is using cabanas and why. They also argue there's many good reasons people might use them. Maybe they've travelled a long way so they plan to stay at the beach longer, or they may have a disability or young children they need to cater for, he says.",
      "\"There is a balance between a free and open beach that everybody can use, and making sure that you're respectful.\"",
      "They offer no defence for the \"land bankers\" though: \"As a Sydneysider, I think that is abusing the privilege\u2026 that is not a fair go.\"",
      "As the debate intensifies though, there are some calls for a truce to restore the peace to Australian shores.",
      "Beachkit Australia founder Rowan Clark, who sells equipment including cabanas, told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper even he thinks cabana lovers should be more courteous.",
      "\"They should only allow set up at the rear of the beach in a line,\" he said. \"Once this is exhausted, then no more of this style of shade should be allowed.\"",
      "Others want authorities to rein it in, like some have in the United States. There are suggestions councils could limit how many cabanas can be set up on their beaches, and where.",
      "But Sydney resident Claire, for all her wrath, worries that this could tip the scales in the other direction and exclude other people from using the beach.",
      "\"You don't want to get too precious about it, obviously\u2026 it's just the beach, first world problems right?",
      "\"I think in general, we should just try to be considerate of one another.\""

    "story": [
      "At 20 years old, Pierre Poilievre already had a roadmap for Canada.",
      "Canada's Conservative Party leader - now 45 - laid out a low-tax, small government vision for the country in an essay contest on what he would do as prime minister.",
      "\"A dollar left in the hands of consumers and investors is more productive than a dollar spent by a politician,\" he stated.",
      "Poilievre is one step closer to making his vision a reality, and even gave a nod to the essay in a recent interview with conservative psychologist and commentator Jordan Peterson.",
      "For months, Poilievre's Conservatives have enjoyed a large lead over the struggling Liberals in national surveys, suggesting they would win a majority government if an election were held today.",
      "Now Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he's standing down, and with an election likely to be called soon, Poilievre is promising a return to \"common sense politics\".",
      "For Canadians frustrated with a sluggish economy and a housing and affordability crisis, he is offering an alternative to what he has labelled as Trudeau's \"authoritarian socialism\".",
      "A win would make him part of a wave of populist leaders on the right who have toppled  incumbent governments in the west.",
      "While it has invited comparisons to Donald Trump - and he has fans like Elon Musk and others in the US president-elect's orbit - Poilievre's story is very much a Canadian one.",
      "A Calgarian with his eyes set on Ottawa",
      "Poilievre was born in Canada's western province of Alberta to a 16-year-old mother who put him up for adoption. He was taken in by two school teachers, who raised him in suburban Calgary.",
      "\"I have always believed that it is voluntary generosity among family and community that are the greatest social safety net that we can ever have,\" he told Maclean's Magazine in 2022, reflecting on his early life.",
      "\"That's kind of my starting point.\"",
      "As a teenager, Poilievre showed an early interest in politics, and canvassed for local conservatives.",
      "Poilievre was studying international relations at the University of Calgary when he met Stockwell Day, who served as a cabinet minister under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.",
      "At the time, Day was seeking the leadership of the Canadian Alliance - a right-wing party with Alberta roots that became part of the modern-day Conservatives in a 2003 merger - and he tapped Poilievre to help with campus outreach.",
      "\"He impressed me from the start,\" Day told the BBC in an interview. \"He seemed to be a level-headed guy, but full of energy and able to catch people's attention.\"",
      "Day's leadership bid was successful, and he set out for Ottawa with Poilievre as his assistant. Some time after, Poilievre walked into his office on a cold winter night to ask his opinion about potentially running for office.",
      "Poilievre went on to win a seat in Ottawa in 2004 at the age of 25, making him one of the youngest elected Conservatives at the time. He has held that seat since.",
      "From \"Skippy\" to party leader",
      "In Ottawa, Poilievre was given the nickname Skippy by peers and foes alike due to to his youthful enthusiasm and sharp tongue.",
      "He built a reputation for being \"highly combative and partisan\", said Randy Besco, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto.",
      "Behind the closed doors of Conservative caucus meetings, Poilievre showed his diplomatic side, Day said.",
      "\"Pierre was always good at saying, 'Okay, you know what? I hadn't thought of that,' or he would listen and say: 'Have you thought of this?'\" said Day.",
      "Still, confrontational politics became a cornerstone of Poilievre's public persona. After becoming Conservative leader in 2022, he would target Trudeau with biting remarks as a way to connect with disaffected voters.",
      "It has landed him in trouble at times. In April, he was expelled from the House of Commons for calling the prime minister a \"wacko\".",
      "Poilievre told the Montreal Gazette in June that he is a fan of \"straight talk\".",
      "\"I think when politesse is in conflict with the truth, I choose the truth,\" he said. \"I think we've been too polite for too long with our political class.\"",
      "His combative style has also been divisive, and he has been criticised for oversimplifying complex issues for political gain.",
      "While Canadians have been open to the opposition leader's message as a change from Trudeau's brand of progressive politics, just over half of them hold an unfavourable opinion of him, according to the latest polls.",
      "Poilievre has also had to shift his sights since Trudeau's resignation announcement, to get ahead of the inevitable match-up between him and the next Liberal leader.",
      "Poilievre on populism, immigration and Trump",
      "The Conservative leader has been described as a \"soft\" populist for his direct appeals to everyday Canadians and criticism of establishment elites, including corporate Canada.",
      "He came out in support of those who protested vaccine mandates during the 2021 \"Freedom Convoy\" demonstrations that gridlocked Ottawa for weeks.",
      "He has pledged to deliver \"the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history\", promising to keep repeat offenders behind bars.",
      "On social matters, Poilievre has rarely weighed in - something Prof Besco said is typical of senior Conservatives, who see these topics as \"a losing issue\".",
      "While Poilievre voted against legalising gay marriage in the early 2000s, he recently said it will remain legal \"full stop\" if he is elected.",
      "The Conservatives also do not support legislation to regulate abortion, though they allow MPs to vote freely on the issue.",
      "\"I would lead a small government that minds its own business,\" Poilievre said in June.",
      "Amid a public debate in Canada in recent months on immigration, the party has said it would tie levels of newcomers to the number of new homes built, and focus on bringing in skilled workers.",
      "Poilievre's wife, Anaida, arrived in Canada as a child refugee from Caracas, Venezuela.",
      "The Conservative leader has pushed for the integration of newcomers, saying Canada does not need to be a \"hyphenated society\".",
      "One of his major promises - to cut Trudeau's national carbon pricing programme, arguing it is a financial burden for families - has raised questions over how his government would tackle pressing issues like climate change.",
      "Canada also faces the threat of steep tariffs when Trump takes office later this month, with the US-Canada relationship expected to be a major challenge.",

      "The young political activist says he had been running an errand when a group of hooded men intercepted him, covered his face and beat him, accusing him of being a terrorist.",
      "\"They planted Molotov cocktails and petrol on me, and then took me to a detention centre,\" he continued.",
      "He was held in a prison in the interior of Venezuela for several weeks until he was transferred to Tocor\u00f3n, a notorious high-security prison about 140km south-west of the capital, Caracas.",
      "There he would go through what he describes as the worst experience of his life.",
      "\"When we arrived at Tocor\u00f3n, they stripped us, beat us, and insulted us. We were forbidden to raise our heads and look at the guards; we had to lower our heads to the floor,\" Juan recounts.",
      "Juan was assigned a small cell measuring three metres by three metres, which he had to share with five other people.",
      "There were six beds arranged in three bunk beds, and in one corner there was a septic tank and \"a pipe that served as a shower\". That was the bathroom.",
      "\"In Tocor\u00f3n I felt more like I was in a concentration camp than in a prison,\" says the young man. He describes the beds as \"concrete tombs\" with a very thin mattress.",
      "\"They tortured us physically and psychologically. They wouldn't let us sleep, they were always coming to ask us to get up and line up,\" he explains.",
      "\"They would wake us up around 05:00 to line up behind the cell. The guards would ask us to show our passes and numbers.\"",
      "He adds that at around 06:00 they would turn on the water for six minutes so they could bathe.",
      "\"Six minutes for six people and just one shower, with very cold water. If you were the last one there and you didn't have time to take off the soap, you were left covered in soap for the rest of the day,\" he says.",
      "Then, he adds, they waited for breakfast, which sometimes arrived at 06:00 and other times at 12:00.",
      "Dinner was sometimes at 21:00, and sometimes at 02:00.",
      "\"Apart from waiting for meals, there was nothing else to do. We could only walk around inside the small cell and tell stories. We also talked about politics, but in low voices, because if the guards heard us, they would punish us.\"",
      "'I thought I was going to die'",
      "Juan says that many of his fellow inmates were depressed and acted like zombies.",
      "\"They gave us rotten food \u2013 meat scraps like you would give to chickens or dogs or sardines that had already expired.\"",
      "Some detainees were routinely beaten or made to \"walk like frogs\" with their hands on their ankles, he says.",
      "He describes \"punishment cells\" where those considered the most rebellious would be sent, or those who dared to talk about politics or ask to make a phone call to relatives.",
      "Juan says that he had been in one of the punishment cells in Tocor\u00f3n, and that he had only received one meal every two days.",
      "\"It's a very dark cell, one metre by one metre. I was very hungry. What kept me going was thinking about all the injustices that were happening and that one day I would get out of there,\" he says.",
      "Another torture cell is known as \"Adolfo's bed\", Juan says, named after the first person who died there.",
      "\"It's a dark, oxygen-deprived room the size of a vault. They put you in there for a few minutes until you can't breathe and you faint or start banging on the door in desperation. They put me in there and I lasted just over five minutes. I thought I was going to die,\" he recalls.",
      "Reports of crimes against humanity",
      "The young man says that in this prison, inmates have 10 minutes to exercise outside three times a week, but many just stay in their cells.",
      "Foro Penal's Gonzalo Himiob describes the conditions in Tocor\u00f3n as \"deplorable\" and says that detainees' fundamental rights, such as having access to a lawyer of the detainee's choosing, are being violated.",
      "\"They all have public defenders - the government knows that if it allows access to a private attorney who is not a public official, he or she can document all the due process violations that are occurring.\"",
      "In October, United Nations (UN) experts reported serious human rights violations committed in the run-up to the presidential election and during the protests that followed, including political persecution, excessive use of force, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions by state security forces and related civilian groups.",
      "The International Criminal Court (ICC) is currently investigating the Venezuelan government for possible crimes against humanity.",
      "The Venezuelan government denies the accusations and says this investigation \"responds to the intention of instrumentalising the mechanisms of international criminal justice for political purposes\".",
      "The BBC requested an interview with the Public Prosecutor's Office about the allegations of mistreatment and torture of detainees, but had not received a response by the time of publication.",
      "'I'm no longer afraid of the government'",
      "Juan was released in November, but according to Foro Penal's figures, there were still 1,794 political prisoners in Venezuela as of 30 December.",
      "According to Juan, many of those detained in Tocor\u00f3n have pinned their hopes on one date: that of the presidential inauguration on 10 January 2025.",
      "It is the day that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, who has been living in exile in Spain, has said that he will return to Venezuela and take up office as president.",
      "He bases his claim to the presidency on official voting tallies the opposition managed to gather with help of election observers.",
      "These tallies, which amount to 85% of the total, have been uploaded to a website and reviewed by independent observers who say that they suggest an overwhelming victory for Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden met Gonz\u00e1lez and called him the \"true winner\" of the Venezuelan election.",
      "However, it is not clear how Gonz\u00e1lez, for whom the authorities have issued an arrest warrant, plans to enter Venezuela or who would swear him in given that the National Assembly is dominated by Maduro loyalists.",
      "Nevertheless, Juan says that the prisoners held in Tocor\u00f3n are hoping against hope that Friday will see a change of government and their release from jail.",
      "Meanwhile, the Maduro government has labelled any talk of a political transition as \"a conspiracy\" and has threatened that anyone who backs a change of leader \"will pay for it\".",
      "Juan admits feeling a certain sense of guilt for being free when hundreds of his \"comrades are still suffering\" in prison.",
      "But he says he is determined to return to the streets to show his support for  Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez on 10 January.",
      "\"I no longer fear the Venezuelan government,\" he explains.",
      "\"They already accused me of the worst crimes, such as terrorism, even though I'm just a young man who has done nothing more than love his country and help those around him.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:17:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Though the president-elect's rhetoric is unusual, for over a century a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "US President-elect Donald Trump has repeated his intention to take control of Greenland, the Arctic territory controlled by Denmark.",
      "Why is Trump talking about this - and why now?",
      "Where is Greenland?",
      "Greenland, the world's largest island, is located in the Arctic.",
      "It is the world's most sparsely populated territory. About 56,000 people live there, mostly indigenous Inuit people.",
      "About 80% of its territory is covered by ice, meaning most people live on the south-western coast around the capital, Nuuk.",
      "An autonomous territory of Denmark, it is also home to Danish and US military bases.",
      "The economy is mainly based on fishing. Large subsidies from the Danish government account for about a fifth of GDP.",
      "In recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. These may become more accessible as global warming leads to some of the ice covering Greenland to melt.",
      "What is Greenland's status?",
      "Located geographically within North America, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years.",
      "The island was governed as a colony until the mid-20th Century. For much of this time, it remained isolated and poor.",
      "In 1953, it was made part of the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlanders became Danish citizens.",
      "In 1979, a referendum on home rule gave Greenland control of most policies within the territory, with Denmark retaining control over foreign affairs and defence.",
      "Why does Greenland matter to the US?",
      "The US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland, establishing military and radio stations across the territory.",
      "After the war, US forces remained in Greenland. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US ever since.",
      "In 1951, a defence agreement with Denmark granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases.",
      "\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College.",
      "\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"",
      "China and Russia have begun building up their Arctic military capabilities in recent years, according to an Arctic Institute paper. The paper called for the US to further develop its presence in the Arctic to counter its rivals.",
      "On Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Denmark was open to discussions with the US, adding that Washington had \"legitimate\" interests in the region.",
      "\"We see a Russia that is arming itself. We see a China that is also starting to take an interest,\" Rasmussen said.",
      "Trump is also likely interested in the mining potential across Greenland's vast landmass, Mr Jacobsen added.",
      "\"Today, of special interest are the rare earth minerals, which have not yet been mined but are in the southern part of Greenland. These are immensely important in all kinds of technologies, from cell phones to wind turbines.\"",
      "Does the US want full control of Greenland?",
      "Trump has claimed that control of Greenland is essential to US national and economic security.",
      "Though the president-elect's rhetoric may seen unusual, for over a century a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland.",
      "\"The US has tried a few times to push the Danes out of Greenland and take it over as part of the US, or at least to have full security tutelage of Greenland,\" said Lukas Wahden, the author of 66\u00b0 North, a newsletter on Arctic security.",
      "In 1867, after buying Alaska from Russia, US Secretary of State William H Seward led negotiations to buy Greenland from Denmark, but failed to reach any agreement.",
      "In 1946, the US offered to pay $100m (equivalent to $1.2bn; \u00a3970m today) for the territory, judging that it was vital for national security, but the Danish government refused.",
      "Trump also tried to buy Greenland during his first term. Both Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"",
      "What do the people of Greenland think?",
      "Kuno Fencker, a member of the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, said on Wednesday that he didn't see Trump's comments as a threat.",
      "Fencker, who supports Greenlandic independence, told  the BBC that a sovereign Greenland could choose to co-operate with the US on defence.",
      "But when Trump first raised the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, many locals told the BBC they were opposed to the proposal.",
      "\"This is a very dangerous idea,\" said Dines Mikaelsen, a tour operator who was born and raised in Tasiilaq, east Greenland.",
      "\"He's treating us like a good he can purchase,\" said Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister.",
      "\"He's not even talking to Greenland - he's talking to Denmark about buying Greenland.\""

      "The US Treasury has imposed sanctions on Antal Rogan, one of the most powerful men in Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz government and the minister in charge of his cabinet office.",
      "It is a rare move between Nato allies, and symbolic of the depth to which US-Hungarian relations have sunk since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago.",
      "\"Antal Rogan is a primary architect, implementer and beneficiary of this system of corruption,\" read the statement, made by outgoing US Ambassador David Pressman.",
      "Pressman leaves Budapest next week, after two and a half years spent as an unusually active diplomat, travelling the country and frequently criticising the Orban government.",
      "His departure comes days ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House, and the president-elect has a far more positive view of Viktor Orban than the Biden administration, seeing him as a close political ally.",
      "\"While Minister Rogan's media megaphones will try to make this a story about partisan politics or an affront to sovereignty, today's decision is actually the reverse,\" Pressman told reporters in Budapest on Tuesday.",
      "\"It is not the United States that threatens Hungary's sovereignty, but rather the kleptocratic ecosystem Minister Rogan has helped to build and direct and that he has benefited from personally.\"",
      "The ambassador's statement was immediately attacked by Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.",
      "\"This is the personal revenge of the ambassador who was sent to Hungary by the failed US administration, but left without success and in disgrace,\" Szijjarto wrote on Facebook.",
      "\"How good it is that in a few days' time the United States will be led by people who see our country as a friend and not as an enemy.\"",
      "A former US ambassador to Hungary, David Cornstein, also came to Rogan's defence: \"The move by outgoing ambassador David Pressman is an example of the current US administration's hostile stance towards Hungary, right down to the last hour.\"",
      "The question for the incoming Trump presidency, and its next ambassador to Budapest, is whether they will immediately overturn the sanctions against Antal Rogan.",
      "The answer is not as obvious as might appear.",
      "Rogan also oversees the domestic secret services, and there have been indications from several Nato countries that Hungary is no longer trusted with sensitive information because of the Orban government's close relations with Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
      "And for all the expressions of outrage at the decision to impose sanctions on Orban's head of cabinet, several senior figures in the Fidesz establishment have long been privately upset by the lifestyle of Rogan and others, by the power he wields, and the distance from the conservative and Christian values that the party proclaims so loudly."

      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

    "story": [
      "\"Inside Edition\" correspondent Alison Hall is opening up about her breast cancer journey and how actress Olivia Munn's own cancer diagnosis influenced Hall's decision to seek testing. Hall shared her story on \"CBS Mornings,\" explaining how Munn's advocacy for early detection, along with a breast cancer risk assessment tool, led to her life-saving diagnosis.",
      "Munn credited the risk assessment test, which uses various factors to evaluate lifetime breast cancer risk, for her early diagnosis. After hearing Munn's story, Hall decided to take the same test. To her surprise, a doctor revealed that Hall's lifetime risk for breast cancer was 36%.",
      "\"Wow, OK, that feels high,\" Hall said, after hearing the news.",
      "Hall, whose mother had breast cancer at age 50, had already undergone genetic testing for the BRCA gene in her 20s, which came back negative. She also had never had a mammogram until this year, after taking the risk assessment test.",
      "Following the assessment, Hall was placed on a regular screening schedule, including mammograms and MRIs every six months. After an MRI revealed some abnormalities, Hall underwent biopsies, which confirmed she had breast cancer.",
      "\"This is actually good news,\" her doctor told her. \"It's stage zero, the earliest it could possibly be caught.\"",
      "Hall was preparing to report on Munn's battle with breast cancer when she received her diagnosis. Hall described it as \"surreal\" to become part of the news.",
      "\"I was prepared to do the test in order to promote awareness for breast cancer, especially with it being a subject so close to my heart,\" she said. \"I didn't expect it to happen so soon, especially.\"",
      "Hall has chosen to undergo a double mastectomy next week to remove the current cancer and lower her risk of future diagnoses.",
      "\"I want to do whatever I can to prevent that for my future self and my future family,\" Hall said.",
      "Munn sent \"CBS Mornings\" a statement to deliver to Hall, saying, \"You are now on the path to survival ... By telling your story, you are creating a ripple effect of hope and saving lives.\"",
      "Hall expressed deep gratitude for Munn's words and emphasized how sharing her story could help others.",
      "\"By Olivia sharing her story, she had a direct impact on my life,\" Hall said.",
      "As Hall prepares for her upcoming surgery, she is grateful for the support of her family and friends, including her husband, whom she calls her \"human support person.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 19:35:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Peter Yarrow was a singer-songwriter and a social activist, but he was best known as one-third of the folk-music group Peter, Paul and Mary.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to CBS News. Yarrow was 86.",
      "Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" died Tuesday in New York, Sunshine told the Associated Press. Yarrow had been battling bladder cancer for the past four years.",
      "\"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,\" his daughter Bethany said in a statement.",
      "During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles, two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.",
      "They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.",
      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.",
      "\"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\" he told The New York Times in 2019 after being disinvited from a festival over the sentence.",
      "Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\"",
      "Later songs include the civil rights anthem \"No Easy Walk to Freedom,\" co-written with Margery Tabankin, and \"Light One Candle,\" calling for peace in Lebanon.",
      "Yarrow, who with Travers and Stookey had supported Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential bid, met the Minnesota senator's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, at a campaign event. The couple married the following year. They had two children before divorcing.",
      "In addition to his ex-wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.",

      "Former \"Today\" anchor Meredith Vieira's husband, Richard Cohen, died on Christmas Eve, the show's current hosts said Tuesday. He was 76.",
      "Cohen, an Emmy Award-winning journalist who built his career as a producer at both CBS News and CNN, had lived for more than 50 years prior to his death with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. He and Vieira were married for 38 years and share three children: Benjamin Cohen, 36, Gabriel Cohen, 34, and Lily Cohen, 32.",
      "\"Today\" co-anchors Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie announced Cohen's death during Tuesday morning's episode of the NBC series. Kotb said Cohen was \"surrounded by his family and love\" when he died.",

      "Guthrie said Vieira \"was in really good spirits,\" adding that the family recently welcomed a new grandchild.",
      "The hosts shared the news of Cohen's death during a segment that paid tribute to his legacy as a journalist, author and advocate for people living with chronic illnesses. Vieira's husband was vocal about his multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including in one interview with his wife on \"Today\" in 2018, which appeared in the segment.",
      "\"I was diagnosed when I was 25 years old and essentially told there is no hope,\" said Cohen in that 2018 interview. \"Diagnosed and adios. Nothing much we can do.\"",
      "Sharing his health journey and speaking up for others became intertwined with Cohen's work, as his illness was a focal point of his 2004 autobiography, \"Blindsided: Lifting a Life Above Illness: A Reluctant Memoir,\" as well as his later writing. Cohen also survived two bouts of cancer.",
      "Cohen was celebrated on \"Today\" for his sense of humor and remembered as someone who \"lived life to the fullest.\"",
      "What is Multiple Sclerosis?",
      "Multiple sclerosis, often abbreviated M.S., is a chronic autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks itself. It targets the central nervous system and can affect the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, according\u00a0to the the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Symptoms of the illness can vary in type and severity, but, as M.S. disrupts communication between the brain and body, it can cause problems like fatigue, memory loss, mood changes, mobility issues and impaired vision. Cohen was legally blind.",
      "What causes M.S. is unknown, and why the disease manifests in some people and not others isn't clear. According to the Mayo Clinic, it's thought that genetics and environmental factors may increase an individual's risk of developing the illness.",
      "It is incurable, but there are treatments. The disease is rarely fatal, and most people diagnosed with it have a normal life expectancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Emily Mae Czachor is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com. She typically covers breaking news, extreme weather and issues involving social and criminal justice. Emily Mae previously wrote for outlets like the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed and Newsweek."

      "Chapter One",
      "The Flowering of Human Consciousness",
      "EVOCATION Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this momentous event that heralds an evolutionary transformation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower probably did not survive for long, and \ufb02owers must have remained rare and isolated phenomena, since conditions were most likely not yet favorable for a widespread \ufb02owering to occur. One day, however, a critical threshold was reached, and suddenly there would have been an explosion of color and scent all over the planet\u2014if a perceiving consciousness had been there to witness it.",
      "Much later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call \ufb02owers would come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species. Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consciousness of human beings developed, \ufb02owers were most likely the \ufb01rst thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them, that is to say, was not linked in some way to survival. They provided inspiration to countless artists, poets, and mystics. Jesus tells us to contemplate the \ufb02owers and learn from them how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a \"silent sermon\" once during which he held up a \ufb02ower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Mahakasyapa, began to smile. He is said to have been the only one who had understood the sermon. According to legend, that smile (that is to say, realization) was handed down by twenty-eight successive masters and much later became the origin of Zen.",
      "Seeing beauty in a \ufb02ower could awaken humans, however brie\ufb02y, to the beauty that is an essential part of their own innermost being, their true nature. The \ufb01rst recognition of beauty was one of the most signi\ufb01cant events in the evolution of human consciousness. The feelings of joy and love are intrinsically connected to that recognition. Without our fully realizing it, \ufb02owers would become for us an expression in form of that which is most high, most sacred, and ultimately formless within ourselves. Flowers, more \ufb02eeting, more ethereal, and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, would become like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless. They not only had a scent that was delicate and pleasing to humans, but also brought a fragrance from the realm of spirit. Using the word \"enlightenment\" in a wider sense than the conventionally accepted one, we could look upon \ufb02owers as the enlightenment of plants.",
      "Any life-form in any realm\u2014mineral, vegetable, animal, or human\u2014can be said to undergo \"enlightenment.\" It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence since it is more than an evolutionary progression: It also implies a discontinuity in its development, a leap to an entirely different level of Being and, most important, a lessening of materiality.",
      "What could be heavier and more impenetrable than a rock, the densest of all forms? And yet some rocks undergo a change in their molecular structure, turn into crystals, and so become transparent to the light. Some carbons, under inconceivable heat and pressure, turn into diamonds, and some heavy minerals into other precious stones.",
      "Most crawling reptilians, the most earthbound of all creatures, have remained unchanged for millions of years. Some, however, grew feathers and wings and turned into birds, thus defying the force of gravity that had held them for so long. They didn't become better at crawling or walking, but transcended crawling and walking entirely.",
      "Since time immemorial, \ufb02owers, crystals, precious stones, and birds have held special signi\ufb01cance for the human spirit. Like all life forms, they are, of course, temporary manifestations of the underlying one Life, one Consciousness. Their special signi\ufb01cance and the reason why humans feel such fascination for and af\ufb01nity with them can be attributed to their ethereal quality.",
      "Once there is a certain degree of Presence, of still and alert attention in human beings' perceptions, they can sense the divine life essence, the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature, every life-form, recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves. Until this happens, however, most humans see only the outer forms, unaware of the inner essence, just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form.",
      "In the case of a \ufb02ower, a crystal, precious stone, or bird, however, even someone with little or no Presence can occasionally sense that there is more there than the mere physical existence of that form, without knowing that this is the reason why he or she is drawn toward it, feels an af\ufb01nity with it. Because of its ethereal nature, its form ob- obscures the indwelling spirit to a lesser degree than is the case with other life forms. The exception to this are all newborn life forms\u2014babies, puppies, kittens, lambs, and so on. They are fragile, delicate, not yet \ufb01rmly established in materiality. An innocence, a sweetness and beauty that are not of this world still shine through them. They delight even relatively insensitive humans.",
      "So when you are alert and contemplate a \ufb02ower, crystal, or bird without naming it mentally, it becomes a window for you into the formless. There is an inner opening, however slight, into the realm of spirit. This is why these three \"en-lightened\" life forms have played such an important part in the evolution of human consciousness since ancient times; why, for example, the jewel in the lotus \ufb02ower is a central symbol of Buddhism and a white bird, the dove, signi\ufb01es the Holy Spirit in Christianity. They have been preparing the ground for a more profound shift in planetary consciousness that is destined to take place in the human species. This is the spiritual awakening that we are beginning to witness now.",
      "THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK",
      "Is humanity ready for a transformation of consciousness, an inner \ufb02owering so radical and profound that compared to it the \ufb02owering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is only a pale re\ufb02ection? Can human beings lose the density of their conditioned mind structures and become like crystals or precious stones, so to speak, transparent to the light of consciousness? Can they defy the gravitational pull of material-ism and materiality and rise above identi\ufb01cation with form that keeps the ego in place and condemns them to im- imprisonment within their own personality?",
      "The possibility of such a transformation has been the central message of the great wisdom teachings of humankind. The messengers\u2014Buddha, Jesus, and others, not all of them known\u2014were humanity's early \ufb02owers. They were precursors, rare and precious beings. A widespread \ufb02owering was not yet possible at that time, and their message became largely misunderstood and often greatly distorted. It certainly did not transform human behavior, except in a small minority of people.",
      "Is humanity more ready now than at the time of those early teachers? Why should this be so? What can you do, if anything, to bring about or accelerate this inner shift? What is it that characterizes the old egoic state of consciousness, and by what signs is the new emerging consciousness recognized? These and other essential questions will be addressed in this book. More important, this book itself is a transformational device that has come out of the arising new consciousness. The ideas and concepts presented here may be important, but they are secondary. They are no more than signposts pointing toward awakening. As you read, a shift takes place within you.",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:36:34 -0500",
    "summary": "An increasingly popular symphony orchestra concert is a screening of a movie such as \"Jaws\" accompanied by a live performance of the music\u2014reeling in new audiences to the concert hall.",
    "story": [
      "The worst way to watch \"Jaws\" is without music. A good way is to watch it with John Williams' famous score coming from your speakers. But the best way to watch \"Jaws\" might be with a live orchestra playing that iconic score.",
      "The New York Philharmonic plays for four movies a year at Lincoln Center. Almost every showing is sold out.",
      "\"A live orchestra absolutely reaches people in a way that no recorded sound can even approximate,\" said the Philharmonic's former acting CEO Deborah   Borda. \"It's like you're sitting in the middle of the orchestra.\"",
      "In the silent film days, live music always accompanied movies, and movies were events.",
      "\"Over the years, theaters got smaller,\" said Steve Linder. \"Then, people started watching it on their television. Then they watch it on their computer. Then they watch that on their phone.\"",
      "Linder is the cofounder of Film Concerts Live, one of several companies that rent out the sheet music and equipment that orchestras need to perform one of these movies. \"What we do is we bring moviegoing back to what it was originally intended to be, with live music, and in a communal experience.\"",
      "But for Borda, one of the best features of live movie scores is the way they attract new and younger audiences to the concert hall. \"Almost 50% of the people who come to our film series are first-time attendees of the New York Philharmonic, and the first time in the hall,\" she said.",
      "For the conductor, these shows are tricky. You have to keep one eye on the musicians, one eye on the score, and one eye on a special monitor running the film. But how does the conductor know exactly when to bring in the orchestra in sync with the action? That's the purpose of moving vertical bars called streamers. Those streamers and the bright dots are like countdowns to important musical moments.",
      "Anthony Parnther conducted the Philharmonic's screenings of \"Jaws.\" But his main gig is conducting the actual Hollywood recording sessions for films, such as \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "Asked if there is a feeling among his fellow conductors that such concerts are more crowd-pleasers than art, Parnther replied, \"All I know is that when I turn around from my score to address the audience, every seat is filled.\"",
      "So, how flexible is conducting a score live to a film? \"I have a little bit of license to phrase the orchestra around the streamers,\" Parnther said. \"There could be a little bit of variance. And I think that's what makes these particularly appealing for the musicians to perform and for conductors to conduct.\"",
      "These days, there are over a thousand live-orchestra movie screenings a year. The classic blockbusters usually work best, from \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Superman\" to \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
      "\"It has to be great music that the audience wants to hear, of course,\" said Linder. \"But also it has to be great music that the orchestra is interested in playing.\"",
      "Ryan Roberts is the New York Philharmonic's English horn and oboe player. Unfortunately, during the projection concerts, he sits directly under the screen, so he never gets to see any of the movies, even when he's not playing.",
      "\"But we have a few sneaky ways of watching the movie in the woodwind section,\" Roberts said. His favorite? A rearview mirror he bought on Amazon. \"We tape it right on top of our stand lights.\"",
      "And management approves of this? \"I plead the fifth!\" Roberts laughed.",
      "With the New York Philharmonic performing four performances of four films a year, which all sell out, shouldn't they do 10 performances of each film? Borda said, \"This is a symphony orchestra. We play Mahler. We play Bach. We play Mozart. We have a responsibility to the canon of music. And no, we're not a movie house; we're a symphony orchestra.\"",
      "Well, OK. But even Borda acknowledges that live-orchestra movies have become a popular and important option for American orchestras. \"We should be places that are integrated into the fabric of the community,\" she said. \"And so, we want the New York Philharmonic to be as popular as the New York Yankees or the Mets. And movies can help get us there.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "In the sweeping new period drama, Adrien Brody stars as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth, a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and seeks to rebuild his career after emigrating to America.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Brutalist\" click on the video player below:",
      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",
      "At 29, he was the youngest man to ever win the Oscar for best actor. The child of an immigrant was living his own American dream.",
      "Adrien Brody was raised in Queens, N.Y. His father, Elliot, is a retired teacher.\u00a0 His mother, Sylvia Plachy, is a photographer. \"As an only child and the son of a photographer, I was her favorite subject,\" he said. \"And so, I had a lens from a very nurturing and ever-present perspective on me. And I think that also helped as a film actor.\"",
      "\"You were comfortable in front of a camera thanks to Mom?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. Thanks to Mom.\"",
      "He dabbled in magic, calling himself \"The Amazing Adrien,\" but settled on acting by middle school. At 13, he landed a leading role as a rebellious orphan in a made-for-TV movie, \"Home at Last.\" \u00a0\"I remember thinking how I never wanted it to end,\" he said. \"And that sense of joy that I get from it in that immersion, it's never gone away.\"",
      "Brody aged into a mohawked punk rocker in Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam.\" He's carried a blockbuster like \"King Kong,\" and shown some whimsy in his five films with director Wes Anderson, including \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The French Dispatch.\"",
      "Anderson, said Brody, \"has given me a lot of opportunity to do comedic work, more overtly comedic stuff, which at the time when we started working together, I think people just thought I was a serious actor.\"",
      "\"The Brutalist\" is a return to his serious side, and maybe a reminder that, as an artist, Adrien Brody is up for anything. \"It's a nice moment right now,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"When you're not working, what makes you happy?\"",
      "\"Lots of things. I need to be creatively immersed. So, that may be fulfilled through cooking, through painting, through making music. I'm a pretty good cook.\"",
      "\"What do you make?\"",
      "\"I mean, hot dogs,\" he laughed. \"What do you like? You tell me what would you like? I can whip something up. You can come over one day, come see the artwork. I'll whip up something to eat. I can make some good cocktails.\"",
      "\"You're a mixologist as well?\"",
      "\"Oh, I can hook it up.\"",
      "\"Okay. What can you not do?\"",

    "story": [
      "\"I've spent quite a lot of my life over the last 15 years in the really honored, privileged position of being close to people who are reaching the end of their lives,\" said actress Tilda Swinton. \"And then to make a film about it is a blessing on a blessing, really.\"",
      "Drawing on those experiences helped Swinton earn an acting nomination for Sunday's Golden Globes. In \"The Room Next Door,\" she portrays a woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Her character, Martha, faces questions about how to live. \"My first 'Martha,' if you like, was Derek Jarman,\" she said. The director, artist and gay activist (who cast Swinton in her first film, \"Caravaggio\"), was diagnosed with HIV in 1986.",
      "The Oscar-winner credits Jarman with finding her a home in cinema, and showing her how collaborative filmmaking could be. They made seven feature films together before his death, in 1994.",
      "She said, \"He modeled a kind of attitude to his dismount that I drew on, like, to my core, for myself, and in fact I have reflected in the portrait of Martha.\"",
      "I asked, \"You think about specific people as you're acting?\"",
      "\"Well, an attitude, yeah, that I've seen played out, that I've witnessed \u2013 my parents, my children's beloved father, John Byrne, who died last year,\" she replied. \"It's been such a privilege to be in that hot seat beside them and seeing them face the inevitable with such dignity and humor and wit, and just power.\"",
      "\"The Room Next Door\" is the first English-language feature film by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Swinton's co-star, Julianne Moore, is another Academy Award-winner. \"He asked me who I wanted,\" said Swinton. \"It was her face that I saw at the end of the bed. It was her listening face that I felt was the right face.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Room Next Door\" click on the video player below:",
      "Swinton has made more than 80 films, winning an Oscar for the 2007 \"Michael Clayton.\" Still, she says the big studio productions are the exception. She veers toward independent films, thriving in the experimental.",
      "Asked about the expressiveness of her eyes, and of how much she can \"say\" without saying anything, Swinton said, \"I suppose I started in silent cinema with Derek Jarman. I actually prefer silent cinema.\"",
      "Why? \"I loved it first,\" she said. \"And then when I started working with Derek, I found my comfort zone in front of a silent camera. I think it's a very rare screenplay that is able to approach what I'm really interested in, which is inarticulacy. Even now, I sort of know what I want to say to you, but I can't pull the words out my ear, and they're coming out a little wrong.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you say it with your eyes?\"",
      "\"That's what I'm really interested in!\" she laughed.",
      "She's played a tortured mother in \"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\" and she's not exactly cuddly in the Almod\u00f2var film. But just before our interview, joking about some fabulous boots she was wearing, we glimpsed another side of Swinton.",
      "I asked, \"You've done a lot of films, but you can seem so serious \u2026 Like this? Not at all. There is a curiosity and a warmth, and you jump out.\"",
      "\"The jumping out, I get. The seriousness, I am a little confused by.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I am always doing comedy,\" she said. \"I feel everything I do is funny. But I think maybe because I'm a shy person and I don't tend to smile with my teeth all over the place, there's has been an assumption that there was more seriousness than nonsense, but there is a hell of a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "\"You're a shy person?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"You picked a tough career for that!\"",
      "\"I know! It's strange, isn't it? But I think what makes me most shy is being singled out.\"",
      "So, when she's alone on the red carpet, she finds that ensemble approach through fashion.\u00a0 \"It's very playful. My relationship with fashion is entirely dependent on my relationship with certain individuals who are my friends, who happen to be some of the greatest designers in the world, who give me clothes. And that makes going out into a public arena when you are someone who is not an extrovert, not only much easier, but actually possible.\"",
      "When we met in Paris. Swinton had just flown in from a trip to China for Chanel. She was wearing a military coat: \"I first fell in love with my father's uniforms. My mother was always in some nice silk dress, but I was really interested in my father's uniform.\"",
      "Swinton grew up the daughter of a military officer in an aristocratic family in Scotland. When we met, Swinton was looking forward to getting home to her remote seaside town in Scotland, where she raised twins, and has an artist-partner, Sandro Kopp, and a number of springer spaniels.",
      "I asked about descriptions of her as \"an icon of androgynous beauty,\" and naturally radiating \"a certain otherworldliness.\"",
      "\"The otherworldliness does make me laugh a bit,\" she said, \"because the truth is I look like the members of my family. I think the otherworldly might have something to do with the fact that I don't wear mascara and I'm very pale. As my grandmother would say, it would be a dull world if everybody felt the same. I don't feel otherworldly. I feel very much present.\"",
      "Swinton is very much present, whether at an interview or as an actor. And in navigating Hollywood, those roots in Scotland help her find balance.",
      "\"Maybe it's made me braver,\" she said. \"Maybe I wouldn't be able to pack that small bag and engage in worlds that are very alien to where I come from, if I didn't know I was going home to something that feels absolutely real to me.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 10:12:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 09:35:36 -0500",
    "summary": "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu in the first death in the U.S. caused by the H5N1 virus.",
    "story": [
      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",
      "The hospitalized child in Canada initially had conjunctivitis and fever before later developing cough, vomiting and diarrhea. She was later intubated after respiratory failure.",

      "Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.",
      "HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.",
      "HMPV infections are reportedly surging in China, drawing interest around the world, but Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, director of infection prevention and control at the Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told CBS News this week that there was no concern over a potential new pandemic.",
      "\"This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity,\" she said, adding that the virus was fairly stable, unlike the COVID-19 virus that mutates often, making it harder to fight.",
      "India's federal government asked states on Monday to step up surveillance of respiratory illnesses and spread awareness about how to prevent the transmission of HMPV. Preventive measures include covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, frequent handwashing, and wearing masks in crowded places.",
      "\"Health experts have clarified that the HMPV is not a new virus; it was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world for many years,\" Indian Health Minister J. P. Nadda said Monday. \"The health systems and surveillance networks of the country are vigilant and there is no reason to worry.\"",
      "Nadda said the people infected in India had no recent travel history and that the government was \"closely monitoring the situation in China and neighboring countries.\"",
      "The Health Ministry also said the HMPV infections were \"no cause of concern,\" as there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses detected in the country, and it noted that India was well prepared for any surge should it occur.",
      "\"The virus infection is usually a mild and self-limiting condition and most cases recover on their own,\" the ministry said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is for the first time setting guidelines for levels of lead in processed baby foods such as jarred fruits and vegetables.",
      "Part of an effort to reduce exposure to a toxic metal that causes developmental and neurological issues in children, the action announced on Monday offers only voluntary \u2014 not mandatory \u2014 limits for food manufacturers. But the agency can take enforcement action if it finds foods that surpass its recommended limits.",
      "The FDA guidance caps lead levels for children younger than 2 at 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings, and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals.",
      "The directive covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes. By contrast, the new limits don't cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, despite some research indicating the products have higher levels of lead. It also doesn't limit other metals like cadmium that have been found in baby foods.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

    "story": [
      "The army of firefighters battling the massive\u00a0Southern California wildfires includes workers who could otherwise remain safely behind bars.",
      "As of Thursday, 783 prison inmates have been deployed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to help contain the blazes, the department confirmed to CBS News. The crews of incarcerated firefighters are embedded with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) to assist its nearly 2,000 firefighters.",
      "The imprisoned firefighters volunteer to participate in CDCR's Conservation (Fire) Camps Program and are paid for their work. Participants supports state, local and federal government agencies when they respond to natural disasters.",
      "CDCR operates 35 so-called fire camps across 25 different California counties. Two of the camps are for incarcerated women. They are minimum-security facilities staffed with correctional personnel who supervise camp participants 24 hours per day.",
      "The department says inmates work cutting fire lines and removing fuel from behind structures to help slow fires' spread. They can also serve in support roles at the camps, including cooking, laundry and water treatment plant operation.",
      "Participation in the camps is voluntary, and those who join in must be deemed physically and mentally fit. Additionally, they must have no more than eight years remaining on their sentences. Convictions for rape and other sex offenses, as well as for murder, arson and some other serious crimes, disqualifies an inmate from participating.",
      "How much do incarcerated firefighters make?",
      "Imprisoned firefighters' pay depends on their skill level. They earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to CDCR, which pays their wages. Wage levels doubled in 2023, up from between $2.90 and $5.12 per day.",
      "Inmates in the program also earn supplemental pay while responding to emergencies. Cal Fire pays an additional $1 an hour, regardless of firefighters' skill level. And when crews work a 24-hour shift, followed by a 24-hour period of rest, the lowest-skilled firefighter would earn $26.90 in a day.",
      "Additionally, camp participants earn time credits toward their sentences. Specifically, most earn two additional days off their sentences for every day served on a fire crew.",
      "Camp participants are eligible for employment with Cal Fire once they have served their sentences, a path many choose to take, according to CDCR. The department says some of these individuals have successfully transitioned to roles with Cal Fire, the U.S. Forest Service, and interagency hotshot crews.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, the\u00a0fires\u00a0had scorched more than 45 square miles across the Los Angeles area. At least five people are dead, and more than 179,000 Los Angelenos were under evacuation orders, according to officials.",

      "As deadly\u00a0wildfires engulf swaths\u00a0of Los Angeles County, forcing nearly 200,000 people from their houses, a still-to-be known number of residents will be contending with insurance claims to recoup losses and rebuild or repair their homes. For those looking to be treated fairly and paid for damage and destruction to their property, speaking up and doing advance research is crucial, experts and consumer advocates say.",
      "The good news? Unlike with\u00a0flooding, a standard homeowners' policy covers destruction and damage caused by fire, including wildfires, and a\u00a0standard renters' insurance policy covers the renter's personal belongings, according to the Insurance Information Institute.",
      "The optional comprehensive part of a standard auto insurance policy covers vehicles against damage caused by fire and falling objects. Approximately 75% of U.S. drivers opt to buy it.",

      "When and how to file a claim",
      "Triple-I advises the following\u00a0steps to begin filing a claim:",
      "Contact your insurance carrier or agent as soon as possible to begin the claim-filing process, and make sure to ask about requirements and deadlines. Many insurers have a mobile app where you can file a claim.",
      "Take photos of damaged items (if it is safe to do so) and don't discard damaged items until your assigned insurance adjuster has completed their assessment.",
      "Keep all receipts for out-of-pocket expenses, such as temporary lodging.",
      "Things to know and watch out for",
      "Many property owners hit with large and total losses learn the hard way that they are not fully insured. The issue is so common that United Policyholders has an entire section on its website devoted to underinsurance help. \"Many property owners have succeeded in getting the coverage they thought they had but didn't, but many have given up. Insurers count on you giving up,\" according to the nonprofit organization that advocates for policyholders of all types.",
      "Fires that damage but don't completely destroy one's home create their own insurance claim issues, according to United Policyholders. Things to watch out for include hidden damage from water, smoke, ash and mold. Air quality and ducts should also be considered. \"Repairs should return your property to a 'uniform and consistent appearance' even if that means replacing undamaged items such as roof tiles or carpeting,\" it stated.",
      "People living in seemingly unscathed residences alongside homes that burned down should still have their place inspected for possible structural and other damage from extreme heat, smoke or fire retardant. \"If your insurer refuses to conduct or pay for proper inspections, ask again in writing; politely remind them of their legal duty to thoroughly investigate all damage, including hidden damage. If a dispute arises, it's worth finding and paying for your own inspection by an independent reputable specialist,\" United Policyholders said.",
      "Smoke damage is a covered peril in most policies, with disputes often arising over cleaning or replacing exposed items.",
      "Extreme heat and smoke kills most plants and may contaminate soil. Keep your claim open for at least six months and file supplemental claims if necessary, as damaged plants may not die right away. Coverage for landscaping replacement is typically a set amount or percentage of your dwelling coverage. The losses are frequently only partially covered. \"Mature trees can be valued as high as $5,000 yet many policies contact a $500 per tree limit.\"",
      "Another thing to keep in mind: Unreimbursed losses can offset your tax obligations when you claim as a casualty loss deduction.",
      "If one believes they are being treated poorly by their insurance company, the California Department of Insurance has an online\u00a0form that homeowners can use to file complaints.",
      "Steps in preparing to evacuate",
      "For those told to evacuate due to the wildfires, do so immediately. For those preparing to evacuate, here are some tips from United Policyholders:",
      "1. Document your home and possessions. Take pictures or a video of each room and the outside of your house. Build as much of an inventory as time permits including furnishings, artwork, jewelry and appliances. \"After a traumatic loss, it's impossible to remember everything you had, so most people never collect their full insurance benefits,\" United Policyholders noted.",
      "2. Pack important documents:",

If your home is not damaged and your temporary living expenses are modest, keep in mind that filing a claim goes on your record and can hike your insurance costs.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 14:32:00 -0500",
    "summary": "About 1,600 policies for Pacific Palisades homeowners were dropped by State Farm in July, the state insurance office says.",
    "story": [
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades Fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an Thursday email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis of insurance data by CBS San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, State Farm said, \"Our No. 1 priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "State Farm's decision reflects a trend of private insurers, including\u00a0Allstate\u00a0and Farmers Insurance, of dropping California policies or halting underwriting, leaving homeowners with the choice of getting coverage through the insurer of last resort, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan, or forgo insurance altogether. The FAIR Plan provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not.",
      "As a result, homeowners in Pacific Palisades had increasingly shifted to the FAIR Plan, with roughly 1,400 of the town's 9,000 homes covered by the plan in 2024, more than quadruple the number in 2020, according to data from the insurer. In other words, prior to the disaster, about 1 in 7 homeowners were reliant on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The Palisades Fire could become the costliest wildfire in history because of the number of buildings that have been destroyed and as the structures rank among the nation's most expensive homes, said Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist, on a Wednesday webcast about the disaster. The neighborhood's 9,000 residential units have a median home value of $3.1 million,\u00a0according to real estate data firm ATTOM Data.",
      "While personally and financially devastating to homeowners, the Los Angeles fires \u2014 which include the Eaton Fire and several other wildfires \u2014 are likely to place added stress on the state's already fragile insurance market, experts and lawmakers say. It's an issue that extends beyond California, with similar issues facing homeowners in Florida, Louisiana and other states.",
      "\"We will be watching to see whether the collapse of a trembling home insurance market accelerates after this added shock,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, wrote on X Thursday. Whitehouse serves on the Senate Budget Committee, which last month issued a report\u00a0about climate change's impact on the insurance market.",
      "In California, State Farm last year said it was discontinuing coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments in the state. Since 2019, more than 100,000 Californians have lost their insurance, according to a San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0analysis of insurance data.",
      "\"A full-scale financial crisis\"",
      "With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the insurance industry is grappling with a new calculus amid rising costs and risks. That's prompting some insurers to decide not to renew insurance policies in counties that are most at risk from climate risks \u2014 and it's not only within California and the other usual suspects, the Senate report found.",
      "\"The data confirm that it is climate change that is driving increasing non-renewal rates,\" it noted. \"Second, the data reveal that Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas are not the only places experiencing spiking non-renewal rates and increasing premiums.\"",
      "Other regions facing rising non-renewal rates are Southern New England, the Carolinas, New Mexico and counties in the Northern Rockies, Oklahoma, and Hawaii, the report found.",
      "The issue isn't just local. \"This is predicted to cascade into plunging property values in communities where insurance becomes impossible to find or prohibitively expensive \u2014 a collapse in property values with the potential to trigger a full-scale financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008,\" the report stressed.",
      "\"Here's how it works: Climate change makes risk unpredictable; risk makes insurance unaffordable or unavailable; no insurance makes mortgages unavailable; without mortgages property values crash; cascading like 2008 into general economy,\" Whitehouse wrote Thursday on X.",
      "FAIR Plan",
      "Still, there's some potential for near-term relief. Homeowners in California could get help from a new state regulation, announced Monday, that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.",
      "The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the FAIR Plan, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said. The average cost of insurance on the FAIR Plan is about $3,200, or more than double the typical homeowner's cost in California, according to Bankrate.",
      "The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, they'd need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said.",
      "In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office.",
      "Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Lara said in a statement.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 14:22:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok\u200b in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

      "In a 2023 podcast, Long talked about his work with a firm called Lifetime Advisors, where he helped promote the ERTC to businesses, although Warren's letter notes that the podcast appears to have been \"pulled down from multiple podcast platforms, including the Listen Notes website, Apple, Spotify and YouTube.\"",
      "In the podcast, which CBS MoneyWatch listened to in December before it was taken down, Long said qualifying for credit was difficult during its first iteration, but that he helped make it easier for businesses to be eligible while he was in Congress.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "In the letter, Warren asks Long to provide information about his work with the ERTC, including whether any returns he had worked on claiming the credit have been challenged by the IRS. Among the senator's other queries are whether Long directed anyone to pull down the 2023 podcast, and how he earned the designation of \"certified tax & business adviser,\" a term that he has used to describe himself on his X profile.",
      "\"Although you bill yourself as a 'Certified Business and Tax Adviser,' this certification appears to only require a three-day training,\" Warren noted. \"There is no record of you on the IRS' database of tax return preparers \u2014 a searchable directory that lists individuals who hold credentials recognized by the IRS \u2014 nor do you appear in the Missouri Board of Accountancy database.\"",

      "For their part, port operators and shipping companies argued that the U.S. is falling behind automated ports like those in Dubai, Rotterdam and Singapore.",
      "The stakes were high for the U.S. economy. Ports on the East and Gulf coasts handle more than half the nation's traffic in shipping containers, the steel boxes at the center of world trade, which carry everything from smartphones to fresh fruit to automobiles.",

      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",

      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office\u00a0report. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",

      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans continue to grapple with IRS delays that are preventing them from getting their tax refunds in a timely manner, according to a new report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent watchdog that's part of the IRS.",
      "The report, published annually to highlight the IRS' most glaring problems, comes after the agency was given billions in new funding through the Inflation Reduction Act to improve its technology and go after wealthy tax cheats. Yet for many taxpayers, dealing with the IRS involves \"delays, frustration and unnecessary costs,\" the taxpayer advocate, Erin M. Collins, wrote in the report.",
      "Problems highlighted in the report echo issues that bedeviled millions of taxpayers during the pandemic, when the IRS shuttered its offices, causing many returns to get caught in a bottleneck, delaying refunds. While the worst of those issues have since been resolved, Collins noted, the IRS continues to struggle in some areas, such as processing paper returns and dealing with taxpayers who have been victims of identity theft, which can lead to lengthy refund delays.",
      "\"Notwithstanding the improvements I have described, taxpayers continue to face challenges in their dealings with the IRS,\" she wrote.",
      "The nearly $80 billion in funding from the IRA has helped the tax agency hire more workers, some of whom have bulked up its customer service support. But almost $6 out of every $10 of the new funding is directed toward enforcement, or boosting audits of wealthy tax cheats and businesses that skirt tax laws, the report noted.",
      "\"I have previously criticized this extreme imbalance in funding priorities,\" Collins wrote in the report, noting that she believes more money should be directed toward taxpayer services, an IRS unit that helps taxpayers with questions, problems and other dilemmas that arise.",
      "The IRS has already made improvements in some of the areas underscored by Collins, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The NTA report also acknowledges the progress the IRS has made, which Werfel said demonstrates \"what a well-funded IRS can do.\"",
      "\"It's important to continue that momentum because we recognize the agency's work isn't done \u2014not by a long shot,\" he said. \"It's vital that the IRS continue this progress to better serve taxpayers and the nation.\"",
      "Here's who is facing tax refund delays",
      "Collins reiterated one of her earlier\u00a0criticisms\u00a0of the IRS: That paper returns are the agency's \"kryptonite.\" Unfortunately, she said in her most recent return, the IRS continues to receive more than 10 million income tax returns on paper each year \u2014 while it also gets another 75 million paper forms from taxpayers.",
      "While the IRS has made progress in processing paper returns, it's still not up to snuff, she noted. Processing paper returns can still take months for the IRS to complete, she added.",
      "And many people who e-file also face delays if their 1040s are rejected, an issue that impacted 18 million taxpayers in fiscal year 2024, or 12% percent of returns, her report noted. These rejections can happen for issues like a PIN that doesn't match the prior year's return, or an adjusted gross income number that doesn't match up from the prior year.",
      "\"[M]ost rejected returns are valid, requiring taxpayers to jump through additional hoops to resubmit their returns electronically or submit the returns on paper,\" she wrote. \"Most taxpayers receive refunds, and delays in processing both paper-filed and e-filed returns translate into refund delays.\"",
      "People who have been victims of identity theft are another group that often face delays in getting resolution. About half a million taxpayers are still trying to their their issues fixed, although it took the IRS about 22 months on average to resolve the cases and send refunds to the victims, she added.",
      "That can be stressful for taxpayers waiting for their refunds, but it also creates an additional cost to the federal government, which must pay interest on overpayments it doesn't refund on a timely basis, the report pointed out.",
      "Some businesses, meanwhile, are facing delays due to the Employee Retention Credit, a tax benefit created in the pandemic to help businesses stay afloat. But the IRS has\u00a0flagged the ERC as vulnerable to fraud, leading to delays in processing returns.",
      "The IRS is \"still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024\" for returns that claimed the Employee Retention Credit, the report said. \"Although its aim was to minimize the payment of ineligible claims, there have been lengthy delays in the payment of eligible claims submitted by employers that, in some cases, are depending on ERC refunds to remain in business.\"",
      "When does tax filing open in 2025?",
      "Tax filing typically begins at the end of January, although the IRS hasn't yet announced when it will start accepting all returns.",
      "Some taxpayers can start filing on Jan. 10, however, the IRS said on Tuesday. That's because its Free File service will start accepting returns on Friday, it noted.",
      "The IRS Free File program, which is offered through tax software companies, is available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024.",

      "Check the source",
      "Does the person or publication sharing the information have a track record of sharing reliable information? If not, take a closer look.",
      "Check your emotions",

      "Check the date",
      "On social media, photos and videos can be reshared long after an event takes place. So even if it's your first time seeing it, it doesn't mean a post is new. After looking into the source, it's crucial to look beyond the headline and check the original publication date to make sure what you're seeing is current.",

Be sure to open articles to read more about when and how events took place. Check the location to make sure it's accurate.",
      "Cross-check the information",
      "It's helpful to have more than one source of information for any story you come across, especially when something seems questionable.

      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",
      "Community trust",
      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",

      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",

    "story": [
      "Unpaid medical bills will no longer appear on credit reports, where they can block people from getting mortgages, car loans or small business loans, according to a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule will remove $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, according to the bureau, which means lenders will no longer be able to take that into consideration when deciding whether to issue a loan.",
      "The change is estimated to raise the credit scores by an average of 20 points and could lead to 22,000 additional mortgages being approved every year, according to the bureau.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement announcing the rule that it would be \"lifechanging\" for millions of families, \"making it easier for them to be approved for a car loan, a home loan, or a small-business loan. ... Our historic rule will help more Americans save money, build wealth, and thrive.\"",
      "\"No one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or experienced a medical emergency,\" she said.",
      "But, the Reuters news agency points out, Tuesday's announcement came despite demands from Republicans in Congress that the Biden administration stop issuing new rules with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office. That means he or his congressional allies may try to reverse the ban.",
      "\"Though Team Trump is likely to try to freeze or reverse these actions, it is not guaranteed,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report. \"Trump 2.0 is more populist than in 2017, which is why undoing a ban on including medical debt on credit reports or dropping an enforcement action against a credit bureau may not be a priority.\"",
      "Harris also announced that states and local governments have used a sweeping 2021 pandemic-era aid package to eliminate more than $1 billion in medical debt for more than 700,000 Americans.",

      "\"When consumers disputed errors on their credit reports, Experian conducted sham investigations rather than properly reviewing the disputes as required by federal law,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"Credit reporting errors can have serious consequences for a family's finances, and it is critical that credit reporting giants follow the law.\"",
      "Specifically, the CFPB alleges that Experian is harming people by using faulty procedures in receiving information in handling consumer disputes. The company \"routinely and uncritically accepts the original furnisher's response to the disputed information, even when the response was improbable or illogical on its face, or when Experian has other information available that suggests the furnisher is unreliable.\" Experian then fails to inform consumers of its findings, and instead offers confusing and incorrect information, CFPB stated.",
      "Further, Experian reinserts inaccurate information into credit reports because it fails to match newly reported information with records of previously deleted information. Those who disputed the accuracy of an account and thought their report had been corrected instead see the same false information reappear without explanation, the agency found.",
      "The CFPB's lawsuit, filed in a U.S. District Court in California, seeks to stop the company's unlawful conduct and a civil money penalty, which would be paid into the agency's victims relief fund.",
      "Experian dismissed the agency's lawsuit as \"completely without merit\" and said it would prevail in court.",

      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Health Care, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

    "summary": "Only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis within three years, a report found.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Adams was researching health insurance options in 2023, he had one very specific requirement: coverage for prosthetic limbs.",
      "Adams, 51, lost his right leg to cancer 40 years ago, and he has worn out more legs than he can count. He picked a gold plan on the Colorado health insurance marketplace that covered prosthetics, including microprocessor-controlled knees like the one he has used for many years. That function adds stability and helps prevent falls.",
      "But when his leg needed replacing last January after about five years of everyday use, his new marketplace health plan wouldn't authorize it. The roughly $50,000 leg with the electronically controlled knee wasn't medically necessary, the insurer said, even though Colorado law leaves that determination up to the patient's doctor, and his has prescribed a version of that leg for many years, starting when he had employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "Coverage disparity among plans",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity.\u00a0In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "An estimated\u00a02.3 million\u00a0people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a health care consulting company. That number is expected to as much as\u00a0double\u00a0in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "\"Insurance fairness\" laws",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about\u00a0half\u00a0of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following three years.",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric\u00a0hand\u00a0she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said."

      "Deborah Garcia, whose husband David also died in the World Trade Center, said she had hoped for the finality of a judgment that would be settled by the plea agreements, \"because if these guys die (now), they die innocent.\"",
      "Garcia is here with her son Dylan, whose 28th birthday was Thursday and was just 4 years old when his father died.",

      "She added that she had hoped this visit would bring her mother \"some sense of resolution after all of these years.\" She said she was glad to have come to support Freund, but \"this is not the ending to this trip that I thought we would be experiencing together.\"",
      "Soon after the plea agreements were reached,\u00a0Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u00a0tried to revoke them, arguing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the decision, he alone should have the power to approve the plea deals, rather than the subordinate authority who accepted the deals.",
      "The judge in the 9/11 case and then a military appeals court ruled against Austin and said he had weighed in too late. Austin has since reiterated that he still feels he should be the person who makes the decision on the 9/11 plea deals. On Thursday, during a trip to Germany, Austin was asked again about his decision to revoke the deals.",
      "\"I've stated where I am on this, and I haven't changed,\" he replied. \"We are in the process of appealing that ruling, and since we are appealing, I don't have any comment.\"",

      "The Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch effort by lawyers for President-elect Donald Trump to forestall his sentencing for his New York criminal conviction.",
      "The five justice majority that voted to deny Trump's application wrote that the evidentiary issues Trump has complained about \"can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal.\"",
      "They also noted that the judge overseeing Trump's New York case has signaled he will not sentence Trump to serve any time in jail, writing \"the burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court's stated intent to impose a sentence of 'unconditional discharge' after a brief virtual hearing.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch would have granted Trump's application for a postponement of sentencing, the majority wrote.",
      "The incoming president sought an emergency reprieve from the nation's highest court after the New York judge who oversaw Trump's trial on Jan. 3 sent the president-elect hurtling toward the long-delayed sentencing.",
      "New York Justice Juan Merchan rejected Trump's latest motions to dismiss the case, and set aside his conviction, which argued a president-elect is entitled to the same protections from criminal proceedings as a president. Trump, who railed against the case for years, also said evidence shown at trial that related to his first presidency violated that same constitutional immunity.",
      "New York prosecutors objected to any further delay of the sentencing hearing, which has now been scheduled four times since Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.",
      "They noted in multiple filings this week that Merchan already telegraphed his sentencing decision on Jan. 3, when he said he was inclined to release Trump without incarceration or any other restriction.",
      "In May, a unanimous jury found Trump guilty for authorizing a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a so-called \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star. The payment was made before Trump's first election in 2016, but Trump signed off on the reimbursements to his former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen \u2014 and an accompanying coverup \u2014 during his time in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump says it was unconstitutional for the jury to see evidence and hear testimony from the years when he was in the White House.",
      "Trump's lawyers urged the Supreme Court to prevent his sentencing, set for just 10 days before his inauguration, \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.\"",
      "The case has wound its way to the Supreme Court repeatedly since Manhattan prosecutors began their investigation in 2018. In a landmark 2020 decision, the court ruled that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records. Trump continued to fight their release even after that decision, until 2021, when the Supreme Court again rejected his efforts to shield the financial records.",
      "Merchan gave Trump the option of attending the sentence via video, as opposed to in-person, and prosecutors said in court filings and arguments this week that he has said he will take the virtual appearance option.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

The president also said he'll be asking Congress for more funding to help.",

Mr. Biden said he's surging all federal resources possible to Southern California, including 400 federal firefighters and 30 federal firefighting planes, among other assets.",
      "\"I told the governor and local officials, spare no expense,\" Mr. Biden said, calling the damage \"catastrophic.\"",
      "The 100% disaster response coverage from the federal government for the next 180 days is an increase from the current 75% the president previously allotted, and more than the 90% Mr. Biden said California Gov. Gavin Newsom requested. The damage is expected to be one of the most expensive disasters in California history. Three fires are still raging, the president said, and 179,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes.",
      "Congress may need to pass supplemental funding to buoy rebuilding efforts, and the president urged Congress to \"step up.\"",

      "\"We are literally waiting to see which way the wind blows,\" she said.",
      "The president also said he has a family member who lives in the affected area, and that family member said more than 200 homes in the neighborhood have burned. The president didn't reveal the identity of that family member.",
      "Multiple fires have so far killed at least five people, leveling homes and scorching vegetation and wildlife in their wake. The Palisades fire along the coast is the largest one, followed by a fire in Pasadena further inand.",
      "Officials Thursday said more than 1,300 structures have burned, with 60,000 structures threatened, as the blazes burn largely uncontained in densely populated and expensive neighborhoods of Southern California.",
      "Mr. Biden was supposed to speak in Thermal, California, earlier this week, but his remarks were canceled due to excessive high winds. He was briefed on the fires while in California instead. The president canceled a trip to Italy to see Pope Francis and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni this week so he could focus on the federal response to the blazes.",
      "The president approved Newsom's request for a presidential major disaster declaration, freeing up federal resources to support the response.",
      "U.S. Forest Service air tankers and 10 federal firefighting helicopters are working to cut off the fires, and the Forest Service has positioned dozens of fire engines, the White House said Wednesday. The Pentagon has also readied firefighting personnel and capabilities. Hurricane-force\u00a0Santa Ana winds, dry conditions and a lack of sufficient water have fueled the fires. High winds are expected into Friday.",
      "The president was briefed on the latest about the fires and response to them Thursday before the late President Jimmy Carter's funeral.",
      "Asked if he believes the next administration will give California the aid it needs, the president responded, \"I pray to God they will.\"",

The bill marks the first policy legislation of the new Congress, and the House approved it in a bipartisan vote of its own on Tuesday.",

      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "story": [
      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0Former president Jimmy Carter's vice president, Walter Mondale,\u00a0died in 2021\u00a0but left behind a eulogy that his son Ted read at Carter's memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington Thursday morning.",
      "The eulogy \u2014 which Walter Mondale was believed to have written in 2015 after Carter, who was 90 years old at the time, announced he had brain cancer \u2014 touched on how some issues Carter and his Vice President faced were ahead of their time.",
      "\"The most was climate change. Yeah, I mean Carter staked his presidency on environmental regulation, on deregulation of industries, on conservation,\" Ted Mondale said.",
      "The eulogy also alluded to the relationship Carter and Walter Mondale shared post-presidency. Walter Mondale wrote that, \"unlike a lot of vice presidents and their presidents, our relationship did not blow up.\"",
      "Read the full transcript of Walter Mondale's eulogy below:",
      "\"Today we join in sadness to honor our dear friend, President Carter, for his extraordinary years of principled and decent leadership, his courageous commitment to civil rights and human rights. I think we all remember that day when then-Governor Carter made his famous inaugural address and for the first time a Georgia Governor called for a commitment to the traditions of Martin Luther King and for the decency that his leadership stood for over Dr. King's lifetime.",
      "\"I was surprised when then-candidate Gov. Carter asked me to join him as his running mate in 1976. He amazed me then as he has every year since and following his presidency. He, of course, was brilliant, as we all know. He had a great sense of humor. While we had only 4 years in the White House, he achieved so much in that time. It stood as a marker for Americans dedicated to justice and decency. Today we come to say goodbye to our friend and to deeply thank his partner, Rosalynn, who is with us today. God bless you Rosalynn.",
      "\"Carter was a man of his word. I remember when we talked about his concept of the vice presidency. I told him that I would like to do it and I had only two requests. I wanted to make a real contribution and didn't want to be embarrassed or humiliated as many of my predecessors had been in that office. He agreed, welcomed my full participation, directed his staff to treat me as they would him and, during our 4 years in the White House, he was very careful to protect me from the frustration and too often humiliation that had cursed the lives of many vice presidents. These were good years for Joan and me. Because of that, I want to thank the President for the good choices he made of his key personnel, key advisors and political leaders. We don't have time to mention many of them but Stu Eizenstat comes as close as humanly possible to rivaling President Carter's formidable work ethic. Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell were blessings every day during my time in the White House.",
      "\"One of the things that dawned on me during the course of our time together in the White House is how well we seemed to work together and how we seemed to understand each other and how, unlike a lot of vice presidents and their presidents, our relationship did not blow up. I think one ofthe realities was that Carter was a devout Christian who grew up, as we know, in a small town and was active in his faith for almost every moment of his life. I was also a small-town kid and I grew up in our small Methodist church where my Dad was the preacher and our faith was very basic to me as Carter's faith was to him. That created a bond between us that allowed us to understand each other and to find ways to work together because ofour common commitment to our faith.",
      "\"Joan loved her time as the second lady and we have Jimmy and Rosalynn to thank for helping her champion the public arts while we were together and for being so kind to her. With his leadership, we created the model vice presidency, a real partnership between the President and the Vice President. Working together, we did change how my office acted to provide new levels of support to his presidency. We became very close friends. We often spent hours together throughout the day. We were working on real problems, not wasting time. That model vice presidency that Carter helped create has been followed in one way or another by later administrations of both parties. Our personal relationship we established while we were in office continued throughout our lives. He allowed me to take a leadership role on issues that never would have been allowed before. I worked in a central role in trying to bring decency to the Vietnamese and Southeast Asian boat people who were fleeing their countries. With President Carter's orders, the boat people were picked up by our great Navy from their flimsy boats which were capsizing and took them to safety. Most became good American citizens working for a healthy and prosperous nation. Compare this to how we are tragically dealing with the crisis of immigrants today.",
      "\"Carter was farsighted. He put aside his short-term political interests to tackle challenges that demanded sacrifice to protect our kids and grandkids from harm one or two decades out. Very few people in the 1970's had heard the term \"climate change\". Yet Carter put his presidency on the line to pass laws to conserve energy, deregulate new oil and gas prices and invest in clean, renewable solar, wind and geothermal alternatives to fossil fuels. It wasn't a perfect program but, thanks to Carter, U.S. energy consumption declined 10% between 1979 and 1983. In many ways, he laid the foundation for future presidents to come to grips with climate change. Some thought he was crazy to fight so hard to pass these bills, but he was dead right.",
      "\"All of us know President Carter elevated human rights to the top of his agenda but sometimes we forget how seriously he pushed to advance the rights of women. He proposed and signed the law extending the period for states to approve the Equal Rights Amendment, which now, finally, has been ratified by three quarters of the states. He appointed women to head the Departments of Commerce, Education, HEW and HUD. Women on his White House staff played crucial roles in developing his highest priority energy and environmental proposals and laws deregulating our oil and gas, trucking and airline industries. And he dramatically increased the ranks of female circuit and district court judges, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In all he appointed five times as many women to the federal bench as all of his predecessors combined.",
      "\"Two decades ago, President Carter said he believed income inequality was the biggest global issue. Two years ago, in a speech in Lynchburg, he said \"I think now... it is the discrimination against women and girls in the world,\" including the brutal killing of female infants, sexual abuse, human trafficking, honor killings and the rest. He concluded that, until the stubborn attitudes that foster discrimination against women change, the world cannot advance and poverty and income inequality cannot be solved.",
      "\"Amen!",
      "\"Toward the end of our time in the White House, the President and I were talking about how we might describe what we tried to do. We came up with this sentence which to me remains an important summary of what we were trying to do. \"We told the truth, we obeyed the law and we kept the peace.\" That we did, Mr. President. I will always be proud and grateful to have had the chance to work with you toward these noble ends. It was then and always will be the most rewarding experience of my public career.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 08:51:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department told a federal appeals court that the portion of special counsel Jack Smith's report on his investigation involving the 2020 election should be released to the public.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department urged a federal appeals court in Atlanta on Wednesday to clear the way for the release of a portion of special counsel Jack Smith's report detailing his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "In court documents filed with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, the government wrote that Attorney General Merrick Garland has determined not to release the volume of Smith's report that deals with the classified documents case, so long as criminal proceedings involving co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira are pending.",
      "Garland does, however, plan to submit to Congress and the public the first volume of Smith's report, which relates to his investigation and prosecution of Trump stemming from the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"Because the Attorney General has determined not to release to the public Volume Two of the Final Report to the public while defendants' case remains pending\u2014the volume that concerns the proceedings against defendants\u2014an injunction is unnecessary,\" prosecutors wrote, urging the 11th Circuit to deny the emergency request for an injunction.",
      "They noted that Smith sent his report to Garland on Tuesday and wrote in a cover letter to the attorney general that the portion involving Nauta and de Oliveira should not be released to the public while their cases are pending.",
      "Garland on Wednesday sent a letter formally informing the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees that Smith was finished with his probe, had completed the report and the report was ready for release. Garland reiterated that he would not do so unless and until the courts clear the way, and that even if they do, he would not release the volume related to the classified documents probe because of pending cases.",
      "Justice Department lawyers said a redacted version of the second volume of the report \u2014 involving the alleged mishandling of classified documents \u2014 would be made available for review only by the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees at their request, and if they agree not to release the information publicly.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The filing responded to an effort by Trump's former co-defendants, aide Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee de Oliveria, to stop the report's release. They argued their cases would be prejudiced by the release of the special counsel's report as the appeals of their cases continue.",
      "In a subsequent filing to the 11th Circuit, lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira asked the appeals court to send the dispute back to District Judge Aileen Cannon's court\u00a0for a hearing and, in the meantime, stop Garland and the Justice Department from issuing Smith's final report.",
      "\"A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual's right to a fair trial,\" lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira wrote.",
      "Allowing leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to see the second volume of the report \"reflects an improper attempt to remove from the district court the responsibility to oversee and control the flow of information related to a criminal trial over which it presides, and to place that role instead in the hands of the prosecuting authority \u2014 who unlike the trial court has a vested interest in furthering its own narrative of culpability,\" they said.",
      "Defense attorneys earlier this week simultaneously asked the appeals court and Cannon, who oversaw and dismissed the Trump classified documents case, to block Smith and Garland from publicly releasing a summary of the special counsel's findings. Cannon issued an order on Tuesday, temporarily enjoining the Justice Department\u00a0from publishing the report until the 11th Circuit decides the matter.",
      "The ongoing litigation is part of a bid by Trump and his allies to prevent federal prosecutors from releasing the contents of Smith's report. Smith revealed he has prepared a two-volume report to present to the attorney general, which prosecutors said was submitted Tuesday evening. Garland has pledged to release to the public all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and has so far stood by that promise, including after an investigation related to President Biden's handling of classified records.",
      "Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect, one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump, which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The special counsel and his office withdrew from the case after the 11th Circuit agreed to dismiss the appeal as it pertains to Trump following his election to a second term in November. It is now being overseen by the U.S. attorney in South Florida and other Justice Department lawyers.",
      "Still, Trump's attorneys urged Garland to remove Smith from his position and put a stop to the report's release, according to a letter included in court documents on Monday.",
      "\"Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action, you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\" Trump's attorneys wrote.",
      "But prosecutors told the 11th Circuit in their filing that the president-elect has not made any requests to the appeals court and \"would have no basis to seek to block the public release of Volume One of the final report,\" which deals with the investigation and prosecution arising from the alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "In the classified documents case, Trump was charged alongside Nauta and de Oliveira in an alleged scheme to obstruct the federal probe. Both men pleaded not guilty.",
      "Smith ultimately dropped his bids to prosecute Trump, citing Justice Department rules that forbid the prosecution of a sitting president. But he opted to continue with an appeal of Cannon's decision to dismiss the case against Nauta and de Oliveira to overturn the finding that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed.",
      "The defendants, as a result, sought to stop the release as the case proceeded.",
      "During a press conference on Tuesday, Trump slammed Smith as a \"bad guy\" and complimented Cannon, whom he appointed to the federal bench during his first term, as a \"brilliant judge.\"",

      "Billy Long, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the IRS, is facing questions about his qualifications to lead the tax agency from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who serves on the Senate's Finance Committee.",
      "While serving as a representative, Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer,\u00a0co-sponsored legislation\u00a0that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code. After leaving office, he served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, the Employee Retention Tax Credit, or ERTC.",
      "In her Jan. 9 letter to Long, Warren raises questions about Long's tax expertise as well as his promotion of the ERTC, which has been\u00a0flagged\u00a0by the IRS for its high rate of fraud. Unlike other recent IRS tax commissioners, Long doesn't have a depth of experience in the tax industry, nor does he have a degree in accounting or tax law.",
      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",
      "The Trump campaign and Long didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a 2023 podcast, Long talked about his work with a firm called Lifetime Advisors, where he helped promote the ERTC to businesses, although Warren's letter notes that the podcast appears to have been \"pulled down from multiple podcast platforms, including the Listen Notes website, Apple, Spotify and YouTube.\"",
      "In the podcast, which CBS MoneyWatch listened to in December before it was taken down, Long said qualifying for credit was difficult during its first iteration, but that he helped make it easier for businesses to be eligible while he was in Congress.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "In the letter, Warren asks Long to provide information about his work with the ERTC, including whether any returns he had worked on claiming the credit have been challenged by the IRS. Among the senator's other queries are whether Long directed anyone to pull down the 2023 podcast, and how he earned the designation of \"certified tax & business adviser,\" a term that he has used to describe himself on his X profile.",
      "\"Although you bill yourself as a 'Certified Business and Tax Adviser,' this certification appears to only require a three-day training,\" Warren noted. \"There is no record of you on the IRS' database of tax return preparers \u2014 a searchable directory that lists individuals who hold credentials recognized by the IRS \u2014 nor do you appear in the Missouri Board of Accountancy database.\"",

      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded sarcastically on Wednesday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "Standing before a 17th-century world map in her daily press briefing, Sheinbaum proposed dryly that North America should be renamed \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" or \"Mexican America,\" because a founding document dating from 1814 that preceded Mexico's constitution referred to it that way.",
      "\"That sounds nice, no?\" she added with a sarcastic tone. She also noted that the Gulf of Mexico had been named that way since 1607.",
      "Trump made the comments during an open-ended Mar-a-Lago press conference during which he also\u00a0didn't rule out\u00a0using military or economic coercion to bring Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control.",
      "\"We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful ring,\" Trump said. \"That covers a lot of territory, the Gulf of America. What a beautiful name. And it's appropriate. It's appropriate. And Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country.\"",
      "Trump ally Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she would introduce\u00a0legislation\u00a0to that effect on Thursday morning.",
      "The exchange has started to answer a larger question lingering over the bilateral relationship between the two regional powers: How would newly elected Sheinbaum handle Trump's strong-handed diplomatic approach, and promises of mass-deportations and crippling taxes on trading partners like Mexico?",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 who hailed from a similar strain of class populism as Trump, even though he leaned left \u2013 was able to build a relationship with Trump as an ally, and his government began to block migrants from going north under U.S. pressure, a boon to Trump.",
      "But it was unclear if Mexico's first woman president, a scientist and leftist lacking the folksy populism that rocketed L\u00f3pez Obrador into power, would be able to build the same relationship.",
      "While Wednesday's joke quickly ricocheted across social media feeds, it also set the tone for what a Sheinbaum-Trump relationship could look like in the coming years.",
      "\"Humor can be a good tactic, it projects strength, which is what Trump responds to. It was probably the right choice on this issue,\" said Brian Winter, vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \"Although President Sheinbaum knows it won't work on everything - Trump and his administration will demand serious engagement from Mexico on the big issues of immigration, drugs and trade.\"",
      "It comes after other stern but collaborative responses by Sheinbaum regarding Trump's proposals.",
      "On Trump's pitch to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, Sheinbaum warned that if the new U.S. administration imposes tariffs on Mexico, her administration would respond with similar measures. She said any sort of tax was \"not acceptable and would cause inflation and job losses for the United States and Mexico.\"",
      "She's taken a more concessionary tone on immigration, falling in line with years of Mexican efforts to block migrants from traveling north amid mounting pressure by the U.S.",
      "After originally saying her government would push the Trump administration to deport migrants directly back to their own countries, in January she said Mexico would be open to accepting deportees from other countries, but Mexico could limit it to certain nationalities or request compensation.",
      "Canada also gave a sarcastic response this week to Trump's recent comments about annexing America's northern neighbor. According to Canada's CTV News, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was questioned by a reporter on Monday about Trump's multi-prong threats to\u00a0impose a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico\u00a0in the first hours of his presidency, as well as making Canada the \"51st state.\"",
      "\"You know something, to the president, I'll make him a counteroffer. How about if we buy Alaska, and we'll throw in Minnesota and Minneapolis at the same time,\" Ford said.",

      "NEW YORK --\u00a0Disgraced former Congressman George Santos had his February sentencing delayed until April 25, a judge ruled Wednesday.",
      "That will give Santos, 36, additional time to keep making new episodes of his podcast, \"Pants on Fire with George Santos,\" presumably so that he can pay the money he owes the government.",
      "Back in August, Santos\u00a0pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He owes $578,752.92 as per his plea deal, including $373,749.97 in restitution and $205,002.97 in forfeiture. He is expected to go to prison for at least two years when he is sentenced, although the judge previously said the estimated sentencing range was between 6-8 years.",
      "In a letter to a judge last Friday, Santos' attorneys said their client is required to pay more than $200,000 in forfeiture money 30 days before he is sentenced. They said that, through his podcast, Santos \"now has a viable path to making meaningful progress in satisfying his obligations, requiring only additional time for the quarterly compensation structure to generate sufficient funds.\"",
      "They asked the judge to delay his sentencing from Feb. 7 until a Friday in August, but the judge only moved it 10 weeks.",

      "\"On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Mares and others with him attended the rally on the National Mall carrying their handguns on their persons but having left their rifles in Mares' truck,\" the release said. \"Afterward, Mares and others walked down toward the U.S. Capitol building between approximately 12:15 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., entered the restricted permitter, and remained on U.S. Capitol grounds until approximately 4:30 p.m., all while carrying their handguns.\"",
      "The Justice Department said \"an individual with Mares posted to social media a photograph of six firearms, magazines, and the hats that appear to have been worn by Mares and others that day on Capitol grounds.\" In the photo, the weapons and hats were shown arrayed across what appears to be a bed at a hotel.",
      "Prosecutors also alleged that Mares had posted on social media that he \"'believe[d] that every #patriot should on January 6 if you can't make it to Washington DC you should go to your state capitol and local mayors offices heavily armed and drag out and either jail or execute all the known CORRUPT #politicans for treason!'\" among other similar sentiments.\"",
      "And in one of the first wave of Jan. 6 criminal cases, Lonnie Coffman was accused by the government of driving from Alabama to Washington, D.C., in a pickup truck that \"contained several loaded firearms within arms-reach of the driver's seat,\" including a 9mm Hi-Point handgun, a Windham Weaponry rifle and a Hatfield Gun Company SAS shotgun, according to the statement of offense.",
      "The pickup also contained \"hundreds of rounds of ammunition, large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun, cloth rags, lighters, a cooler containing eleven mason jars, and other items.\" And the government also said that as Coffman walked through D.C., and \"in the direction\" of the U.S. Capitol and the rally on the national mall on Jan. 6, \"he knowingly carried on his person two additional loaded firearms.\"",
      "Coffman pleaded guilty to a federal charge of possession of an unregistered firearm and agreed to cooperate with the government on other cases.",

    "summary": "The law is intended to prevent the financial maneuvers Steward used to siphon money away from direct patient care.",
    "story": [
      "Private equity firms that invest in hospitals will now face increased oversight in Massachusetts under a new law signed by Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday, after the scandal-plagued ownership of nine hospitals in the state exposed significant risks to patient care.",
      "The new law would increase transparency in the opaque financial dealings between hospitals and investment groups that own them. Healey signed it right before the close of the year's state legislative session.",
      "The law will increase financial penalties for hospitals, private equity investors, real estate investment trusts and other entities for failing to submit required financial reporting to the state on time. Fines for not submitting information on time will soar from $1,000 to $25,000 per week, and the law also removes the annual cap of $50,000.",
      "The attorney general's office and Massachusetts Health Policy Commission will also gain more investigative power over private equity deals and the commission will have the power to demand testimony regarding pricing, financial stability and ownership structure from private equity investors and healthcare real estate trusts.",
      "The law comes as a victory for the state after two hospitals closed last year when their owner, Dallas-based Steward Health Care, declared bankruptcy. Steward, which owned more than 30 hospitals across the country, was one of the state's largest hospital operators.",
      "For two years, CBS News has been investigating the detrimental impact that private equity ownership can have on U.S. hospitals \u2014 especially those serving areas of high need and few resources. While\u00a0Steward's hospitals\u00a0struggled, CBS News found evidence of lavish spending by CEO Ralph de la Torre, including the purchase of a $40 million yacht in 2021, a $7 million Texas horse ranch in 2022, and two corporate jets valued at $95 million.",
      "Healy said at a news conference that the new law will \"close loopholes in our regulatory processes so that for-profit providers like Steward Health Care are subject to the same transparency rules as nonprofit providers.\" She added, \"as attorney general, I spent years in court trying to hold Steward to this standard, and I'm glad that our laws will no longer be exploited in this way.\"",
      "The law will also bar the Department of Public Health from granting a license to establish or maintain an acute care hospital that has leased its main campus from a real estate investment trust \u2014 a strategy favored by the private equity industry that Steward used to siphon money away from direct patient care.",
      "\"Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,\" said state House Speaker Ronald J. Mariano during the news conference. \"That's why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.\"",
      "CBS News reached out Steward Health Care regarding the new legislation, and a representative said the company has no comment.",
      "Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate Budget Committee released a scathing 162-page report on two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of other hospital companies in underserved communities that put patients in danger.",

Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to intervene in his \"hush money\" case in New York ahead of his scheduled sentencing Friday.",
      "In a\u00a0request for emergency relief filed with the Supreme Court, the president-elect asked the justices to temporarily block further criminal proceedings in New York state court, including his upcoming sentencing, before he takes office. Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records last summer and is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday at 9:30 a.m.",
      "Trump's bid comes after a New York appeals court on Tuesday rejected his latest effort to postpone his sentencing. His lawyers have argued that a president's immunity from criminal proceedings extends to the transition period \u2014 the time between the election and inauguration.",
      "In addition to asking the Supreme Court to enter a stay, Trump's lawyers said in the Wednesday morning filing that they had simultaneously asked the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, to block the proceedings. The New York filing was made at about 4 p.m., a court spokesperson said.",
      "In their submission to the Supreme Court, Trump's lawyers argued that the justices should step in and pause his sentencing \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.\" During the transition, they wrote, the president-elect is engaging in the \"extraordinarily demanding task of preparing to assume the executive power of the United States.\"",
      "The president-elect's effort to toss out the jury verdict \"will ultimately result in the dismissal of the District Attorney's politically motivated prosecution that was flawed from the very beginning, centered around the wrongful actions and false claims of a disgraced, disbarred serial-liar former attorney, violated President Trump's due process rights, and had no merit,\" predicted lawyer D. John Sauer, who Trump selected to serve as solicitor general in his next term.",
      "A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said his office \"will respond in court papers.\"",
      "Trump became the first former president to be convicted of crimes when a jury found him guilty of 34 state felony counts in late May and concluded he authorized a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a $130,000 \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star before the 2016 presidential election.",
      "The investigation that led to the New York charges against Trump began in 2018 and has already produced a landmark Supreme Court decision. The court ruled in July 2020 that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records as part of its criminal probe. Trump continued to fight against their release until after his first presidency in 2021, but the Supreme Court rejected his subsequent efforts to shield the financial records from prosecutors.",
      "He was set to be sentenced July 11, but the proceedings were postponed after the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision finding former presidents cannot be federally prosecuted for official actions taken while in office. The ruling stemmed from a different case involving Trump brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which arose out of his alleged efforts to stay in power after the 2020 election. Charges in that case have since been dropped, as Justice Department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump's sentencing was then set for Sept. 18, but was pushed back again to avoid interfering with the presidential campaign. After Trump was elected to a second term in early November, a Nov. 26 hearing was then delayed as the president-elect and Manhattan prosecutors argued over how to proceed with the case.",
      "New York Justice Juan Merchan then issued an order last week setting Trump's sentencing for Jan. 10, just 10 days before his inauguration. The New York judge said he does not intend to sentence the president-elect to incarceration and is allowing him to appear virtually instead of in person.",
      "But Trump's lawyers have said that the sentencing is set to take place as he is preparing to return to the White House and would compromise his ability to conduct an orderly transition. During this time, Sauer wrote, the president-elect is communicating with world leaders, setting his domestic and foreign policy agenda and coordinating with the outgoing Biden administration across federal agencies.",
      "\"Forcing President Trump to prepare for a criminal sentencing in a felony case while he is preparing to lead the free world as president of the United States in less than two weeks imposes an intolerable, unconstitutional burden on him that undermines these vital national interests,\" Trump's legal team wrote.",

      "\"The allegations against the respondents set forth their extensive roles as the counselors, commanders, and conspirators in the murder of 2,976 people, the injury of numerous civilians and military personnel, and the destruction of property worth tens of billions of dollars,\" the filing said, arguing later that \"this Court should issue a writ of mandamus and prohibition to the military commission directing it to recognize that the Secretary validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements with the respondents and prohibiting the military commission from conducting hearings in which the respondents would enter guilty pleas pursuant to the invalid pretrial agreements.\"",

      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's powerful Webb Telescope has spotted more than 40 ancient stars in a distant galaxy, researchers said in a new study.",
      "The study, published Monday in Nature, said the researchers used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify the stars. The phenomenon occurs when light bends around a large celestial body, making objects in space seem closer than they appear.",
      "Because of this, the scientists behind the study were able to get a look at 44 stars in the \"Dragon Arc,\" a part of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The arc is about 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth. Without gravitational lensing, trying to identify individual stars so far away would be like trying to look at dust on the moon, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in a statement.",
      "Even with gravitational lensing acting as a magnifying glass, researchers can usually only spot one or a few stars at a time. Light bent around the galaxy cluster, the Center for Astrophysics said, and turned the Dragon Arc, which is normally spiral-shaped, into a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions.\" That allowed researchers to see dozens of stars at once.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" study co-author Fengwu Sun  said in the statement from the Center for Astrophysics. \"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "The stars themselves are also impressive. Many are red supergiants, like the star Betelgeuse in Earth's galaxy. The galaxy they were found in was formed when the universe was about half its current age, the study said. Further observations of the galaxy might allow for studies of these types of stars, the researchers noted, which would allow scientists to learn more about the stars themselves and the way the universe was formed.",
      "\"Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",

      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 12:13:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg cites \"cultural tipping point\" of election in making major changes to practices.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday said the social media company is ending its fact-checking program and replacing it with a community-driven system similar to that of Elon Musk's X.",
      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",
      "Community trust",
      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

      "A plea hearing to enable alleged 9/11 terror attack mastermind\u00a0Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\u00a0to avoid the death penalty will not go forward Friday, after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday to pause the proceedings to allow the court to receive full briefings and hear arguments in the case on an expedited basis.",
      "The court did not rule on whether Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has the power to reverse the plea agreements with Mohammed and other defendants, but instead said it needs more time to make that decision.",

      "According to the motion, the plea agreements reached over the summer, which are still under seal, would have the three defendants plead guilty to the seven charges against them for their alleged roles in the terrorist attacks, in exchange for allowing them to avoid the death penalty. The charges include murder, conspiracy and terrorism, as well as an eighth charge of intentionally causing serious bodily injury.",
      "Government attorneys also asked the appeals court to stay the proceedings \u2014 including Mohammed's plea hearing Friday \u2014 while the request was being considered.",
      "Family members who travelled to Guantanamo Bay are devastated that the plea proceedings won't go forward Friday.

      "Soon after the plea agreements were reached,\u00a0Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u00a0tried to revoke them, arguing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the decision, he alone should have the power to approve the plea deals, rather than the subordinate authority who accepted the deals.",
      "The judge in the 9/11 case and then a military appeals court ruled against Austin and said he had weighed in too late. Austin has since reiterated that he still feels he should be the person who makes the decision on the 9/11 plea deals. On Thursday, during a trip to Germany, Austin was asked again about his decision to revoke the deals.",

      "They also noted that the judge overseeing Trump's New York case has signaled he will not sentence Trump to serve any time in jail, writing \"the burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court's stated intent to impose a sentence of 'unconditional discharge' after a brief virtual hearing.\"",

      "New York Justice Juan Merchan rejected Trump's latest motions to dismiss the case, and set aside his conviction, which argued a president-elect is entitled to the same protections from criminal proceedings as a president. Trump, who railed against the case for years, also said evidence shown at trial that related to his first presidency violated that same constitutional immunity.",
      "New York prosecutors objected to any further delay of the sentencing hearing, which has now been scheduled four times since Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.",
      "They noted in multiple filings this week that Merchan already telegraphed his sentencing decision on Jan. 3, when he said he was inclined to release Trump without incarceration or any other restriction.",
      "In May, a unanimous jury found Trump guilty for authorizing a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a so-called \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star. The payment was made before Trump's first election in 2016, but Trump signed off on the reimbursements to his former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen \u2014 and an accompanying coverup \u2014 during his time in the Oval Office.",

      "Trump's lawyers urged the Supreme Court to prevent his sentencing, set for just 10 days before his inauguration, \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.\"",
      "The case has wound its way to the Supreme Court repeatedly since Manhattan prosecutors began their investigation in 2018. In a landmark 2020 decision, the court ruled that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records. Trump continued to fight their release even after that decision, until 2021, when the Supreme Court again rejected his efforts to shield the financial records.",

However, the city council in November approved a four-year $203 million contract with the firefighter's union to help boost wages and health benefits for staff, drawing from the budget's general fund.",
      "The budget cuts drew criticism as firefighters scrambled to contain the ongoing fires.",
      "In a Dec. 4 memo, LAFD Fire Chief Kristin Crowley wrote to the Board of Fire Commissioners that the budget cuts \"have adversely affected the Department's ability to maintain core operations.\"",
      "Crowley said that a $7 million reduction in overtime hours \"severely limited the Department's capacity to prepare for, train for, and respond to large-scale emergencies\" and affected their capacity for brush clearance inspections and residential inspections.",
      "The cuts, Crowley wrote in a\u00a0memo\u00a0from July 2024, resulted from eliminating 58 positions, adjusting sworn salary accounts, and removing one-time expenses. Some have pointed to the one-time expenses, such as the purchase of new breathing equipment for firefighters, a one reason why there may have been a reduction in the current fiscal year's budget compared to the year before.",

      "The fire department overspent by an estimated $66.6 million in the 2023-24 fiscal year, this year's budget shows, with unbudgeted contracts, unused sick time and overtime accounting for much of the overspending.",

John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",

      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",

      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

    "summary": "Hundreds of incarcerated firefighters are working to extinguish the massive blaze scorching Los Angeles.",
    "story": [
      "The army of firefighters battling the massive\u00a0Southern California wildfires includes workers who could otherwise remain safely behind bars.",
      "As of Thursday, 783 prison inmates have been deployed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to help contain the blazes, the department confirmed to CBS News. The crews of incarcerated firefighters are embedded with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) to assist its nearly 2,000 firefighters.",
      "The imprisoned firefighters volunteer to participate in CDCR's Conservation (Fire) Camps Program and are paid for their work. Participants supports state, local and federal government agencies when they respond to natural disasters.",
      "CDCR operates 35 so-called fire camps across 25 different California counties. Two of the camps are for incarcerated women. They are minimum-security facilities staffed with correctional personnel who supervise camp participants 24 hours per day.",
      "The department says inmates work cutting fire lines and removing fuel from behind structures to help slow fires' spread. They can also serve in support roles at the camps, including cooking, laundry and water treatment plant operation.",
      "Participation in the camps is voluntary, and those who join in must be deemed physically and mentally fit. Additionally, they must have no more than eight years remaining on their sentences. Convictions for rape and other sex offenses, as well as for murder, arson and some other serious crimes, disqualifies an inmate from participating.",
      "How much do incarcerated firefighters make?",
      "Imprisoned firefighters' pay depends on their skill level. They earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to CDCR, which pays their wages. Wage levels doubled in 2023, up from between $2.90 and $5.12 per day.",
      "Inmates in the program also earn supplemental pay while responding to emergencies. Cal Fire pays an additional $1 an hour, regardless of firefighters' skill level. And when crews work a 24-hour shift, followed by a 24-hour period of rest, the lowest-skilled firefighter would earn $26.90 in a day.",
      "Additionally, camp participants earn time credits toward their sentences. Specifically, most earn two additional days off their sentences for every day served on a fire crew.",
      "Camp participants are eligible for employment with Cal Fire once they have served their sentences, a path many choose to take, according to CDCR. The department says some of these individuals have successfully transitioned to roles with Cal Fire, the U.S. Forest Service, and interagency hotshot crews.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, the\u00a0fires\u00a0had scorched more than 45 square miles across the Los Angeles area. At least five people are dead, and more than 179,000 Los Angelenos were under evacuation orders, according to officials.",

    "summary": "\"Singledom has peaked,\" said Dr. Richard Fry, a labor economist at Pew Research Center who conducted the survey.",
    "story": [
      "American adults are looking for love \u2014   and many are reporting they found someone. For the first time in almost two decades, the share of unpartnered adults \u2014 who are neither married nor living with an unmarried partner \u2014 in the United States has declined, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data released on Wednesday. This decline coincided with a slight rise in couples who reported being married, from 50% to 51%, Pew found, signaling a possible change in America's relationships.",
      "\"Singledom has peaked,\" Dr. Richard Fry, a labor economist who conducted the survey and has worked as a research analyst for Pew for 23 years, told CBS News. Fry couldn't say whether the trend would continue but noted that the changes signified a possible shift in direction for America's relationships. Those surveyed said they are currently not married, living with a partner or in a committed romantic relationship. A small share of single adults report that they are casually dating someone.",
      "In 2000, unpartnered adults accounted for 38% of the population, said Fry, who heads a team of researchers focusing on family and American work life. Those numbers rose quickly, hitting a peak of 44% in 2019. In 2023 the numbers declined to 42%, said Fry.",
      "While certain groups, including young people ages 18-24, older women and those without a high school diploma, reported being unpartnered in higher numbers than the general adult population, across the board, romantic relationships trended upward. Adults reporting to the Census Bureau that they were living with an unmarried partner increased from 6% to 7% in that same time period, and data from the bureau shows the number of people reporting they were married went from 50% to 51%, from 2019 to 2023, Pew found.",
      "There has not been an uptick in new marriages, data from the Census Bureau shows, but there have been fewer divorces. 2012 saw a peak of 2% of married adults reporting they had gotten divorced in the prior year. In 2023, a record-low 1.4% of married adults got divorced, Pew found.",
      "Beyond any sociological value, these numbers also have financial impacts, as partnered adults tend to fare better economically.\u00a0Research from The Ohio State University\u00a0surveying about 9,000 people found that divorce reduces a person's wealth by about three-quarters compared to that of a single person, while being married almost doubles comparative wealth.",
      "These findings dovetail with the Pew survey, which, citing a 2023 Federal Reserve survey, shows that unpartnered adults tend to be financially worse off than partnered adults. Some 64% of single adults said they were doing at least okay financially, compared with 77% of partnered adults, Pew said.",
      "\"From a purely economic point of view, adults who have partners seem to be better off financially,\" said Fry.",
      "Men in particular are in a better position financially if they are married, said Fry. Research shows single men are also much less likely than partnered men to be employed, as women tend to gravitate toward men they view as providers, according to Fry.",
      "\"Economically successful men are more attractive partners, but marriage also makes them more 'successful on the job.' Men are more productive if they get married,\" said Fry.",
      "Zach Thompson hasn't been single for any of his adult life \u2014 and he prefers it that way. He met his wife, Jenna, in middle school. They were friends through high school, got engaged and then the couple married in 2020.",
      "Thompson, a filmmaker from South Carolina, said that growing up, he saw many of his family members in relationships and knew he wanted one too. When he met his wife, it felt like a natural progression. he said. Now, the 26-year-old couple lives together in Charleston. \"If you find someone you can spend the rest of your life with, there is real value and worth in fighting for a relationship and making it work,\" said Thompson.",

She has petitioned Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren, who committed her, for release four times since June 2022. She withdrew her first two petitions and Bohren denied her second request this past April, finding she still presented a threat to the public.",
      "Geyser, now 22 years old, filed her latest petition in October. Bohren decided to grant her release after a day-long hearing Thursday, finding that she had maximized her treatment options at the facility and is no longer a safety risk. He ordered the state Department of Health Services to set up a plan for housing her in a group home and supervising her subject to his approval at a hearing within 60 days.",

      "\"She's done what she's supposed to do,\" Bohren said. \"She appears to have a good attitude.\"",
      "Geyser and Anissa Weier were 12 years old in 2014 when they lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a Waukesha park after a sleepover. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier egged her on. Leutner barely survived.",

Collins added that Geyser told her that she hates what she did to Leutner and can't forgive herself.",

      "Mr. Biden was supposed to speak in Thermal, California, earlier this week, but his remarks were canceled due to excessive high winds. He was briefed on the fires while in California instead. The president canceled a trip to Italy to see Pope Francis and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni this week so he could focus on the federal response to the blazes.",

The Pentagon has also readied firefighting personnel and capabilities. Hurricane-force\u00a0Santa Ana winds, dry conditions and a lack of sufficient water have fueled the fires. High winds are expected into Friday.",

    "summary": "For those who have it, a standard homeowners' insurance policy does cover destruction caused by fire, including wildfires.",
    "story": [
      "As deadly\u00a0wildfires engulf swaths\u00a0of Los Angeles County, forcing nearly 200,000 people from their houses, a still-to-be known number of residents will be contending with insurance claims to recoup losses and rebuild or repair their homes. For those looking to be treated fairly and paid for damage and destruction to their property, speaking up and doing advance research is crucial, experts and consumer advocates say.",
      "The good news? Unlike with\u00a0flooding, a standard homeowners' policy covers destruction and damage caused by fire, including wildfires, and a\u00a0standard renters' insurance policy covers the renter's personal belongings, according to the Insurance Information Institute.",
      "The optional comprehensive part of a standard auto insurance policy covers vehicles against damage caused by fire and falling objects. Approximately 75% of U.S. drivers opt to buy it.",
      "\"California property insurers are acting as financial first responders to help their impacted customers recover from the Los Angeles fires,\" the institute stated on Thursday. \"This includes providing immediate relief through additional living expenses coverage (ALE) for displaced policyholders. Losses to property and vehicles will be covered up to the limits contained with an insurance policy.\"",
      "Property insurers are required to immediately pay policyholders a minimum of one-third of the estimated value of their personal belongings and a minimum of four months' worth of rent for the local area in which they live, it stated, citing state regulations.",
      "When and how to file a claim",
      "Triple-I advises the following\u00a0steps to begin filing a claim:",
      "Contact your insurance carrier or agent as soon as possible to begin the claim-filing process, and make sure to ask about requirements and deadlines. Many insurers have a mobile app where you can file a claim.",
      "Take photos of damaged items (if it is safe to do so) and don't discard damaged items until your assigned insurance adjuster has completed their assessment.",
      "Keep all receipts for out-of-pocket expenses, such as temporary lodging.",
      "Things to know and watch out for",
      "Many property owners hit with large and total losses learn the hard way that they are not fully insured. The issue is so common that United Policyholders has an entire section on its website devoted to underinsurance help. \"Many property owners have succeeded in getting the coverage they thought they had but didn't, but many have given up. Insurers count on you giving up,\" according to the nonprofit organization that advocates for policyholders of all types.",
      "Fires that damage but don't completely destroy one's home create their own insurance claim issues, according to United Policyholders. Things to watch out for include hidden damage from water, smoke, ash and mold. Air quality and ducts should also be considered. \"Repairs should return your property to a 'uniform and consistent appearance' even if that means replacing undamaged items such as roof tiles or carpeting,\" it stated.",
      "People living in seemingly unscathed residences alongside homes that burned down should still have their place inspected for possible structural and other damage from extreme heat, smoke or fire retardant. \"If your insurer refuses to conduct or pay for proper inspections, ask again in writing; politely remind them of their legal duty to thoroughly investigate all damage, including hidden damage. If a dispute arises, it's worth finding and paying for your own inspection by an independent reputable specialist,\" United Policyholders said.",
      "Smoke damage is a covered peril in most policies, with disputes often arising over cleaning or replacing exposed items.",
      "Extreme heat and smoke kills most plants and may contaminate soil. Keep your claim open for at least six months and file supplemental claims if necessary, as damaged plants may not die right away. Coverage for landscaping replacement is typically a set amount or percentage of your dwelling coverage. The losses are frequently only partially covered. \"Mature trees can be valued as high as $5,000 yet many policies contact a $500 per tree limit.\"",
      "Another thing to keep in mind: Unreimbursed losses can offset your tax obligations when you claim as a casualty loss deduction.",
      "If one believes they are being treated poorly by their insurance company, the California Department of Insurance has an online\u00a0form that homeowners can use to file complaints.",
      "Steps in preparing to evacuate",
      "For those told to evacuate due to the wildfires, do so immediately. For those preparing to evacuate, here are some tips from United Policyholders:",
      "1. Document your home and possessions. Take pictures or a video of each room and the outside of your house. Build as much of an inventory as time permits including furnishings, artwork, jewelry and appliances. \"After a traumatic loss, it's impossible to remember everything you had, so most people never collect their full insurance benefits,\" United Policyholders noted.",
      "2. Pack important documents:",

      "3. Start savings receipts. Wildfire evacuees can file for reimbursement for additional living expenses. Check the \"loss of use\" section of your policy. If your home is not damaged and your temporary living expenses are modest, keep in mind that filing a claim goes on your record and can hike your insurance costs.",

      "In a 84 to 9 vote, the Senate voted to advance the legislation, with 31 Democrats joining all voting Republicans to clear a 60-vote threshold to begin debate. The bill marks the first policy legislation of the new Congress, and the House approved it in a bipartisan vote of its own on Tuesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune will now decide which, if any, amendments will be considered on the floor. Some Democrats who voted to proceed said they did so in order to offer changes to the legislation before deciding how they would vote on final passage.",
      "The bill is named after Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. A judge convicted the man, Jose Ibarra, on murder and other charges related to Riley's death in November.",
      "Under current law, the Department of Homeland Security is mandated to detain noncitizens convicted of certain crimes, including \"aggravated felonies,\" or serious offenses like murder and sexual assault. The Laken Riley Act would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes.",
      "Whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding is an open question. The agency is currently using roughly 39,000 of 41,000 detention beds funded by Congress.",
      "The legislation would also empower state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "A growing list of Democrats announced their plans to support the Republican-led measure ahead of Thursday's vote, including Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. Fetterman and Gallego are co-sponsors in the Senate, and Slotkin voted for the legislation as a member of the House last year.",
      "On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer chimed in, saying ahead of the vote that he would support advancing the legislation and that he expected it to have enough votes to move forward. Still, he stressed that Democrats want to have a \"robust debate\" when they can offer amendments on the bill.",
      "\"This is an important issue,\" Schumer said. \"We should have a debate and amendments and that's why I am voting yes on the motion to proceed.\"",
      "The House first approved the legislation last year, but it stalled in the then-Democratic controlled Senate. This week, 48 House Democrats joined all voting Republicans to approve the measure \u2014 up from 37 who did so last year \u2014 despite pushback from some Democrats who have argued that the bill is merely political posturing.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican and the new majority whip, encouraged bipartisan support for the legislation on Thursday, saying it's \"nice to see that the results of the election in November have changed the thinking of some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\"",
      "\"I'm happy to hear that Democrats are now open to debating this important bill,\" Barrasso said, though he argued that debating it isn't enough and \"the Senate must go on to pass it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades Fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an Thursday email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis of insurance data by CBS San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, State Farm said, \"Our No. 1 priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "State Farm's decision reflects a trend of private insurers, including\u00a0Allstate\u00a0and Farmers Insurance, of dropping California policies or halting underwriting, leaving homeowners with the choice of getting coverage through the insurer of last resort, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan, or forgo insurance altogether. The FAIR Plan provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not.",
      "As a result, homeowners in Pacific Palisades had increasingly shifted to the FAIR Plan, with roughly 1,400 of the town's 9,000 homes covered by the plan in 2024, more than quadruple the number in 2020, according to data from the insurer. In other words, prior to the disaster, about 1 in 7 homeowners were reliant on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The Palisades Fire could become the costliest wildfire in history because of the number of buildings that have been destroyed and as the structures rank among the nation's most expensive homes, said Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist, on a Wednesday webcast about the disaster. The neighborhood's 9,000 residential units have a median home value of $3.1 million,\u00a0according to real estate data firm ATTOM Data.",
      "While personally and financially devastating to homeowners, the Los Angeles fires \u2014 which include the Eaton Fire and several other wildfires \u2014 are likely to place added stress on the state's already fragile insurance market, experts and lawmakers say. It's an issue that extends beyond California, with similar issues facing homeowners in Florida, Louisiana and other states.",
      "\"We will be watching to see whether the collapse of a trembling home insurance market accelerates after this added shock,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, wrote on X Thursday. Whitehouse serves on the Senate Budget Committee, which last month issued a report\u00a0about climate change's impact on the insurance market.",
      "In California, State Farm last year said it was discontinuing coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments in the state. Since 2019, more than 100,000 Californians have lost their insurance, according to a San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0analysis of insurance data.",
      "\"A full-scale financial crisis\"",
      "With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the insurance industry is grappling with a new calculus amid rising costs and risks. That's prompting some insurers to decide not to renew insurance policies in counties that are most at risk from climate risks \u2014 and it's not only within California and the other usual suspects, the Senate report found.",
      "\"The data confirm that it is climate change that is driving increasing non-renewal rates,\" it noted. \"Second, the data reveal that Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas are not the only places experiencing spiking non-renewal rates and increasing premiums.\"",
      "Other regions facing rising non-renewal rates are Southern New England, the Carolinas, New Mexico and counties in the Northern Rockies, Oklahoma, and Hawaii, the report found.",
      "The issue isn't just local. \"This is predicted to cascade into plunging property values in communities where insurance becomes impossible to find or prohibitively expensive \u2014 a collapse in property values with the potential to trigger a full-scale financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008,\" the report stressed.",
      "\"Here's how it works: Climate change makes risk unpredictable; risk makes insurance unaffordable or unavailable; no insurance makes mortgages unavailable; without mortgages property values crash; cascading like 2008 into general economy,\" Whitehouse wrote Thursday on X.",
      "FAIR Plan",
      "Still, there's some potential for near-term relief. Homeowners in California could get help from a new state regulation, announced Monday, that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.",
      "The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the FAIR Plan, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said. The average cost of insurance on the FAIR Plan is about $3,200, or more than double the typical homeowner's cost in California, according to Bankrate.",
      "The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, they'd need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said.",
      "In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office.",
      "Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Lara said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok\u200b in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

      "Zelenskyy spoke at a meeting of about 50 allies at the American military's Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the last such gathering before Trump takes office on January 20. His imminent return to the White House has cast doubt on future American support for Ukraine's war effort, given previous favorable remarks about Russia's authoritarian President Vladimir Putin and Trump's vow to quickly end the war nearly three years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "While he's offered no clear indication as to how he intends to achieve that, many in Ukraine and across Europe are concerned Trump could make good on the promise by withholding aid to Ukraine and pushing Zelenskyy to negotiate a truce that lets Russia maintain control over some of the vast territory is has occupied in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.",

    "story": [
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded sarcastically on Wednesday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "Standing before a 17th-century world map in her daily press briefing, Sheinbaum proposed dryly that North America should be renamed \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" or \"Mexican America,\" because a founding document dating from 1814 that preceded Mexico's constitution referred to it that way.",
      "\"That sounds nice, no?\" she added with a sarcastic tone. She also noted that the Gulf of Mexico had been named that way since 1607.",

      "Trump ally Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she would introduce\u00a0legislation\u00a0to that effect on Thursday morning.",
      "The exchange has started to answer a larger question lingering over the bilateral relationship between the two regional powers: How would newly elected Sheinbaum handle Trump's strong-handed diplomatic approach, and promises of mass-deportations and crippling taxes on trading partners like Mexico?",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 who hailed from a similar strain of class populism as Trump, even though he leaned left \u2013 was able to build a relationship with Trump as an ally, and his government began to block migrants from going north under U.S. pressure, a boon to Trump.",
      "But it was unclear if Mexico's first woman president, a scientist and leftist lacking the folksy populism that rocketed L\u00f3pez Obrador into power, would be able to build the same relationship.",
      "While Wednesday's joke quickly ricocheted across social media feeds, it also set the tone for what a Sheinbaum-Trump relationship could look like in the coming years.",
      "\"Humor can be a good tactic, it projects strength, which is what Trump responds to. It was probably the right choice on this issue,\" said Brian Winter, vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \"Although President Sheinbaum knows it won't work on everything - Trump and his administration will demand serious engagement from Mexico on the big issues of immigration, drugs and trade.\"",
      "It comes after other stern but collaborative responses by Sheinbaum regarding Trump's proposals.",
      "On Trump's pitch to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, Sheinbaum warned that if the new U.S. administration imposes tariffs on Mexico, her administration would respond with similar measures. She said any sort of tax was \"not acceptable and would cause inflation and job losses for the United States and Mexico.\"",

According to Canada's CTV News, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was questioned by a reporter on Monday about Trump's multi-prong threats to\u00a0impose a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico\u00a0in the first hours of his presidency, as well as making Canada the \"51st state.\"",

      "The purported leader of a Japan-based crime syndicate pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges alleging that he conspired to traffic uranium and plutonium from Myanmar in the belief that Iran would use it for nuclear weapons.",
      "Takeshi Ebisawa, 60, of Japan, entered the plea in Manhattan federal court to weapons and narcotics trafficking charges that carry a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison and the possibility of life behind bars. Sentencing was set for April 9.",
      "Prosecutors say Ebisawa didn't know he was communicating in 2021 and 2022 with a confidential source for the Drug Enforcement Administration along with the source's associate, who posed as an Iranian general. Ebisawa was arrested in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting.",
      "DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a release that the prosecution demonstrated the DEA's \"unparalleled ability to dismantle the world's most dangerous criminal networks.\"",
      "She said the investigation \"exposed the shocking depths of international organized crime from trafficking nuclear materials to fueling the narcotics trade and arming violent insurgents.\"",

      "\"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma,\" he added.",
      "Court papers said Ebisawa \u2014 who U.S. prosecutors say is a leader of Japan's notorious Yakuza mafia \u2014 told the DEA's confidential source in 2020 that he had access to a large quantity of nuclear materials that he wanted to sell. To support his claim, he sent the source photographs depicting rocky substances with Geiger counters measuring radiation, claiming they contained thorium and uranium, the papers said.",
      "The nuclear material came from an unidentified leader of an \"ethnic insurgent group\" in Myanmar who had been mining uranium in the country, prosecutors said. Ebisawa had proposed that the leader sell uranium through him in order to fund a weapons purchase from the general, court documents allege.",
      "Prosecutors said samples of the alleged nuclear materials were obtained and a U.S. federal lab found they contained uranium, thorium and plutonium, and that the \"the isotope composition of the plutonium\" was weapons-grade, meaning enough of it would be suitable for use in a nuclear weapon.",
      "Last year, prosecutors posted photos of the purported nuclear materials allegedly sent by Ebisawa.",
      "Prosecutors also allege Ebisawa conspired to sell 500 kilograms of methamphetamine and 500 kilograms of heroin to an undercover agent to be distributed in New York. He also allegedly worked to launder $100,000 in purported narcotics proceeds from the U.S. to Japan.",
      "\"As he admitted in federal court today, Takeshi Ebisawa brazenly trafficked nuclear material, including weapons-grade plutonium, out of Burma,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim for the Southern District of New York. \"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma and laundered what he believed to be drug money from New York to Tokyo.\"",

      "The Yakuza membership\u00a0shrunk to 20,400 in 2023, one-third what it was two decades ago, according to the National Police Agency. It attributed the decline largely to legislation passed to combat organized crime that includes measures like barring members of designated groups from opening bank accounts, renting apartments, buying cell phones or insurance.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's military forces were four days into extensive drills on Wednesday that many believe are essentially preparations for how the country could react to a U.S., Israeli or combined attack on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Brigadier Gen. Mohammad-Nazar Azimi, commander of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Najaf Ashraf West Headquarters, has touted the nationwide drills as including \"new weapons and equipment.\"",
      "Azimi also said the exercises would test the capabilities of Iran's Basij paramilitary forces, who are tasked with maintaining domestic security.",
      "The war games are likely aimed not only at demonstrating Iran's ability to respond to and defend against an attack from outside the country, but also to ensure the Basij are ready to quash any domestic uprising against the country's Islamic cleric rulers that could be precipitated by such an attack.",
      "Some Iranian analysts who are critical of the government and spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity said the drills may be a demonstration of power by Iran prompted by the dramatic changes in the balance of power in the Middle East \u2014 with Israel severely disabling Iranian-backed groups in Gaza and Lebanon, and long-time Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad being toppled by rebel forces.",
      "Dr. Yasser Ershadmanesh, a conservative analyst who lectures at the University of Law and International Relations in Tehran, told CBS News on Wednesday that the \"IRGC needed to have this military drill to show them that Iran is ready in all aspects.\"",
      "Ershadmanesh said Israel and its Western allies were exerting pressure on Tehran and presented an \"imminent threat \u2026 so this drill will show Israel and the U.S. that Iran is completely ready, and will send a message to the world and region about Iran's power and readiness.\"",
      "Iran's leaders are likely concerned that President-elect Donald Trump, once he comes back into office on Jan. 20, will increase that pressure significantly by applying further economic sanctions and possibly by supporting an Israeli military attack on Iran's nuclear and or missile facilities.",

So, their hatred for the revolution is a camel grudge (long-term grudge) \u2014 very different from European countries.\"",
      "Trump and his close advisers have been considering options to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon \u2014 something the president-elect has said he will not allow.",
      "Iranian officials have long said they do not intend to pursue nuclear weapons, but since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international nuclear deal with Tehran during his first term in office, Iran has steadily ramped up its nuclear enrichment programs, moving the country closer to the ability to make an atomic bomb.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported recently that Trump and his team have discussed the possibility of preemptive airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities as part of that planning.",
      "One of key features of the ongoing \"Great Prophet 19\" military exercise has been a simulated aerial assault on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, with fictional strikes seeing an enemy hit the plant with a bunker-buster bomb \u2013 the type of weapon Israel or the U.S. could use if they did target Iran's underground nuclear work.",
      "Iran's semi-official SNN news agency said the ongoing exercise began on Jan. 4 and includes air, ground and sea forces and weapons systems, and that it is meant to test Iran's domestically made air defense systems, including a number of different short and mid-range missiles.",
      "Among the weapons being tested in the drills is the Dezful surface-to-air missile system, which is an upgraded version of the Russian-made Tor M1 system.

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, during a long news conference on Tuesday, spoke about his interest in securing U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal, and said he would not rule out the use of military force.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and why Trump might want the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why would Trump want to control it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada and is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. The largest island in the world, but home to only around 60,000 people, it is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic.",
      "It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security purposes,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world. You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Those deposits are likely to draw the interest of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who's become a close adviser to Trump after providing more than $270 million last year to back his and other Republicans' candidacies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why would Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Trump said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" Trump said.",
      "Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed Trump's claims.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "Panama's Foreign Minister Javier Mart\u00ednez-Acha said Tuesday that his government hadn't spoken formally with Trump or his team about the canal recently, but he reiterated previous comments from the country's president that the canal would remain under Panamanian control.",
      "\"The sovereignty of our canal is not negotiable and is part of our history of struggle and an irreversible conquest,\" said Mart\u00ednez-Acha.",
      "China has also denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",

    "story": [
      "Genetically engineered mosquitoes with toxic semen could be a new weapon against tropical disease, Australian scientists said after trialing the novel pest control method.",
      "The \"toxic male technique\" aims to breed mosquitoes that express venomous proteins in their semen, killing off females after mating.",
      "Female mosquitoes are targeted because only they bite and drink blood, thereby spreading diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.",
      "Scientist Sam Beach from Australia's Macquarie University said the method \"could work as quickly as pesticides without also harming beneficial species.\"",
      "\"This innovative solution could transform how we manage pests, offering hope for healthier communities and a more sustainable future,\" Beach said.",
      "The first proof-of-concept trials used fruit flies, a common laboratory species favored for its short two-week life cycle.",

      "Researcher Maciej Maselko said the team would now trial the method in mosquitoes.",
      "\"We still need to implement it in mosquitoes and conduct rigorous safety testing to ensure there are no risks to humans or other non-target species,\" he said.",
      "The mosquitoes would need to be genetically modified so they only expressed the toxic semen once they were released into the wild, the researchers said.",
      "This could be done through so-called \"conditional expression\" techniques, which use chemicals or other biological triggers to turn specific genes on or off at will.",
      "This would allow venomous males to successfully mate with females in lab conditions, producing enough viable offspring for the technique to be scaled up.",
      "Genetic engineering has been used for years to control populations of disease-spreading mosquitoes.",

      "\"I can't assure you, you're talking about Panama and Greenland,\" Trump told reporters during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. \"No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this \u2014 we need them for economic security.\"",

Therefore, there will also not be reactions to the visit,\" Mininnguaq Kleist, Greenland's permanent secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CBS News ahead of his arrival on Tuesday. \"Our country is open for visits, and visitors are welcome in our beautiful country.\"",
      "Reuters, citing a source familiar with the trip, said Trump Jr. was planning to shoot content for a podcast, and that he would only be visiting for one day.",
      "On Monday, President-elect Trump said in a social media post that he was, \"hearing that the people of Greenland are 'MAGA.' My son, Don Jr, and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights. Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "Trump had expressed interest in buying Greenland during his first term in office, though the idea was quickly rebuffed by Danish authorities.",
      "Two weeks ago, Trump said on social media that, \"for purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"",

      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",

      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",

      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",

      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",

      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",

      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",

      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",

      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",

      "\"ADHD is often misunderstood as just being overly distracted or hyperactive \u2014 in reality, it\u2019s a neurodevelopmental condition that affects focus, emotional regulation, time management and impulse control,\" Lisa Anderson, a licensed clinical social worker and clinical director at Brooks Healing Center in Tennessee, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Fox News Digital spoke with multiple mental health experts, who identified the most common signs and symptoms of ADHD in adults.",
      "1. Impulsive behaviors",
      "Adults with ADHD have difficulty managing impulsivity, according to Zo\u00eb Kahn, a licensed psychotherapist and ADHD therapist in Pasadena, California.",
      "\"This can look like blurting out answers in a classroom setting, interrupting in conversation and difficulty thinking through the long-term consequences of choices,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD AFFECTS 1 IN 9 KIDS IN US, NEW REPORT REVEALS: \u2018SHAME AND STIGMA\u2019",
      "Impulsivity can also lead to making snap decisions without considering long-term consequences, Anderson added.",
      "\"It might also manifest subtly, like overspending on impulse purchases or having trouble waiting your turn in group discussions,\" she said.",
      "2. Difficulty focusing or staying on task",
      "Procrastination and difficulty following through on tasks are common signs of ADHD, Anderson noted.",
      "\"You might struggle to start tasks, even when vital, or abandon them halfway through,\" she said. \"You might jump between tasks without finishing anything or focus on smaller, less urgent tasks while the bigger, more critical ones remain untouched.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s a persistent challenge that affects work, relationships and daily responsibilities.\"",
      "It's not about laziness, Anderson noted, but about feeling overwhelmed by what needs to be done.",
      "\"ADHD-related daydreaming is persistent and often disruptive, especially when it happens during crucial tasks or conversations,\" she said.",
      "Procrastination and difficulty following through on tasks are common signs of ADHD, experts said. (iStock)",
      "\"This isn\u2019t just about occasionally zoning out during a long meeting \u2014 it\u2019s a persistent challenge that affects work, relationships and daily responsibilities.\"",

      "People with ADHD may struggle to manage their schedules, often underestimating how long it will take to complete a project or reach a destination.",
      "\"Deadlines might sneak up on you, or you might feel perpetually behind on tasks, no matter how early you started,\" Anderson told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD IN MALES VERSUS FEMALES: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTS",
      "\"This can create a constant cycle of stress and underachievement, leaving you feeling frustrated with yourself.\"",

      "Mental fatigue and burnout are widespread in individuals with ADHD, according to Anderson.",
      "\"The ADHD brain often works in overdrive, juggling competing thoughts and struggling to stay on track,\" she said.",
      "\"ADHD-related daydreaming is persistent and often disruptive, especially when it happens during crucial tasks or conversations.\" (iStock)",
      "\"This constant effort to stay focused and organized can leave you feeling drained, even after relatively short periods of productivity.\"",
      "5. Forgetfulness",
      "Another sign of ADHD in adults is general disorganization, Kahn said, which can lead to an inability to follow through on tasks, meet important deadlines, pay bills on time or keep appointments.",
      "\"The ADHD brain often works in overdrive, juggling competing thoughts and struggling to stay on track.\"",
      "They may also find themselves misplacing important items, like car keys.",
      "\"Adults with ADHD have a hard time finding and keeping focus, which could look like not paying attention in conversation, missing key details, being easily distracted in certain settings, or even focusing on the wrong details,\" Kahn added.",
      "6. Inability to sit still",
      "People with ADHD often find themselves fidgeting and feeling generally restless, according to Dr. Michelle Dees, a board-certified psychiatrist at Luxury Psychiatry Clinic in Chicago.",
      "People with ADHD may find themselves misplacing important items, like car keys. (iStock)",
      "\"In adults, this may present as inner disquietude or incomplete calmness,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "Anderson reiterated this common symptom, noting that in children, it often takes the form of physical hyperactivity.",
      "DEPRESSION COULD BE PREVENTED WITH SPECIFIC DAILY STEP COUNT, STUDY FINDS",
      "\"It often transforms into internal restlessness in adults, where you feel like you can\u2019t fully relax or sit still without feeling jittery,\" she said. \"This constant sense of being \u2018on edge\u2019 can become exhausting over time.\"",
      "7. Relationship challenges",
      "\"Many adults with ADHD have difficulty maintaining relationships with others due to inappropriate social behaviors, such as frequently interrupting, losing interest in conversations, difficulty paying attention and forgetfulness,\" Kahn noted.",
      "\"You might forget to call friends back or forget about commitments to others, which can cause issues in your relationships.\"",
      "Emotional sensitivity often accompanies ADHD, which can manifest as mood swings, irritability or heightened responses to minor frustrations.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Emotional sensitivity often accompanies ADHD, according to Anderson. This can manifest as mood swings, irritability or heightened responses to minor frustrations.",
      "\"Many people with ADHD describe feeling like their emotions are more intense and more challenging to control than those of others around them,\" she added.",
      "When to seek help",
      "If you\u2019ve experienced several of the above signs and they interfere with your daily life, experts recommend seeking help.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"ADHD is not a flaw nor something to be ashamed of \u2014 it\u2019s simply a different way of processing information and interacting with the world,\" said Anderson.",
      "The first step is to speak with a health care professional specializing in ADHD, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist or even your primary care physician, she suggested.",
      "\"They can provide a proper evaluation and help you explore treatment options, including therapy, medication or lifestyle adjustments,\" Anderson noted.",
      "Potential solutions include mindfulness exercises and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help people with ADHD to improve their organization, time management and emotion regulation, the same source stated.",

      "It is important to be assessed by a psychiatrist or mental health clinician if you experience multiple ADHD symptoms, experts advise. (iStock)",
      "\"ADHD has overlapping symptoms with other disorders and is often comorbid with other diagnoses,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "Microdosing Ozempic refers to using smaller amounts compared to the\u00a0standard therapeutic doses that are traditionally prescribed for managing type 2 diabetes and aiding weight loss, experts say.",
      "This practice is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "IS EATING ONCE A DAY A GOOD IDEA? EXPERTS SHARE VARYING OPINIONS ON THE \u2018OMAD DIET\u2019",

      "\"Health care clinicians do not typically recommend this approach.\"",

      "Benefits of microdosing",
      "The primary reason for microdosing is to reduce costs, according to McGowan.",
      "For example, he said, a patient might think that if a full prescription costs over $250 per week, they may be able to achieve some benefit with just $25 worth of the medication.",
      "With approximately 70% of American adults meeting the criteria for being obese or overweight, more people are turning to weight loss medications to help them shed pounds. (iStock)",
      "The average monthly retail price of Ozempic ranges from $1,000 or more without insurance, per GoodRx.",
      "People may also pursue microdosing to reduce the incidence or severity of side effects such as nausea, vomiting or stomach discomfort, according to Stanford.",

      "CHEAP OZEMPIC KNOCK-OFFS HAVE RISEN IN POPULARITY",
      "Any potential benefit of the medication, however, will likely wane proportionally with lower doses, experts noted.",
      "Individuals may also microdose due to supply challenges, according to Dr. Amy Rothberg,\u00a0clinical professor of medicine in the Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes at the University of Michigan.",

      "Potential risks of the practice",
      "The most likely risk of microdosing is a lack of effectiveness, McGowan noted.",
      "\"Microdosing Ozempic or other [weight-loss] medications is entirely off-label and unproven, with no supporting clinical studies,\" he cautioned.",
      "OZEMPIC COULD HELP REDUCE ALZHEIMER\u2019S RISK FOR SOME, STUDY SUGGESTS: \u2018SHIFTING THE PARADIGM\u2019",

      "OZEMPIC PUSH FOR SENIORS? SOME DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER SHOULD BE ON IT",
      "People who microdose often use a \"compounded\" version of the medication,\u00a0which the FDA does not regulate.",

      "Without changes to diet and physical activity patterns, the long-term benefits will disappear once the drug is stopped, one doctor noted. (iStock)",
      "Additionally, these compounded versions are usually dispensed in vials, which requires a syringe to draw it up, in contrast to the FDA-approved versions that are simpler to use.",
      "Using the compounded versions through vials runs the risk of drawing up too much medication \u2014 so instead of\u00a0microdosing, it's possible to macrodose, Sowa warned.",
      "Medical supervision is key",

      "Ayotte argued that \"COGE will make us smarter than ever before when it comes to saving taxpayer dollars and finding better ways to serve the people of our state.\"",
      "A couple of hours later, Ayotte signed her first executive order, which created the 15-member commission.",
      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital ahead of her inauguration, Ayotte appeared to tease her proposal by emphasizing that \"we look for new, efficient ways to do things better and serve taxpayers.\"",
      "The move by New Hampshire's governor comes nearly two months after Trump, days after his presidential election victory, tapped Elon Musk, the world's richest person, and former Republican presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to steer what he called the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" better known by its acronym DOGE.",
      "THE COMEBACK KID: ONE-TIME GOP RISING STAR RISES ONCE AGAIN WITH MAJOR GUBERNATORIAL VICTORY",
      "Ayotte's proposal received plenty of applause from state lawmakers gathered at New Hampshire's Statehouse for the governor's inauguration. Republicans in November's elections made major gains as they strengthened their state House and state Senate majorities.",
      "\"I think it's a brilliant approach,\" Republican Mayor Jay Ruais of Manchester, New Hampshire's largest city, told Fox News.",
      "Ruais, considered a rising star in his party, emphasized \"appointing a commission like this to go after any kind of bloat, I think, is a perfect approach and certainly going to be really beneficial for state government and also certainly helps us downstream at the local level as well.\"",

      "\"Governor Ayotte hasn\u2019t been in office for a full twenty-four hours yet, and she is already laying the groundwork for massive budget cuts to services that people rely on. This is all thanks to years of failed Republican policies she championed,\" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley argued.",
      "\"Throughout her speech, one thing became clear \u2013 Kelly Ayotte is taking a page out of the Donald Trump playbook,\" Buckley claimed. \"Governor Ayotte is following in Trump\u2019s footsteps and setting on a dangerous and costly path for New Hampshire.\"",

      "Ayotte, a former U.S. senator, who previously served as a state attorney general, defeated Democratic gubernatorial nominee and former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig by nearly 10 points in November's election. Her victory kept the governor's office in GOP hands.",
      "In her address, Ayotte praised her predecessor, whose policies she campaigned on continuing.",
      "\"New Hampshire is moving in the right direction, and no one deserves more credit for that after four terms at the helm than Governor Chris Sununu. Thank you, Governor,\" Ayotte said.",

      "Looking ahead, Ayotte told GOP state legislative leaders, \"I look forward to working with you \u2026 to marshal our Republican majorities over the next two years to deliver on the promises we made to keep our state moving in the right direction.\"",
      "And Ayotte reiterated a longstanding pledge by New Hampshire Republicans that she is \"not going to surprise anyone when I say this: no income tax, no sales tax, not now, not ever.\"",
      "But Ayotte also extended an olive branch to Democrats and said, \"My door is always open. Good government knows no party.\"",
      "\"I am going to be a governor for you, whether you\u2019re a Republican, Democrat, Independent, you name it. Because our state is so much bigger than a party or an ideology,\" she added.",
      "And Ayotte, who faced a barrage of attacks by Democrats over the issue of abortion during last year's gubernatorial campaign, repeated her vow to state lawmakers that \"if you send me legislation that further restricts access to abortion beyond our current law: I will veto it.\"",
      "Abortions are legal in New Hampshire through 24 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "Ayotte also made headlines by announcing she'll move to ban cell phones in the state's public schools.",
      "Pointing to her husband, Joe, a retired Air Force pilot who flew combat missions over Iraq and nowadays teaches middle school math, the governor said, \"Joe and I talk about what he is seeing in the classroom and what his students need all the time. He and the thousands of teachers across our state are on the front lines of our education system. Teachers know uniquely what is working for our students and what isn\u2019t. We need to listen to them.",
      "\"That\u2019s why today I am announcing that we will be taking action to ban cell phones in our schools. Screens are negatively impacting our learning environments, drawing students' attention,\" Ayotte highlighted.",
      "Sununu, in a Fox News Digital interview on the eve of Ayotte's inauguration, which was his last full day in office after eight years and four election victories (New Hampshire and neighboring Vermont are the only states in the nation to have two-year terms for governors), praised his successor.",

      "\"Kelly's been a great friend for decades. She's going to be a fantastic governor for New Hampshire. She's New Hampshire, born, bred, ready to go, hit the ground running with a great team here in the state,\" Sununu emphasized.",
      "The outgoing governor added that while he's leaving office, he's always available for advice. \"Anything I could possibly add, she knows she can call and text anytime,\" he said.",

      "As reported by\u00a0threat management company Cyfirma, FireScam is a type of malware that targets Android devices to steal personal information. It works like spyware, keeping an eye on what you do on your Android phone, such as reading your notifications, messages, clipboard content and more.",
      "Hackers are spreading FireScam by pretending it\u2019s a premium version of Telegram. They\u2019ve created a fake website on GitHub that looks like RuStore (a real app store in Russia). When people visit this fake site, they\u2019re tricked into downloading an app that looks like \"Telegram Premium.\" However, this app is actually a trap. Once installed, it downloads the FireScam malware onto your device and starts stealing your personal data.",
      "To avoid detection, the app is heavily disguised using a tool called DexGuard. It asks for permissions to access your storage, check installed apps and install more software. When you open the app, it shows a fake login page that looks like Telegram\u2019s. If you enter your details, it steals your credentials.",
      "The stolen data is first stored in a Firebase Realtime Database, but hackers later move it to private servers. The malware also registers each compromised device with a unique ID so hackers can keep track of their victims.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from fake apps",
      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat.",
      "With our lives so intertwined with digital communication these days, the threat of email fraud is something we all need to take seriously. Recently, Teresa W. shared a scary experience that underscores the dangers of business email compromise (BEC).",
      "\"I almost lost many thousands of dollars through an internet fraud scam. I got a call from our personal banker who said she saw nearly all the money in our business account being withdrawn. She said she got an email from me along with the money wiring directions. I told her I didn't send that and she said my email came from me directly to her. I said to stop everything and I will get to the bottom of it.",
      "\"Apparently the thieves got hold of a wiring instruction paper from my email, which they hacked into. They created a rule in Outlook to bypass me if anything came from them and go straight to the banker. They changed the wiring instructions to go into their account but thank goodness our banker alerted me so I could get to the bottom of it. Too close for comfort!\"",
      "This incident highlights a sophisticated scam where cybercriminals gain access to legitimate email accounts and use them to deceive others into transferring funds. Teresa\u2019s quick action, combined with her banker's vigilance, prevented a significant financial loss, but it serves as a wake-up call for many businesses.",

      "\"You\u2019ve been hacked!\" written on laptop home screen (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is business email compromise (BEC)?",
      "Business email compromise (BEC) is a form of cybercrime that targets companies engaged in wire transfer payments and other financial transactions. The FBI reports that BEC scams have caused billions in losses globally. These scams exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, making them particularly insidious.",
      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How the scam works",
      "Email hacking: Scammers often gain access to email accounts through\u00a0phishing attacks, where they trick users into revealing their login credentials or by deploying malware that captures sensitive information.",
      "Email rule creation: Once inside the account, scammers can create rules in email clients like Outlook that redirect or hide specific emails. This means that any communication related to fraudulent activities may go unnoticed by the victim.",
      "Impersonation: The scammer impersonates the victim and sends emails to contacts, such as banks or vendors, requesting urgent wire transfers or sensitive information.",
      "Execution: The scammer provides convincing details and urgency in their requests, making it appear as though the email is genuinely from the victim. They may use specific language or references only known to the victim and their contacts.",
      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Real-life implications",
      "The consequences of BEC scams can be devastating for businesses. In addition to direct financial losses, companies may face reputational damage, loss of customer trust and potential legal ramifications. For small businesses like Teresa's, which may not have extensive cybersecurity measures in place, the impact can be particularly severe.",
      "Illustration of security on a computer (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Proactive steps to avoid being a victim of BEC scams",
      "To combat BEC and similar scams, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Use strong passwords:\u00a0Ensure passwords are complex (a mix of letters, numbers and symbols) and unique for each account.\u00a0Make sure to create strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication: Where possible, enable multifactor authentication.\u00a0This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

It charges your devices while you're chilling outdoors. What makes it special? Perovskite solar cells that are seriously impressive. These cells are about 30% more powerful than traditional solar cells in bright sunlight and perform twice as well in low light. The umbrella can pump out 80 watts of power through USB-C and even has an XT-60 connection to power things like Anker's new EverFrost electric cooler. So you could literally keep your drinks cold and your phone charged at the same time. While they haven't announced the price yet, you can expect to see this tech to hit stores sometime in spring or summer.",

Samsung Food can track your grocery deliveries, build shopping lists from your fridge contents and even suggest meal plans. Samsung's calling it the \"ultimate AI sous chef,\" and honestly, they might be onto something. Sure, the AI won't actually cook for you (bummer, right?). But for wannabe home chefs who get inspired by every cooking show and movie, this could be a total game-changer. Just don't blame Samsung if you end up spending more time watching cooking shows than actually cooking. Of course, you'll need a 2025 Samsung TV to access this culinary magic. Samsung Food will be available on the QN90F, QN80F and QN70F model TVs.",

That\u2019s why the makers of iPhones and Android devices have multiple ways you can restore contacts on your phone. Following these easy steps outlined above gives you the ability to rectify that situation quickly. It is best to make sure that your mobile devices are being backed up either to the cloud or physically to a computer or hard drive backup so that there is a source from which to restore your contacts. Additionally, should anything go awry when you're doing the restoration process, you have the ability to recover lost data. Accidents happen, but practicing safe data hygiene prevents them from becoming a lost cause or needing a miracle.",

      "One common attack involves phishing campaigns targeting the publishers of legitimate extensions on platforms like the Chrome Web Store. In these campaigns, attackers trick developers into granting permissions to malicious applications, which then insert harmful code into popular extensions. This code can steal cookies, access tokens and other user data.",

      "Once these malicious extensions are published and pass the Chrome Web Store's security review, they are made available to millions of users, putting them at risk of data theft. Attackers can use these extensions to exfiltrate browsing data, monitor user activity and even bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication.",

These emails often create a false sense of urgency, urging you to click on malicious links. Always verify the sender\u2019s email address and avoid clicking on links without double-checking their authenticity. When in doubt, go directly to the official website rather than using a provided link.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Having strong antivirus software is an essential line of defense against malicious software. These tools can detect and block malicious code, even if it has been embedded in browser extensions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install strong malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Limit extension permissions:\u00a0Be cautious about the permissions you grant to browser extensions. Many require access to sensitive data like browsing history, cookies or account information, but not all requests are necessary. Review what each extension asks for and deny permissions that seem excessive. If possible, opt for extensions with limited access to ensure your data remains protected.",
      "4) Limit the number of extensions: Only install extensions that are genuinely needed and regularly review and uninstall those no longer in use.",
      "5) Keep your browser updated: Always update your browser to the latest version. Updates often include critical security patches that protect against vulnerabilities exploited by malicious software. Using an outdated browser increases the risk of being targeted by attacks that could have been prevented with a simple update. Enable automatic updates to ensure you\u2019re always protected. If you are unsure how to update your browser, check out my\u00a0detailed guide for Google Chrome.",
      "6) Regularly audit your extensions: Conduct periodic reviews of installed extensions and remove any that are unnecessary or pose potential security risks.",
      "7) Report suspicious extensions: If you encounter a suspicious extension, report it to the official browser extension marketplace.",

      "The new Location Sharing toggle",
      "Google has introduced a new \"Google Location Sharing\" toggle that is now integrated directly into the Android settings. This update eliminates the need to navigate through Google Maps to manage your Location Sharing preferences. The new feature is part of the latest updates to Google Play Services and is designed to simplify and enhance your control over location sharing.",
      "What Location Sharing means",
      "Before you toggle this off, let\u2019s take a moment to understand why you might want it on and what happens when you turn it off.",
      "Imagine this: You\u2019re meeting a friend in a busy city, and instead of sending a dozen texts back and forth, they can simply see your real-time location on Google Maps. That\u2019s the power of location sharing. It allows you to share your exact position with specific contacts, along with useful details like your device\u2019s battery level or your estimated arrival time if you\u2019re navigating.",
      "But when location sharing is off, your movements stay private. No one can track where you are, and your personal information is better protected from potential misuse. Apps and services lose access to your location data, which not only boosts your privacy but can also save battery life by cutting down on background tracking.",
      "So, before deciding, think about what fits your needs best: staying connected or staying private.",

Certain Android tablets that support the latest versions of the operating system may also have access to this feature. The Location Sharing toggle is part of recent updates to the Android OS, specifically through Google Play Services. You should ensure your devices are running at least Android 12 or later to access this functionality effectively.",

In May 2024, law enforcement shut down a botnet, a network of hijacked devices, called 911 S5.

      "Here are seven essential steps to help you choose a reliable VPN and safeguard your online privacy.",
      "1. Stick to official app stores:\u00a0Always download apps from trusted platforms like the App Store for iOS or the Google Play Store for Android. These stores have built-in security measures that help detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites or third-party stores, as they are more likely to host malicious software. Even on official stores, check the app\u2019s reviews, ratings and download count to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy.",
      "2. Pay attention to app permissions:\u00a0Be careful about the permissions you grant to apps during installation. A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality. Both iOS and Android allow you to review and manage app permissions in your settings, so take the time to double-check what you\u2019ve already allowed.",

      "3. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement\u00a02FA for your VPN accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.",
      "4. Keep software updated: Regularly update all VPN-related software, including clients, servers and associated networking hardware, to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.",
      "5. Use strong encryption: Look for VPN services that use robust encryption protocols like AES-256 to protect your data.",
      "6. Monitor VPN traffic: Continuously monitor VPN traffic and logs for unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.",
      "7. Invest in strong antivirus software: A strong antivirus program can help detect and remove malware before it compromises your device. Many antivirus apps also come with features like web protection, anti-phishing tools and the ability to scan new apps for threats. While there are free options, premium versions often provide more comprehensive protection. Look for a trusted name in cybersecurity when choosing an antivirus solution.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Fake VPN apps are everywhere, and they\u2019re bad news. They\u2019re not just useless. They can turn your device into a tool for cybercriminals. The 911 S5 botnet showed us just how dangerous free VPNs can be, turning millions of devices into a giant network for fraud and attacks. The truth is free VPNs aren\u2019t really free. They often come with weak security, leak your data or demand permissions that put your privacy at risk. If you\u2019re serious about protecting your online activity, invest in a trusted, paid VPN service.",

      "Ingenuity's legacy",
      "Ingenuity's journey on Mars far exceeded expectations. Originally designed for just five test flights over 30 days, it ultimately completed an astounding 72 flights in nearly three years. The helicopter served as an aerial scout for the Perseverance rover, helping scientists and engineers gather valuable data about Mars' terrain and atmosphere.",
      "Throughout its mission, Ingenuity pushed the boundaries of extraterrestrial flight, reaching a maximum altitude of\u00a078.7 feet, achieving a top speed of 22.4 mph and completing a single longest flight that covered 2,310 feet.",

    "story": [
      "You'll wonder how you functioned without an AirTag.",
      "Apple AirTags can be a great way to outsmart car thieves, but there are some drawbacks to consider. A key limitation is that thieves who also have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are trying to steal. This makes hiding an AirTag tricky.",
      "That\u2019s why we were intrigued by Brian\u2019s inquiry about using other ways to make Apple AirTags undetectable to car thieves or outsmarting them twice.",
      "\"If an AirTag is put in an RFID wallet and hidden in a car, can the AirTag be located by a thief using a locator? I know the AirTag will function in the wallet, but will it be undetectable by the thief?\" \u2014 Brian, LaSalle, Illinois",

      "Why RFID wallets might not outsmart car thieves?",
      "Some thieves use RFID readers, which use radio waves, to scan and read data such as credit cards in wallets. The function of RFID wallets and bags is to protect items or devices from these radio waves by blocking them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Apple AirTags use different technology, so even if it was placed in an RFID-blocking wallet or bag, it could still be detected by a thief with an iPhone or locator. Unlike the radio waves used to scan for credit cards and other data, Apple AirTags use Bluetooth and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology. Neither technology can be shielded by RFID-blocking material because those materials cannot block Bluetooth and UWB signals.",
      "A person holding an RFID wallet. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DO EMF BLOCKERS REALLY PROTECT US?",
      "What can block AirTag technology?",
      "Faraday bags, on the other hand, use electromagnetic shielding and can successfully block Apple AirTag signals, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, from being detected by thieves. The only issue with putting an Apple AirTag in a Faraday bag to hide in your car is that if the car thief cannot read or locate the signal it emits, you cannot either.",
      "While the\u00a0Apple AirTag may go undetected when in a Faraday bag, you will likely not be able to use FindMy or any other tracking methods to locate it either, because those methods require signals pinged from the AirTag to other iPhones and Apple Devices to track location.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Alternatives to AirTags for car security",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags offer some benefits, there are other technologies and methods to consider for enhancing car security. For example, GPS trackers provide real-time location data without the risk of being detected by a nearby iPhone. Additionally, physical deterrents like\u00a0steering wheel locks and alarm systems can act as effective safeguards. Combining multiple layers of security can better protect your vehicle against theft.\u00a0Check out how to prevent your car from being stolen.",
      "HOW TO OUTSMART CAR THIEVES WITH THESE SMART AIRTAG TACTICS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags can be a useful device to help you keep track of your vehicle, whether it is lost or stolen, it does not replace the reliability of a GPS system installed in your vehicle if you are trying to outsmart car thieves. Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

      "The report from Independent Women, a nonprofit, released Thursday and shared exclusively with Fox News Digital, says \"male inmates identifying as women are disproportionately likely to have committed sexual offenses, and incarcerated women face heightened risks of harassment and assault under these policies.",
      "\"Placing trans-identifying males, especially those with fully intact male genitalia or a history of violent sex crimes, in close quarters with female inmates risks a serious deprivation of the female\u2019s rights,\" the report states. \"These risks \u2014 and the consequences that have already manifested for women subjected to mixed-sex prison environments \u2014 are known, but are being deliberately ignored in deference to laws and policies that marginalize incarcerated women and silence concerns about their safety.\"",

      "\"It's because the laws are based on self-identification. The only requirement is for someone to state that they are a female,\" Ichikawa told Fox News Digital. \"You can't base your denials on physical attributes, including retention of a penis. You can't deny somebody a transfer based on criminal history.\"",
      "Male inmates who identify as female will often sit before a review board to have cases heard and argue that sex-based prisons violate Equal Protection laws or claim they are being discriminated against on the basis of sex.",

      "\"She was wrong. \u2018Cruel and Unusual Punishment: Stopping the Dangerous Policies Putting Men in Women's Prisons\u2019 makes clear that policy leaders hold clear authority to protect women and enforce sanity. This is a must-read for politicians and their staff trying to end the predations of gender ideology.\"",
      "Transgender policy advocates say housing female-identifying inmates in female-only prisons allows them to live in a safer environment because transgender women face sexual abuse in male-only prisons.",
      "\"Prisons and jails routinely subject transgender people in their care to abusive conditions, including denial of medical care, extended periods of solitary confinement, and harassment, sexual assault, and violence at the hands of guards and other people with whom they are incarcerated,\" the Transgender Law Center states on its website. \"Recent studies show that transgender women are 13 times more likely to be sexually assaulted in prison than others.\"",

      "\"This is a perfect Trojan horse into the biggest victim pool anyone could ever hope and dream of.\"",
      "\"The trans community has been hijacked as a hiding place for very mentally unwell sex criminals,\" Ichikawa said. \"This is a perfect Trojan horse into the biggest victim pool anyone could ever hope and dream of.

      "\"There's no water in the Palisades. There's no water coming out of the fire hydrants. This is an absolute mismanagement by the city. Not the firefighters' fault, but the city's,\" Caruso, a former mayoral candidate, told Fox11 Los Angeles.\"We have got a mayor that is out of the country, and we have got a city that is burning, and there is no resources to put out fires,\" Caruso added. \"It looks like we're in a third-world country here.\"",
      "FOX 11 reported that Bass is currently heading back to California. The mayor reportedly is on a pre-planned trip to Africa.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Aides to Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she was detained Thursday, followed moments later by official denials, in a confusing episode that capped a day of protests seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from clinging to power.",
      "It's not clear exactly what transpired after Machado bid farewell to hundreds of supporters, hopped on a motorcycle and raced with her security convoy through the empty streets of eastern Caracas to an undisclosed location.",
      "At 3:21 p.m. local time, Machado\u2019s press team said in a social media post that security forces \"violently intercepted\" her convoy. Her aides later confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner had been detained, and international condemnation immediately poured from leaders in Latin America and beyond demanding her release.",
      "But about an hour later, a 20-second video of Machado was posted online by a Maduro supporter in which the opposition leader said she was followed after leaving the rally and that she had dropped her purse. \"I'm good, I'm safe,\" Machado said in a raspy voice, adding \"Venezuela will be free.\"",
      "THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TAKE TO THE STREETS AHEAD OF MADURO'S THIRD INAUGURATION",
      "Her aides later said in a social media post that the proof-of-of-life video message had been coerced, and that after recording it she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \"kidnapping\" later.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro supporters denied that she was detained and gloated that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis. \"Nobody should be surprised,\" Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \"Especially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\"They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\" Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hardliner former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies in the opposition leadership fled, joining an exodus of some 7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland in recent years.",
      "Loyalists who control the country's judiciary banned her from running against Maduro last year. In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",
      "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado addresses supporters at a protest against President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, Thursday, Jan. 9, 2025, the day before his inauguration for a third term. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos)",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, invoking the title of president-elect recognized by the U.S. and other countries, was among those who demanded Machado's release in the immediate aftermath of what was believed to be her shock arrest.",
      "\"To the security forces, I warn you: don't play with fire,\" he said in a social media post from the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America.",
      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who\u2019ve witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past.",
      "\"Of course, there\u2019s fewer people,\" said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. \"There\u2019s fear.\"",
      "Those demonstrators that did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",
      "The deployment of security forces as well as pro-government armed groups known as \"colectivos\" to intimidate opponents betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College.",
      "Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners \u2014 who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school.",
      "\"It\u2019s an impressive show of force but it\u2019s also a sign of weakness,\" said Corrales, who co-authored this month an article, \"How Maduro Stole Venezuela\u2019s Vote,\" in the Journal of Democracy.",
      "\"Maduro is safe in office,\" said Corrales, \"but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.\"",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have also recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s president-elect. Even many of Maduro\u2019s former leftist allies in Latin America plan to skip Friday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s request to block criminal proceedings in his hush money case in New York, meaning a sentencing hearing scheduled for Friday can go ahead.",
      "The decision on a 5-4 vote with four conservatives dissenting meant the conservative-majority court changed course after having previously handed Trump two big wins last year. Trump is set to return to the presidency on Jan. 20.",
      "The brief unsigned order said that the issues Trump wants to raise \"can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal.\" The burden sentencing imposes on Trump is \"relatively insubstantial,\" the court added, because Trump is not going to receive any prison time.",
      "The three liberal justices were in the majority with Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett.",
      "Spokespeople for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.",

      "They argued that the case should not go forward because Trump was protected by presidential immunity, as recognized by the Supreme Court in a ruling last year concerning Trump\u2019s prosecution for seeking to overturn the 2020 election results.",
      "The court ruled at the time that while actions taken by presidents in their personal capacity would not be protected, certain official acts taken by presidents are off-limits for criminal prosecution.",
      "A New York appeals court judge declined Tuesday to block Trump\u2019s sentencing.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had urged the court not to intervene, saying in court papers that, because the case is ongoing in lower courts, the justices have no jurisdiction to consider Trump\u2019s claim at this stage. He added that there is a \u201ccompelling public interest\u201d in allowing the sentencing to go ahead following the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.",

Daniels testified that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he has denied.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that some evidence at trial focused on official actions he took in the White House that are protected under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling.

      "Judge\u00a0Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, had postponed Trump\u2019s initial sentencing date in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling.

      "Merchan made it clear last week that the sentencing would not include any prison time for Trump.",
      "The Supreme Court has helped smooth the path to Trump\u2019s regaining office despite the many legal obstacles he has faced in the last few years.",
      "The immunity ruling dealt what proved to be a fatal blow to the election interference prosecution, led by special counsel Jack Smith. In a separate ruling last year, the court also ensured that states could not kick Trump off their ballots under a constitutional provision that bars people who have \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d from holding federal office."

    "story": [
      "Medicare\u2019s drug pricing negotiations \u2014 the first of their kind in the United States, passed under President Joe Biden \u2014 face an uncertain future in the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The deliberations, as mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, are meant to help people on Medicare afford their medications by allowing the government program to directly haggle over prices with drugmakers.",
      "Last year, Medicare reached agreements to lower prices on 10 drugs. The program is supposed to release a list of 15 more prescription drugs selected for the next round of negotiations by Feb. 1. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, may top the list of medications. Other possible candidates include the breast cancer drug Ibrance, Trelegy, an asthma treatment, and Tradjenta, for diabetes.",
      "Although ending the program won\u2019t be easy since it requires authorization from Congress, recent moves by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s allies may not bode well for its future, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Medicare policy program at KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues.",
      "\u201cWe do know in the last Congress legislation was introduced by some Republicans to repeal the entire Inflation Reduction Act and get rid of the drug price negotiation program,\u201d Cubanski said. \u201cWiping the negotiation program off the books was also featured in Project 2025 and other Republican proposals we\u2019ve seen in the past.",
      "\u201cI think there is definitely ideologic support from the Trump administration, or allies of the incoming Trump administration, for getting rid of the negotiation program,\u201d she added.",
      "A political risk",
      "In August, the Biden administration announced lower prices on the 10 costliest prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including Eliquis, a blood thinner from Bristol Myers Squibb; Imbruvica, a blood cancer treatment from AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson; and NovoLog, a diabetes medication from Novo Nordisk. The new prices are set to take effect in 2026.",
      "In 2027, negotiated prices will go into effect for 15 more drugs, followed by another 15 drugs in 2028 and 20 more in each subsequent year should the program remain in place.",
      "The program is expected to save the government and taxpayers billions. The pharmaceutical industry has fiercely fought the program through lawsuits but has so far been unsuccessful.",
      "Trump and prominent members of his health team, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, have remained quiet about whether they plan to support the negotiations or will try to get rid of them.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump\u2019s transition team didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Andrew Mulcahy, a health economist at the Rand Corporation who has advised the Biden administration on the negotiation program, said Trump may want to do away with it simply because it\u2019s one of Biden\u2019s signature legislative achievements.",
      "He noted that Trump also tried to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, one of Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s historic accomplishments, during his first term in office. Trump has continued to threaten to repeal the health care law.",
      "Eliminating Medicare negotiations would be politically risky for Trump, Mulcahy said.",
      "A recent survey from KFF found a quarter of adults say they struggle to afford their medications. Three in 10 say they haven\u2019t taken their medicine as prescribed because of cost.",
      "Republicans haven\u2019t said how they would replace the policy, Mulcahy said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration coming in and saying \u2018Oh, you know what, we\u2019re actually just going to let them stay at whatever high prices they were at\u2019 is tough, tough optics for them,\u201d Mulcahy said.",
      "A win-win for Trump",
      "In a possible twist, keeping the Medicare provision could actually be a political win for Trump, especially if Ozempic makes the list this year, Cubanski said.",
      "Trump could \u201cdeclare victory for patients over the high price of Ozempic by driving a hard bargain and negotiating a steep discount,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump sought to lower drug prices during his first term, said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.",
      "\u201cSupporting negotiations for a lower price for Ozempic would be a win-win for Trump,\u201d Gostin said. \u201cFirst, the drug is enormously popular and is needed particularly among his base. Rural residents tend to suffer more from overweight and diabetes, so making weight loss drugs more affordable would gain wide support.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, Congress has already passed the law, meaning it could be easier for Trump to expand it, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are compelling political reasons to support drug price negotiations,\u201d Gostin said."

      "\u201cOne of the main things was that there was that, I don\u2019t know if you guys remember or not, but the Texas Legislature wasn\u2019t going to allow high school football players to be paid,\u201d Ewers said. \u201cAnd me and my family had a pretty big opportunity in front of us that we felt that it was a good decision for me to go on and forgo my senior year and enroll early at Ohio State and I have the opportunity to have some good money in our pockets as a family.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the final weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House, the focus of his public remarks has not been about the confirmations of his Cabinet picks or on key parts of his campaign agenda like mass deportations or lowering prices.",
      "Instead, Trump \u2014 who has criticized U.S. military involvement in other countries \u2014 is advocating for America to gain more global territory, including by force, if necessary. Call it his annexation agenda.",
      "In recent days, Trump has repeatedly pushed the idea that he will take over Greenland from Denmark, reclaim the Panama Canal after the United States returned it to the Panamanian government decades ago and absorb Canada into the United States. Trump said he is keeping the option of using the military to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal on the table while saying he will exert \u201ceconomic force\u201d to pressure Canada to join the United States. He has also said he wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, North America\u2019s tallest peak.",
      "Panamanian, Danish and Canadian leaders have all shot down Trump\u2019s wishes, with responses ranging from no to not \u201ca snowball\u2019s chance in hell.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s willingness to provoke longtime U.S. allies and throw out unexpected demands gives a glimpse of the domestic, and global, shakeup he hopes to accomplish. Democrats and Republicans who spoke to NBC News, including close Trump allies, said some of his recent demands are serious and some are ways to gain leverage for other parts of his agenda, while others are just trolling.",
      "Greenland is an island Trump very much desires. A person familiar with the discussions said Trump has never given up on acquiring Greenland, which he tried to purchase during his first term for defense reasons and was rebuffed.",
      "This person added that Trump also enjoys the way the effort gets people spun up. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took a trip to Nuuk, the largest population center on the island of about 57,000 people, and the president-elect called in to deliver a message to Greenlanders.",
      "Acquiring the Panama Canal falls into the category of something Trump may want but is also using as an economic pressure campaign.",
      "For years, he has felt that President Jimmy Carter should not have returned the Panama Canal to Panama. But John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser who has since broken with him, told NBC News in an interview that while he served under Trump he didn\u2019t hear any talk of acquiring the Panama Canal (or making Canada the 51st state). The person familiar also said reclaiming the canal was not a focus during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",
      "But it is now on the table because of another part of Trump\u2019s agenda: combating the influence of China.",
      "According to this person and a second person familiar with the discussions, Trump allies have shown the president-elect data they argue shows Chinese encroachment in the Western Hemisphere, including the accusation that Panama has the ability to prioritize Chinese over American shipping. The second person familiar with the discussions said Trump\u2019s threat to take the canal is \u201ca negotiating tool\u201d to get Panama to get more favorable treatment for U.S. shipments.",
      "On Canada, Trump\u2019s remarks amount to \u201can epic troll,\u201d the first person said, adding that he is not serious about absorbing the country into the United States. Yet, this person said, Trump believes his trolling could get some policies to cut his way and help with negotiations. Last month, Canadian officials announced a plan to increase spending on border security, which was a focus of the Republican presidential primary campaign last year.",
      "\u201cI split those into two buckets,\u201d a senior aide to a GOP senator said, noting that the propositions to reclaim the Panama Canal and acquire Greenland are \u201cmore serious,\u201d pointing to Trump Jr.\u2019s visit to Greenland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t take Canada as seriously,\u201d this person added. \u201cHe\u2019s just making fun of [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau.\u201d",

      "Trump and his allies have pointed to national security as the rationale for why the U.S. should acquire Greenland, with Trump posting on his Truth Social platform last month that American \u201cownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\u201d The island, which has been under Denmark\u2019s control since the 14th century, was fully integrated into Denmark in 1953 under the country\u2019s constitution, and it became a self-governing territory in 1979. Greenlanders have full citizenship in Denmark.",
      "Greenland is closer to New York than Copenhagen, and the United States briefly occupied it during World War II. It is home to a large U.S. Air Force base and major mineral reserves. In recent years, China has sought to make inroads on the island.",
      "Carla Sands, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Denmark, said the Danes simply do not have the capacity to properly defend the island, while China\u2019s attempts to boost ties with Greenland have had American officials on high alert.",
      "\u201cWe are great partners and allies with Denmark,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had diplomatic relations with them for 200 years. They\u2019re founding members of NATO. So we\u2019re good friends, but good friends sometimes have to have tough conversations. And one of the conversations was, \u2018How are you going to defend Greenland, part of your kingdom, when you can\u2019t even defend Denmark proper?\u2019\"",
      "\u201cThe only capabilities that Denmark controls for Greenland are defense and foreign policy; everything else Greenland controls,\u201d Sands added. \u201cAnd that makes Greenland really, really vulnerable to bad actors, because they want economic growth.\u201d",
      "But Rufus Gifford, the ambassador to Denmark in the Obama administration and finance chair of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, said gaining Greenland would not be anywhere near as simple as Trump may make it seem.",
      "For starters, Gifford said, \u201cany Danish prime minister that loses Greenland in this day and age would be the laughingstock of the country, and would be forever.\u201d And, he added, Greenlanders may not want to give up their \u201cfairly privileged place in Danish society.\u201d",
      "As far as national security concerns go, Gifford said any military incursion into Greenland would invoke NATO\u2019s Article Five, which requires the alliance\u2019s members to defend it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly concern about Chinese influence in Greenland, and there should be,\u201d he said, adding, though, \u201cthe only reason why you would say that, for national security reasons, Greenland needs to be American would be if you\u2019re threatening to pull out of NATO. And that part is all the scarier.\u201d",
      "When it comes to the Panama Canal, Trump has framed his own focus on U.S. ships being \u201covercharged\u201d to use the waterway, as he said Tuesday, while he believes Chinese ships are getting preferential treatment. Trump also said he long believed Carter was mistaken to have negotiated treaties that turned over control of the canal to Panama.",
      "A Hong Kong-based company operates two of the five ports that serve the canal. China, via its 2020 national security law, has extended its influence over Hong Kong.",
      "Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who said in December that \u201cevery square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to be so,\u201d denied last month that China has influence over the waterway, which the Panama Canal Authority administers.",
      "\u201cIn the president\u2019s universe of alternate facts, he can huff and puff and maybe Panama will return him the canal,\u201d Feeley said. \u201cIn the real world, however, Panama is not about to return the canal. What he has done, in practical political terms, is solidify tremendous support among the 4.3 million Panamanians around Mulino, a relatively new president.\u201d",
      "'A full-on takedown'",
      "Trump has mocked the Canadian government for weeks after he met with Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, to discuss the potential for tariffs of 25% on Canadian goods imported into the United States. He has called Trudeau, who announced his resignation this week, \u201cGov. Trudeau\u201d and suggested Canadians would love to be the 51st state. He has even called for hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, a famous Canadian who has been spotted at Mar-a-Lago, to run for prime minister.",
      "At his news conference Tuesday, Trump said he would use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to merge Canada with the United States, describing the northern border as an \u201cartificially drawn line.\u201d He lamented the United States\u2019 \u201cspending hundreds of billions a year to take care of Canada,\u201d a NATO ally that also shares a military alliance with the United States through North American Aerospace Defense Command.",
      "Following Trump\u2019s comments, Trudeau said on X: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.\u201d",
      "Bolton said the poking at Canada \u201cprobably comes from sitting around the dinner table at Mar-a-Lago and thinking of things to do to make Justin Trudeau unhappy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is trolling,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cHe knows it offends Trudeau to call him \u2018Gov. Trudeau\u2019 and talk about Canada as the 51st state. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much thought beyond that.\u201d",
      "Bolton said it would be wrong to look at Trump\u2019s interest in acquiring foreign territory and conclude he is rolling out a new strategic vision for the United States.",
      "\u201cThere is no philosophy\u201d behind Trump\u2019s statements,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThere is no strategy. This is this week\u2019s series of neuron flashes.\u201d",
      "Coupled with calls from Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and Trump\u2019s sidekick, to replace leadership in the United Kingdom and Germany, Trump is putting immense pressure on some of America\u2019s closest allies before he even takes office. Trudeau\u2019s resignation was, in part, connected to Trump\u2019s pressure campaign and calls to implement sweeping tariffs.",
      "\u201cYou could make the argument that he took down Justin Trudeau just now,\u201d Gifford said, adding: \u201cMusk is trying to do the same in both the U.K. and Germany right now. So this isn\u2019t just like diplomatic pressure. This is like a full-on takedown of some of our best allies.\u201d",
      "Conservative media has boosted Trump\u2019s annexation effort in recent days. On Fox News, prime-time host Sean Hannity has promoted it as a wise endeavor. Then, the New York Post, one of Trump\u2019s favorite publications, highlighted the \u201cDonroe Doctrine\u201d on its Wednesday cover, a play on President James Monroe\u2019s 19th century outline of the U.S. role in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Congressional Republicans are already pushing legislation to advance the agenda. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., plans to introduce a bill Thursday that would allow Trump to \u201center into negotiations for the reacquisition of the Panama Canal.\u201d And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced moments after Trump called to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America\u201d on Tuesday that she would introduce legislation in the House to do so.",
      "The first person familiar with the discussions told NBC News that Trump first expressed interest in changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico last month and that the president-elect was fixated on the idea, though people close to him do not believe he can do much it.  But this person said Trump\u2019s push to rename Denali back to Mount McKinley is serious, and unlike changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, changing the name is fully within the power of the U.S. government. Obama changed the name from Mount McKinley to Denali, its earlier name, in 2015.",
      "Democrats have offered a mixed response to the agenda. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Tuesday on X that he \u201cwould welcome\u201d Greenland as the 53rd state \u201cright after we admit Puerto Rico and Washington DC.\u201d And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that he would \u201cagree to working with Donald Trump on renaming the Gulf of Mexico, only if he first agrees to work with us on an actual plan to lower costs for Americans.\u201d",
      "But with Democrats struggling to find their footing in the second Trump administration, a Pennsylvania Democrat expressed worry that Trump\u2019s effort, if it succeeds, could be detrimental to the party\u2019s chances at the ballot box.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say somehow Donald Trump buys Greenland and renames [the Gulf of Mexico] the Gulf of America,\u201d this person said. \u201cThere are millions and millions of voters who will go: \u2018Well, he did that. I don\u2019t even know what Democrats do.\u2019\u201d",

      "Micki Witthoeft, Ashli Babbit\u2019s mother, said at a nightly vigil outside of the D.C. jail in support of Jan. 6 defendants on Wednesday that Trump had called her when she was in the back of an Uber with two other supporters of Jan. 6 defendants, coming back from laying down flowers in honor of her daughter.",
      "\u201cTell them I love them, to keep their chins up,\u201d Trump said when asked if he had a message for Jan. 6 defendants, according to Witthoeft.",
      "\"I know that he is still thinking about these guys, and I have a feeling it is going to be a happy day for us,\" when Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, Witthoeft said.",
      "The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. But Trump has called Witthoeft and into the vigil before, given financial support to Jan. 6 defendants and promised to pardon an untold number of them upon taking office.",
      "\"We have a lot to look forward to on Jan. 20, and God Bless America,\" Witthoeft said. \"Trump town, baby!\"",
      "Trump has vowed to pardon a number of the more than 1,270 defendants who have been convicted on Jan. 6 charges ranging from unlawful parading to seditious conspiracy. There are more than 700 defendants who have either already completed their sentences or were never given any jail or prison time to begin with, which would give Trump an opportunity to pardon potentially hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants without having much of a practical impact, beyond the message that such an action would send.",
      "This week, an attorney for the Jan. 6 defendant serving the longest sentence \u2014 former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio, who is serving 22 years after being convicted of seditious conspiracy \u2014 asked Trump for a full pardon.",
      "While more than 1,580 defendants have already been arrested, that's only roughly half of the total number of defendants who could have been charged for either entering the Capitol or assaulting law enforcement officers outside the building.",
      "In addition to those already charged, more than 200 people suspected of assaulting law enforcement officers have been identified, according to online \u201csedition hunters\u201d who have aided the FBI in hundreds of cases against Jan. 6 rioters. While the statute of limitations on crimes committed on Jan. 6, 2021, doesn't expire until early 2026, it's unclear if the Trump administration will allow investigations into individuals accused of assaulting law enforcement officers that day to continue."

      "In a decision issued Thursday, U.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves scrapped the entire 1,500-page regulation after deciding it was \u201cfatally\u201d tainted by legal shortcomings. The rule had already been halted in 26 states after a wave of legal challenges by Republican states.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump previously promised to end the rules \u201con day one\u201d and made anti-transgender themes a centerpiece of his campaign.",
      "The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia.",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti called it a rejection of the Biden administration\u2019s \u201crelentless push to impose a radical gender ideology.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause the Biden rule is vacated altogether, President Trump will be free to take a fresh look at our Title IX regulations when he returns to office,\u201d Skrmetti said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately comment on the decision.",
      "The Biden administration ignited controversy when it finalized the new rules last year. The regulation expanded Title IX, a 1972 law forbidding discrimination based on sex in education, to also prevent discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. It also widened the definition of harassment to include a broader range of misconduct.",
      "Civil rights advocates hailed it as a victory, saying it gave LGBTQ students new recourse against discrimination. But it drew outrage from conservatives who said it could be used to protect transgender athletes in girls\u2019 sports.",
      "The rule didn\u2019t explicitly address athletics and mostly detailed how schools and colleges were required to respond to cases of discrimination and sexual assault. A separate proposal dealing with transgender athletes in sports was put on the back burner and later revoked after it became a focal point of Trump\u2019s campaign.",
      "In his decision, Reeves found the Education Department overstepped its authority by expanding the scope of Title IX.",
      "There\u2019s nothing in the 1972 law suggesting that it should cover any more than it has since Congress created it, Reeves wrote. He called it an \u201cattempt to bypass the legislative process and completely transform Title IX.\u201d",
      "The judge also found that it violated free speech rights by requiring teachers to use pronouns aligning with a student\u2019s gender identity.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment does not permit the government to chill speech or compel affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees in this manner,\u201d Reeves wrote.",
      "Rather than carve out certain aspects of the rule, Reeves decided it was best to toss the regulation in its entirety and revert to a previous interpretation of Title IX. He said his decision will \u201csimply \u2019cause a return to the status quo\u2019 that existed for more than 50 years prior to its effective date.\u201d",
      "Among the biggest critics of the rule was Betsy DeVos, former education secretary during Trump\u2019s first term. On the social media site X, she wrote that the \u201cradical, unfair, illegal, and absurd Biden Title IX re-write is GONE.\u201d",
      "Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said Biden\u2019s rule \u201cbetrayed the original intent of Title IX by removing longstanding protections that ensured fairness for women and girls.\u201d",

      "Democrats recalibrate on immigration after bruising defeat to Trump",
      "After the issue served as a political albatross for them in the last election, Democrats are taking steps in the early days of the new Congress to recalibrate on immigration.",
      "Scores of Democrats are supporting the first bill to hit the floor of both GOP-led chambers this year: the Laken Riley Act, named for the 22-year-old Georgia nursing school student who was murdered last year by an immigrant in the United States illegally.",
      "The legislation would require ICE to take custody of people in the country illegally and detain them over theft-related crimes. It would target people who are charged, arrested or convicted of committing an act of \u201cburglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting,\u201d according to the bill text.",

And voters who cited immigration as a top issue backed Trump over Harris 89% to 9%, according to the exit poll.",

Others say they\u2019re only voting to begin debate, and aren\u2019t committed to voting for the bill.",

    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Thursday she supported the recent interest rate cuts but doesn\u2019t see the need to go any further.",
      "In a speech to bankers in California that was part monetary policy, part regulation, Bowman said concerns she has that inflation has held \u201cuncomfortably above\u201d the Fed\u2019s 2% goal lead her to believe that the\u00a0quarter percentage point reduction in December\u00a0should be the last one for the current cycle.",
      "\u201cI supported the December policy action because, in my view, it represented the [Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s] final step in the policy recalibration phase,\u201d the central banker said in prepared remarks. Bowman added that the current policy rate is near what she thinks of as \u201cneutral\u201d that neither supports nor restrains growth.",
      "Despite the progress that has been made, there are \u201cupside risks to inflation,\u201d Bowman added. The Fed\u2019s\u00a0preferred inflation gauge\u00a0showed a rate of 2.4% in November but was at 2.8% when excluding food and energy, a core measure that officials see as a better long-run indicator.",
      "\u201cThe rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but this progress appears to have stalled last year with core inflation still uncomfortably above the Committee\u2019s 2 percent goal,\u201d Bowman added.",
      "The remarks come the day after the\u00a0FOMC released minutes\u00a0from the Dec. 17-18 meeting that showed other members also were concerned with how inflation is running, though most expressed confidence it will drift back toward the 2% goal, eventually getting there in 2027. The Fed sliced a full percentage point off its key borrowing rate from September through December.",
      "In fact, other Fed speakers this week provided views contrary to that of Bowman, who is generally regarded as one of the committee\u2019s more hawkish members, meaning she prefers a more aggressive approach to controlling inflation that includes higher interest rates.",
      "In a speech delivered Wednesday in Paris, Governor\u00a0Christopher Waller had a more optimistic take\u00a0on inflation, saying that imputed, or estimated, prices that feed into inflation data are keeping rates high, while observed prices are showing moderation. He expects \u201cfurther reductions will be appropriate\u201d to the Fed\u2019s main policy rate, which currently sits in a range between 4.25%-4.5%.",
      "Earlier Thursday, regional Presidents Susan Collins of Boston and Patrick Harker of Philadelphia both expressed confidence the Fed will be able to lower rates this year, if it a slower pace than previously thought. The FOMC at the December meeting priced in the equivalent of two quarter-point cuts this year, as opposed to the four expected at the September meeting.",
      "Still, as a governor Bowman is a permanent voter on the FOMC and will get a say this year on policy. She is also considered one of the favorites to be named the vice chair of supervision for the banking industry after President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0takes office later this month.",
      "Speaking of the incoming administration, Bowman advised her colleagues to refrain from \u201cprejudging\u201d what Trump might do on issues such as tariffs and immigration. The December minutes indicated concerns from officials over what the initiatives could mean for the economy.",
      "At the same time, Bowman expressed concern about loosening policy too much. She cited strong stock market gains and rising Treasury yields as indications that interest rates were restraining economic activity and tamping down inflation.",
      "\u201cIn light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The wind-driven wildfires burning out of control in the Los Angeles area couldn't have emerged at a more perilous moment for California's homeowners, as officials try to rehab what they concede is a deepening \"insurance crisis.\"",
      "\"We were all thinking 2025 is going to be the year insurers regain their appetite for the market in California, but having this catastrophe hit us right out of the gate is really unfortunate,\" said Amy Bach, the executive director of United Policyholders, a California-based nonprofit consumer group.",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "\"Up until this latest disaster,\" she said, \"we thought we might be turning a corner.\"",
      "The state Department of Insurance issued a new regulation last month meant to turn the tide of some of the largest insurance companies' refusal to take on new customers in California or decisions not to renew policies of current ones. Under the rule, insurance companies are permitted to pass on the cost of reinsurance to consumers, although at an amount that can't exceed an industry standard.",
      "Reinsurance is protection that insurance companies acquire to shield themselves from catastrophic claim events.",
      "The Insurance Department said California had been the only state that didn't allow the cost to be passed on.",
      "In return, insurers doing business in the state must again provide coverage in fire-prone areas at a mandated amount. Another rule finalized last month allows insurers to incorporate catastrophe modeling into their rates on the condition that they increase their policy offerings in underserved areas of the state.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a previous statement. \"This is a historic moment for California.\"",
      "The actions, however, drew scrutiny from consumer advocates who worry it will only lead to sharply increased premiums.",
      "Lara's office didn't immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment in the wake of the latest wildfires.",
      "The ongoing Palisades Fire is poised to become one of the state's costliest: Fire officials said Wednesday that more than 11,800 acres have been destroyed and that 1,000 structures have been burned, while a J.P. Morgan Insurance analysis estimates\u00a0insured losses from that blaze alone could approach $10 billion. At least four other significant fires have erupted, as well.",
      "The J.P. Morgan analysts note that the area of the Palisades Fire is \"an affluent residential area, with a median home price\" exceeding $3 million.",
      "Bach said homeowners in California might pay anywhere from $1,000 to upward of $40,000 a year to insure their properties.",
      "While no law mandates that property owners in the state must carry insurance, those with mortgages are required to have it. Typical property insurance policies, however, don't generally cover damage from disasters such as earthquakes, floods and landslides. Separate insurance policies are required to protect against those types of calamities.",
      "The concern isn't whether insurance companies will pay out for damage but rather how much and how long it will take, Bach said.",
      "\"For the people who lose their homes in these wildfires, there will be fights over coverage,\" she said.",
      "But that's if they have insurance at all.",
      "In the wealthy Pacific Palisades neighborhood ravaged by the wildfires, some homeowners were blindsided in March when State Farm announced it would stop renewing their coverage.",
      "State Farm, the largest home insurer in California, said its decision was \"not made lightly.\" It blamed costs associated with inflation, catastrophe exposure, reinsurance and regulations for its need to protect 'its bottom line.",
      "The devastation wrought by wildfires in particular, leading to tens of billions of dollars' worth of insured property losses in California over the past decade, has only grown more intense as climate change leads to rising temperatures, longer fire seasons and heightened drought conditions.",
      "State Farm said in a nonrenewal letter provided to the state that the 30,000 property insurance policyholders who were being dropped across California lived in areas deemed to \"present the most substantial wildfire or fire following earthquake hazards.\" Los Angeles' Westside region was hardest-hit by the company's decision, which went into effect last summer. In Pacific Palisades, more than 1,600 policies weren't renewed.",
      "State Farm had already said in 2023 that it would no longer offer home insurance to new customers in California, in part because of catastrophe exposure. Allstate, the sixth-largest home insurer in California, also said that year it was halting new policies in the state.",
      "Asked about its homeowner coverage in the areas affected by the wildfires, State Farm said in a statement Wednesday that its \"number one priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "California does have an insurance program under the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, established in the 1960s, which provides fire insurance coverage for high-risk properties. The coverage is basic and funded by the insurance companies.",
      "While it's meant as a last resort for homeowners, its use has only soared in recent years, from nearly 154,500 residential policies in September 2019 to more than 408,400 in June \u2014 creating a high risk exposure that state officials say was never intended.",
      "But there had been a glimmer that some insurance companies are willing to fill the voids in the market. On Tuesday, Mercury Insurance, an independent home insurer in California, announced it would begin writing new homeowners insurance policies in the town of\u00a0Paradise,\u00a0the site of the deadly\u00a0Camp Fire\u00a0in 2018, which is considered to be the worst wildfire in modern state history.",
      "Janet Ruiz, the chief spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the insurance industry, told NBC Bay Area that the reality is companies have to manage how much they can handle in the face of destructive wildfires and rising reconstruction costs.",
      "\"California is the fourth-largest insurance market in the world,\" Ruiz said. \"We want to be here, we want to be a part of it, but we do need to make some profit.\"",
      "Bach said that if the state succeeds in motivating insurance companies to get back into the market and become competitive, it could be a benefit for consumers.",
      "But she said she worries that the latest wildfires may only have an opposite effect on already skittish insurers.",
      "\"Home insurance is an essential good that the private market is increasingly unwilling to provide,\" Bach said. \"We are at a crossroads.\""

      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had urged the court not to intervene, saying in court papers that, because the case is ongoing in lower courts, the justices have no jurisdiction to consider Trump\u2019s claim at this stage.

Daniels testified that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he has denied.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that some evidence at trial focused on official actions he took in the White House that are protected under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling. They also took the unprecedented step of saying a president-elect should have the same protection from criminal prosecution that a sitting president has.",
      "Judge\u00a0Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, had postponed Trump\u2019s initial sentencing date in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling. But he later determined Trump does not have immunity until he is sworn in as president and directed\u00a0Trump\u2019s sentencing\u00a0on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to take place Friday morning.",
      "Merchan made it clear last week that the sentencing would not include any prison time for Trump.",
      "The Supreme Court has helped smooth the path to Trump\u2019s regaining office despite the many legal obstacles he has faced in the last few years.",
      "The immunity ruling dealt what proved to be a fatal blow to the election interference prosecution, led by special counsel Jack Smith. In a separate ruling last year, the court also ensured that states could not kick Trump off their ballots under a constitutional provision that bars people who have \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d from holding federal office."

      "Part 1 of the \"Abbott Elementary\" and \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" crossover aired on Wednesday, Jan. 8, at 8:30 p.m. ET/PT.",
      "The second crossover is expected later in 2025, but Season 17 of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" has yet to get a premiere date.",
      "Rob McElhenney told Rolling Stone in an interview that the second crossover with \"Abbott Elementary\" will air \"four or five months\" after the first.",
      "What happened in Part 1 of the crossover?",
      "According to a description of the episode, Ava (Janelle James) \"announces the school district is sending a group of volunteers to help out at Abbott.\" Unfortunately, \"things don't go as planned\" when they arrive.",
      "In the episode, called \"Volunteers,\" the \"It's Always Sunny\" crew arrives at Abbott to fulfill a community service requirement after a crime spree.",
      "Janine (Quinta Brunson) gets help from Dee (Kaitlin Olson) in the classroom, before Dee develops a crush on Janine's boyfriend, Gregory (Tyler James Williams), sparking an intense, one-sided rivalry.",
      "Elsewhere, Mac (Rob McElhenney) tries to butter up Ava (\"Let me know if there's anything you need, and I mean anything,\" he says) in order to get her signature and sign off on their volunteering time early. Janitor Mr. Johnson (William Stanford Davis) and newcomer Frank (Danny DeVito) fight over how best to repel raccoons in the school's garden and fittingly exchange insults over who is more \"trash\"-like.",
      "But the groups don't completely disagree. Charlie (Charlie Day) spends time with Jacob (Chris Perfetti), Melissa (Lisa Ann Walter) and Barbara (Sheryl Lee Ralph), and the teachers realize he struggles to read. After helping him sound out words in a picture book, Charlie is honored at a \"moving up\" ceremony to show his mastery of the kindergarten reading level.",
      "Dennis (Glenn Howerton) largely remains missing from the episode. After realizing that the Abbott teachers are being filmed (intrinsic to its mockumentary format), Dennis hides from the cameras.",
      "\"I know quite a bit about filming and consent, and I think I'll be spending my time on the other side of the camera, thank you very much,\" Dennis says.",
      "What has the cast said about the crossover?",
      "In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, McElhenney said he and Brunson were eager to do a two-part crossover.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s what we keyed in on very early. That would be the most fun because we get to play the same characters in the tone of 'Abbott,' and they get to play the same characters from 'Abbott' in the tone of 'Sunny.' That\u2019s what will allow us to satisfy the authenticity of each show but then also stretch and do something different,\" he said.",
      "What will happen in the second crossover episode?",
      "Part 2 of the crossover will air at a later date since production on Season 17 of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" recently finished, per the Los Angeles Times.",
      "When determining which episode would air first, McElhenney said it made the most sense to start with \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think just by nature of the schedule. In some ways, you look at the \u2018Abbott\u2019 episode, and it stands on its own, and it\u2019s so great, and it\u2019s a fully realized story,\" McElhenney said.",
      "But the \"It's Always Sunny\" episode will cast the episode \u2014 and its jokes \u2014 in a new light.",
      "\"Then when you see our episode, it feels like it\u2019s almost like a giant setup, and then this is the punchline,\" he said. \"But then you can watch them in either order, and they both make sense.\"",
      "The crossover episode of \"Abbott Elementary\" ended with the gang meeting their volunteer hours requirement and leaving the school, to the Abbott teachers' relief.",
      "The next crossover will be told through the \"prism of 'Sunny,'\" McElhenney said.",
      "Could the \"Abbott Elementary\" cast stop by Paddy's Pub? After all, Melissa has already been\u00a0\u2014 though she called it \u201cthe skeeviest bar\u201d she's ever been to."

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 15:32:54 GMT",
    "summary": "What is the meaning of Zendaya's engagement ring? Jewelers break down the meaning, style, setting carats and price of the diamond. Inside the east west diamond.",
    "story": [
      "When Zendaya walked the Golden Globes red carpet on Jan. 5, it wasn\u2019t her and long-time stylist Law Roach\u2019s ability to perfect a look that caught people\u2019s attention.",
      "It was the diamond rock perched on her left ring finger.",
      "Fans began speculating Zendaya was wearing an engagement ring, indicating she and Tom Holland had decided to take the next step in their relationship.",
      "TMZ and People reported the engagement on Jan. 6, citing sources close to the couple. TODAY.com has reached out to Zendaya and Holland for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Zendaya is keeping mum \u2014 but her ring tells a story, jewelry experts say.",
      "Laura Taylor, an engagement ring specialist at the U.K. based jewelry brand Lorel Diamonds, estimates the diamond in Zendaya\u2019s ring comes in at about five carats. The stone has a horizontal, or \u201ceast-west,\u201d orientation and is set a Georgian-style cut-down, also called a button-back setting. The ring is two-tone, featuring both gold and silver-hued metals.",
      "The effect, Taylor says, is the perfect example of \u201cOld Hollywood glamour with a modern twist.\u201d The cushion-cut diamond and the button-back setting give the ring vintage familiarity, whereas the east-west orientation and mixed metals make it feel edgy.",
      "Typically found in antiques, the button-back setting is unique because the jewel is fully encircled with metal and prongs (in this case, six), allowing it to sit lower on the band. Taylor calls the low setting a \u201cpractical\u201d choice with an heirloom feel.",
      "The east-west orientation, an alternative to the more typical vertical style, also gives the ring an edge. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle yet confident way to say, \u2018We\u2019re doing this our way,\u2019\u201d Taylor says.",
      "The east-west orientation also symbolizes \u201cequal partnership and commitment,\u201d Julia Briggs Parsons, founder and CEO of luxury jewelry brand Incredible Rising, says.",
      "Jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 believes the ring was designed by Jessica McCormack. TODAY.com has reached out to the jeweler for comment. \u201cShe\u2019s giving quiet luxury \u2014 Jessica McCormack is very, \u2018If you know, you know,\u2019\u201d Chaf\u00e9 says.",
      "Based on the brand and the size of the stone, Chaf\u00e9 estimates the ring cost over $200,000.",
      "Initially, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised the ring was not designed by Bulgari, as Zendaya is an ambassador for the luxury brand. In fact, Zendaya and Bulgari\u2019s long relationship was a clue into the engagement. At the Golden Globes, Bulgari took credit for all of Zendaya\u2019s jewelry \u2014 except the ring on her left hand.",
      "The seemingly deliberate choice by the couple makes the ring all the more personal. \u201cThis engagement ring looks like it\u2019s been handed down through generations of love stories,\u201d Taylor says.",
      "Uniquely theirs, jewelers also predict features in Zendaya's ring, like the button-back setting and east-west orientation, will rise in popularity, just like Selena Gomez's recent engagement ring may do for marquise cuts.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m very fortunate. The man that I am married to is Senator Vincent Hughes, seventh Senatorial district of Pennsylvania,\u201d she told the publication.",
      "She continued, \u201cYou fall in love with somebody and you realize he\u2019s not leaving his career. He\u2019s not leaving Philadelphia. I\u2019m not leaving Hollywood. When you have children, it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d",

After all, they have two previous seasons of the show to review to devise their strategy.",
      "But the show\u2019s Emmy-winning host, the deliciously larger-than-life Alan Cumming, tells TODAY.com that the show\u2019s producers are always one step ahead of the contestants.",
      "\u201cThey did all these twists. Extra twists. It was really twisty,\u201d Cumming says gleefully in the TODAY greenroom just after chatting with host Savannah Guthrie in Studio 1A. \u201cI actually thought, \u2018Are there too many twists?\u2019 But when I saw it, it\u2019s great.\u201d",
      "Cumming enjoys watching the contestants scheme and stumble through the game on television monitors in his dressing room \u2014 which he refers to as \u201ca James Bond baddies lair\u201d \u2014 while he makes his breakfast and hangs out with Lala, his canine co-host.",

      "The host, who always appears so self-possessed on screen, says that he had his own anxieties during filming one particular scene: the traitors selection at the first Round Table.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly stressful, and I feel I could sort of screw up the entire show in one fell swoop if I got it wrong,\u201d he shares.",
      "Cumming says that while the contestants sit around the table blindfolded, he circles the room \u201chundreds\u201d of times. He taps every contestant on the shoulder, both to capture the moment on camera and to demonstrate to contestants what it feels like to be selected as a traitor. Then Cumming continues to circle, making theatrical motions with his arms to add a bit of confusion to the process. He even goes around the table backward.",
      "At the same time, Cumming can hear discussion from the control room in his earpiece, increasing his own tension. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy when it\u2019s over,\u201d he says.",
      "Cumming knows that the round table was a success if he hears contestants dissecting his movements.",
      "\u201cI love it when they go, \u2018I heard the cloth of his jacket moving.\u2019 Then I go, \u2018Nailed it!\u2019\u201d he says jubilantly.",

      "The free publicity from Musk was a potential boon for AfD, which has been frozen out of mainstream German politics, in part, because its leaders have downplayed Nazi atrocities.

On Tuesday, the Party of European Socialists protested against Musk\u2019s plans in a statement and asked the European Union to \u201cuse all the legal means available to protect democracy against misinformation and foreign interference on social media.\u201d X is already under investigation for potential violations of the union\u2019s Digital Services Act.",

      "While 12 previous attempts have failed to choose a successor to former President Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022, there are indications that Thursday\u2019s vote may produce a head of state.",
      "The leading candidate is Lebanese army commander Joseph Aoun, no relation to the former president. He is widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild after a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.",
      "Hezbollah previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad.",

The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected.",
      "As a sitting army commander, Joseph Aoun is technically barred from becoming president by Lebanon\u2019s constitution. The ban has been waived before, but it means that Aoun faces additional procedural hurdles.",
      "Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round.",
      "But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun would need a two-thirds majority even in the second round.",
      "Other contenders include Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon\u2019s General Security agency.",
      "A president is needed to appoint a permanent prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president.",

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 The Biden administration has been in talks with the Taliban to exchange Americans detained in Afghanistan for Afghans in U.S. custody, a senior Taliban leader with direct knowledge of the negotiations told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The Taliban leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said the two sides had been negotiating for the past two years but had so far failed to reach a deal.",
      "He said the Taliban had demanded three Afghan nationals, including Muhammad Rahim, the only Afghan prisoner left at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, a detention site in Cuba for the mostly Muslim men taken into custody around the world in the U.S. \u201cwar on terror.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials say Rahim, who has been held there without charge since 2008, was a senior aide in Al Qaeda, the terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden that carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Others say he held a much lesser role as a courier and translator and is not a national security threat.",
      "\u201cHis mother has been protesting and made several demands for his release,\u201d the Taliban leader said.",
      "The Taliban leader, who said he has participated in some of the meetings with U.S. officials, confirmed that the Taliban had captured three American nationals in the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that the U.S. administration will make it happen as they are very interested in getting back their three nationals currently held in Afghanistan,\u201d he said.",
      "He did not name the three Americans, who he said were accused of spying and preaching Christianity in Afghanistan. The Taliban have previously confirmed they are holding Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann, both of whom the State Department has classified as wrongfully detained.",
      "Corbett, a longtime resident of Afghanistan before the U.S. withdrawal, was arrested on a business trip to the country in August 2022, while Glezmann was arrested during a trip in December of that year. Both men are said to have experienced declining health during their detention.",
      "The Taliban have not confirmed whether they are holding a third person, Mahmood Habibi, a naturalized American who worked for an American consulting group and was arrested in his native Afghanistan in August 2022 after the U.S. drone strike that killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.",
      "In addition to Rahim, the Taliban leader said, Afghan officials also demanded the release of two other Afghan nationals imprisoned in the United States who \u201chave nothing to do with terrorism or politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe charges leveled against them are different, and we will hopefully get them back to Afghanistan,\u201d he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement that \u201cthe safety and security of Americans overseas is one of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s top priorities, and we are working around the clock to ensure George, Ryan, and Mahmood\u2019s safe return.\"",
      "The spokesperson said that \"President Biden and his team continue to work, often in partnership with key allies, to negotiate for the release of Americans held hostage or unjustly detained abroad so that they can be reunited with their families, and the Administration will do so throughout the remainder of the term.\u201d",
      "According to a 2014 Senate report, the CIA subjected Rahim, who was captured in Pakistan, to \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques that included sleep deprivation sessions lasting up to almost six days. They did not produce any intelligence.",
      "Rahim is ineligible to leave Guant\u00e1namo, having been deemed a continuing national security threat by a federal review panel multiple times, most recently in November 2023.",
      "The U.S.-Taliban negotiations were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "In the past four years, Biden has brought back more than 75 American citizens and residents detained around the world, including three from China in a prisoner swap this fall and four from Russia in a multinational prisoner swap last summer. In 2022, Biden approved the release of an Afghan drug lord in U.S. custody in exchange for Navy veteran Mark Frerichs, who was held captive in Afghanistan for 2\u00bd years.",
