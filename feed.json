      "Fans of Jane Austen are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the beloved author's birth with costumed balls and themed events",
      "LONDON -- Ellie Potts goes dancing with her friends most weeks. They don\u2019t put on the latest Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran, though \u2014 they much prefer English country dances that were popular more than 200 years ago.",
      "As the music starts, about two dozen men and women curtsy and bow, extend a gloved hand to their partner, before dancing in circles or skipping in elaborate patterns around each other.",
      "Like many of her fellow Hampshire Regency Dancers, Potts is a devotee of Jane Austen and all things from the Regency period. Not only have they studied the books and watched all the screen adaptations \u2014 they also research the music, make their own period dresses, and immerse themselves in dances Austen and her characters would have enjoyed in centuries past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been interested in Jane Austen since I was about 8 or 9,\u201d said Potts, 25. \u201cI mainly joined (the dance group) so I can have balls and things to go to in my costumes, but I really got into it. I\u2019ve been surprised how much I enjoy the dancing.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no shortage of grand costumed balls and historical dancing this year, which marks the 250th anniversary of Austen\u2019s birth. This weekend, thousands of fans who call themselves \u201cJaneites\u201d are descending on the city of Bath for a 10-day festival celebrating the beloved author of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d and \u201cSense and Sensibility.\u201d",
      "The highlight is a Regency costumed promenade on Saturday, where some 2,000 people in their finest bonnets, bows and costumes will parade through the streets of Bath. Organizers say the extravaganza holds the Guinness World Record for the \u201clargest gathering of people dressed in Regency costumes.\u201d",
      "Bonny Wise, from Indiana, is attending her sixth Jane Austen festival in Bath. This time she\u2019s bringing four period dresses she made, and will lead a tour group of 25 Austen enthusiasts from all over the United States.",
      "\u201cI started planning a tour four years ago, when I realized this was a big year for Jane,\u201d said Wise, 69. She credited the 1995 adaptation of \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d with sparking her obsession.",
      "\u201cThat movie just opened up a whole new world for me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start with the books, the movies, then you start getting into the hats, the tea, the manners \u2026 one thing just led to another.\u201d",
      "Wise said she loves the wit, humor and social observations in Austen\u2019s books. She also finds the author\u2019s own life story inspiring.",
      "\u201cI admire Jane and what she managed as a woman in that era, her perseverance and her process of becoming an author,\u201d she said.",
      "The Jane Austen Society of North America, the world\u2019s largest organization devoted to the author, says it has seen a recent influx of younger fans, though most of its members \u2014 5,000 to date \u2014 skew older.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re growing all the time because Jane Austen is timeless,\u201d said Mary Mintz, the group\u2019s president. \u201cWe have members from Japan, India. They come from every continent except Antarctica.\u201d",
      "Many festival-goers will be making a pilgrimage to Steventon, the small village in rural Hampshire, southern England, where Austen was born in 1775.",

      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an escape for a lot of people,\u201d Timbs added. \u201cPerhaps it's to escape the speed, noise and abrasiveness of the era in which we find ourselves, and a longing to return to the elegance and indulgent pleasures of what was really a very fleeting period in history.\u201d",

      "Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits",
      "NEW YORK -- Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits. \u201cPlay,\u201d his eighth studio album out Friday, stays in that familiar lane for the most part.",
      "In his quest, Sheeran has maintained an everyman quality by carefully evolving with the status quo (while, largely, removing himself from public discourse, save his copyright court win and more recent promotional pop-ups in everyman places, like a New York City ice cream shop just this week). The aesthetic of Ed Sheeran, global star, still matches that of Ed Sheeran, up-and-coming troubadour. Most of the time, it's still just Sheeran, his guitar and his loop pedal against the world.",
      "Of course, Sheeran, like most pop stars, knows that as his stardom has risen and his audience widened, the meaning of that relatability has shifted. His listeners, over a decade in, know that too. So \u201cPlay,\u201d the first project in a new series from Sheeran named for symbols (he's said \u201cRewind\u201d will be next), uses Sheeran's global acclaim to his advantage \u2014 without straying too far from his singer-songwriter roots.",
      "Recorded throughout his \u201cMathematics World Tour\u201d and finished in Goa, India, the project feels split. There are moments that herald the return of Sheeran the hitmaker, an exciting development after his last two albums \u2014 the final chapter of his mathematics series, \u201cSubtract,\u201d and the folk-pop \u201cAutumn Variations\u201d \u2014 were well received but failed to produce the kind of chart-toppers that created Sheeran, the megastar. Most tracks, however, fall more in line with those albums, deviating little from the narrative songwriting toolkit that raised Sheeran, the artist.",
      "Sheeran turned to new collaborators for a couple songs that are already established hits. The addictive \u201cSapphire\u201d features Indian singer Arijit Singh, who ranks among Spotify's most popular artists globally. A Farsi version of the single \u201cAzizam,\u201d written and produced with Ilya Salmanzadeh, Savan Kotecha and Johnny McDaid, was released in April featuring Iranian singer Googoosh. Sheeran isn't just eyeing the U.S. and U.K. charts here \u2014 he's playing for cross-cultural domination, and having fun while doing it.",
      "The rest of the tracks, those that feel more classically Sheeran, see old themes recycled: \u201cOld Phone\u201d provides him the space to remember old friends and reminisce about his changing personal life, just as the landscape in 2017's \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d provided a tangible marker of memory. The conceit of the sappily sweet \u201cCamera\u201d \u2014 \u201cI don't need a camera to capture this moment\u201d \u2014 comes in conflict with that of Sheeran's own beloved \u201cPhotograph\u201d from 2014's \u201cMultiply.\u201d",
      "There are still moments that feel like they'll stick: Sheeran's ode to his daughters, \u201cFor Always,\u201d with cooing backing vocals from co-writer Amy Allen, is sure to be a favorite father-daughter dance track, right behind the groovy \u201cThe Vow\u201d on wedding playlists.",
      "Sheeran flexes his pen on \u201cOpening,\u201d the album's first track. Bounded by glittery verses about boundaries, he raps about his family, his mental health, that court case, fame and what comes next. \u201cBeen a long time up top but I ain\u2019t complacent/If I look down I can see replacements,\u201d he raps at one point. \u201cGotta make dreams and chase them.\u201d",
      "Sheeran wants to be for everyone. And to do that, he'll still be an everyman.",

      "Real moviegoer energy has always made the Toronto International Film Festival a good measuring stick for not just what might catch on during Hollywood\u2019s awards season but what will click with audiences",
      "TORONTO -- Anyone will tell you it\u2019s the audiences that make the Toronto International Film Festival. They aren\u2019t purely industry folks, like they are in Cannes or Venice, but more boisterous, enthusiastic moviegoers with their own rituals, like growling like buccaneers at the piracy warning that plays before each screening.",
      "That real-moviegoer energy has always made TIFF a good measuring stick for not just what might catch on during Hollywood\u2019s awards season, but also what will click with audiences. Yet there might be no more endangered species in today\u2019s film industry than the kind of crowd-pleaser that thrives in Toronto.",
      "More than most years, this year\u2019s festival, which wraps up this weekend, has been a veritable ark for the castaways of today\u2019s Hollywood: star-driven dramas, big-screen comedies, adult-oriented movies without a whiff of franchise about them. All struggled to reach the screen in the first place. But for many of these movies, the fight to reach audiences is just getting started.",
      "One of the standouts was Derek Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cRoofman,\u201d a stranger-than-fiction true tale about a North Carolina man (Channing Tatum) imprisoned for robbing dozens of McDonald's by burrowing in from their roofs. He escapes prison and, instead of trying to outrun the authorities, hides out for weeks inside a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Cianfrance, the grittily realistic filmmaker of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d and \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d uses the story as a funny and oddly moving examination of box-store materialism. Paramount will release it Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cWhen I was shopping it around, a lot of people were saying, \u2018We don\u2019t make movies like this anymore,\u2019\u201d Cianfrance said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s one of the reasons why there are so many production credits on the front of the movie. I had to get it from everywhere to be able to do it.\u201d",
      "The movie industry is coming off a summer that fell painfully shy of expectations. May-to-Labor Day ticket sales at the North American box office came to about $3.67 billion, according to Comscore, well short of the $4 billion-plus season that was once automatic. You could point to numerous reasons for that, like the diminished potency of superhero films or that Sony Pictures Animation\u2019s \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the biggest hit of the summer, launched on Netflix, not in theaters.",
      "But it\u2019s also true that Hollywood, mostly concerned with hitting home runs, is badly in need of some doubles, too.",
      "This year\u2019s TIFF was full of good candidates, though some of them will be steered toward streaming platforms. That includes Rian Johnson\u2019s deliciously gothic, surprisingly sincere, church-set whodunit \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,\u201d which Netflix will give a two-week theatrical release despite its director\u2019s strong affinity for theaters.",
      "And Paul Greengrass\u2019 \u201cThe Lost Bus,\u201d a disaster movie for the age of climate change, will likewise get a quick two weeks in theaters before landing on Apple TV+. Starring Matthew McConaughey as a bus driver rescuing kids during the 2018 Camp Fire, Greengrass' film viscerally captures the swift-spreading blaze, as well as the dry, tinderbox landscape it rose out of.",
      "But even a brief theatrical run can be hard-won. Nia DaCosta\u2019s \u201cHedda,\u201d a stylish 1950s-set Ibsen adaptation starring Tessa Thompson, will launch in theaters Oct. 22 before detouring to Prime Video a week later.",
      "\u201cLiterally three months after it was greenlit, people were like: This movie wouldn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d DaCosta said. \u201cWe were with Orion Pictures, a full theatrical release, and then the strikes happened. We were holding. We had to fight for the movie to stay alive. We lived but the consequence of that was theatrical window and then Prime Video. We did feel that industry shift. But I\u2019m really proud we got to make it.\u201d",

      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which Lionsgate will release Oct. 17, is a little clunky at times, but its satire of the gig economy isn\u2019t off target, nor is Keanu Reeves\u2019 performance as a sweet but mistake-prone angel. Ansari plays a man driven to homelessness whose not-official guardian angel (Reeves), overstepping his bounds, swaps his life with that of a much wealthier man (Seth Rogen).",
      "It was one of two movies at TIFF trying for a throwback kind of high-concept comedy. The other was David Freyne\u2019s \u201cEternity.\u201d It\u2019s set in a retro-designed afterlife way station where the dead select an eternity to live in.

Again, the (sort of) guardian angels in charge of guiding each soul \u2014 Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph and John Early \u2014 steal the show.",

But tastes are always changing. Donna Langley, chief of Universal Pictures, noted as much in her talk at the festival.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the shift in horror,\u201d said Langley, who pointed to \u201cauteur directors turning to horror.\u201d \"It\u2019s not the horror as we came to know over the last decade.\u201d",
      "Fate, like it does in \u201cEternity\u201d and \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d will soon have its say for this year's crop of crowd pleasers in search of ticket-buying crowds. Some signs are ominous. Last year\u2019s winner of the festival\u2019s People's Choice Award \u2014 the most watched honor of TIFF and usually a signal of a surefire best-picture nomination \u2014 went to the Stephen King adaptation \u201cThe Life of Chuck.\u201d Mike Flanagan's film didn\u2019t have distribution at the time, and when Neon ultimately released it in June, \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d went mostly unnoticed. It was a reminder that success in Toronto no longer guarantees anything.",
      "Some are taking distribution into their own hands. Black Bear Pictures, the production company behind last year\u2019s \u201cSing Sing,\u201d announced that it will distribute one of the buzziest TIFF entries: David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s \u201cChristy,\u201d starring Sydney Sweeney as the boxer Christy Martin. Black Bear co-financed \u201cChristy,\u201d just as it did two other highlights of TIFF: Clint Bentley\u2019s Denis Johnson adaptation \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d a hit at Sundance, and Daniel Roher\u2019s \u201cTuner.\u201d",
      "\u201cTuner,\u201d which played without distribution in place, stars Leo Woodall (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) as a piano tuner with a pitch-perfect ear who, after his father-figure partner (Dustin Hoffman) falls ill, uses his gift to crack open safes. It's a crackling crime thriller, and \u2014 like so many of the movies at TIFF \u2014 the kind of movie that supposedly doesn't get made anymore. And yet movies like \u201cTuner\u201d do get made, somehow, and will keep finding a way to do so, so long as audiences show up for them.",
      "\u201cSomeone wrote, \u2018This movie-movies really hard,\u2019\u201d Roher said at the premiere, citing a review. \u201cI was like: That\u2019s right. That was the intention.\u201d",

      "Julian Fellowes has been saying goodbye to \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d for nearly as long as it has existed. By the fifth season of the series, he\u2019d even grown accustomed to writing more definitive endings, not knowing that there would be a sixth season and three feature films to come.",
      "But 15 years after the world first met Violet Crawley, Lord Grantham, Lady Mary, Mr. Carson, John Bates and everyone else upstairs and downstairs at that beautiful estate, the creators are really, truly closing a chapter and saying farewell with \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale,\u201d which opens in theaters nationwide Friday.",
      "\u201cIt is sad,\u201d Fellowes said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge chunk of my life. And when I die, I think it\u2019ll probably be the only job anyone remembers. But I hope it\u2019s been happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d which was conceived by producer Gareth Neame as a kind of spinoff to \u201cGosford Park,\u201d was in many ways an improbable hit. In an era of television that celebrated difficult men and antiheroes, here was a warm British period drama about aristocrats and their household staff that became a global phenomenon and, later, a successful film franchise. The first two features, released in 2019 and 2022, grossed more than $287 million at the worldwide box office.",
      "\u201cNone of us knew it was going to be a success,\u201d said actor Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham. \u201cI remember Gareth saying to me, \u2018Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not going to run beyond seven episodes, these sorts of shows don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d",
      "But audiences never seemed to tire of the Downton crew. The longer it went on, the more it became part of the furniture.",
      "\u201cIt has been this remarkable journey,\u201d Neame said. \u201cWe look at the Grantham family, the Crawleys, as a representative of the families that we all live in because we\u2019ve seen them marry and have children and pass away and get money and lose money and become sick and get well again, hopefully. There\u2019s something extremely comforting about that.\u201d",
      "Despite the success of the show, which ended in 2015, a feature film was never a given. From a studio perspective, Neame said, there were very few precedents and the ones that existed were not positive. Money always seemed to be lost. But the bigger headache was the idea that even if they got the greenlight to make a film, they\u2019d have to assemble more than 20 specific actors to do it. And they needed every one.",
      "\u201cWe said goodbye when we finished the TV show and didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever come back,\u201d Bonneville said. \u201cI said, it\u2019s like herding cats, he\u2019ll never get us together again. And, blow me down, he did, not once but three times.\u201d",
      "They were difficult negotiations, Neame said, and much more complicated than anyone might imagine, but there was still such goodwill that they made it work. Especially for this last film, he said, \u201ceveryone wanted to give it a proper conclusion and see an ending for all of those characters.\u201d",
      "In the first film, the family prepared for a visit from the king and the queen. In the second, they traveled to the South of France and said goodbye to the Dowager, Maggie Smith's sharp, beloved matriarch who had been with the show from the beginning and was a large part of the reason it even got made. There were many farewell parties for her on set. Then, two years after the film was released, Smith died at 89.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Why would anyone keep a prop from the set of \u201cJaws?\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg was musing about what it felt like while making his 1975 oceanic classic, and how little he thought any of it would matter when shooting the now-legendary opening scene of a woman night-swimming past an ocean buoy. His primary concern was keeping his job as a 26-year-old director amid unfolding disasters.",

      "That prop is among the first things visitors will see as they enter a 50th anniversary \u201cJaws\u201d exhibit opening Sunday and running through July at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.",
      "The exhibition featuring more than 200 pieces from the culture-changing blockbuster is the first full show in the four-year history of the museum that is dedicated to a single film. It comes amid a bevy of celebrations of the film's five-decade life, including a theatrical re-release last week.",
      "Spielberg spoke to a gathering of media at the museum after touring the exhibit, which takes visitors chronologically through the film's three acts, with some relic or recreation from virtually every scene.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of the work they\u2019ve done,\u201d the 78-year-old said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve put together here at this exhibition is just awesome. Every room has the minutiae of how this picture got together.\u201d",
      "\u201cClearly this is a very historic initiative for us,\u201d museum director Amy Homma said before introducing the director and also announced the museum plans a full Spielberg retrospective in 2028.",

      "A new Whitney Houston song has arrived 13 years after her death",
      "NEW YORK -- It sounds impossible, but that's the magic of it. On Thursday, a new Whitney Houston song arrives 13 years after her death.",
      "English singer Calum Scott is responsible. The single is a duet between Scott and Houston, a balladic reinterpretation of the timeless \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\u201d using Houston's original vocal stems. (Stems are the individual musical elements that, when combined, make up a song.)",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I could have dreamt as a possibility, and the fact that I'm getting to do it is, geez, one of the honors of my career,\u201d Scott told The Associated Press. Houston's voice is one that soundtracked his childhood \u2014 courtesy his mom \u2014 and he refers to Houston as one of the most influential performers in his life and the lives of many.",
      "\u201cTimeless,\u201d he describes her.",
      "Here's how the new song came into existence.",
      "Such an undertaking couldn't be possible without the approval of a number of parties. Specifically, it required Pat Houston, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the executor of her estate, and Primary Wave, which acquired the copyrights to hit Whitney Houston songs as part of a 2022 deal.",
      "Pat Houston says the idea for Scott's \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d actually came from Primary Wave. They were familiar with Scott's live cover version of the song from his stint opening for Ed Sheeran in 2024. On that tour, Scott stripped the 1987 classic down into a ballad, blending it with Robyn's \u201cDancing On My Own.\u201d",
      "After hearing what Scott could do with the song \u2014 taking it from its up-tempo pop spirit to a big-hearted ballad, while also taking into consideration that 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Houston's music career \u2014 Pat Houston was on board. It was yet another opportunity for celebration. \u201cI said, you know what, this is a no-brainer. This is the Houston style. So, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhitney was a balladeer and that\u2019s why we all fell in love with her,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Calum turned the song into a beautiful ballad.\u201d",
      "First, the Houston estate and Primary Wave provided Scott with the original vocal stems, produced by her longtime producer Narada Michael Walden. Then Scott recorded the song with producers Jon \u201cMAGS\u201d Maguire, Andrew Yeates and Charlie T in the U.K. in \u201cabout a week,\u201d he recalls. They were joined by a string section, which gave additional dimension to their somber take on the song.",
      "\u201cTake a pop song and make it sad,\u201d Scott jokes of his approach.",
      "Recording the ballad made sense because, as Scott points out, the lyrics to the original song are a bit melancholic. \u201cYou want to dance with somebody who loved you, you know, you're not actually dancing with them,\u201d he says. It's about yearning. But in an early demo, the chorus was recorded in a minor chord \u2014 which sounded a bit too depressing. The change was made swiftly; even slowed, the song needed some of that Houston ebullience.",

      "Another early decision: The new song would start with just Houston's voice, alone, in the first verse. \u201cWhitney starts the song because this is her song,\u201d Scott says simply. \u201cI would never dare stand in front of Whitney for that first verse.\u201d",
      "Eagle-eyed (eared?) fans might notice the sound of a snare drum bleeding into her vocal on that verse \u2014 because it was originally recorded to tape, not digitally, and because \u201cwe can\u2019t change anything like that because those are etched into the song and into her vocal,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd to remove it would be taking a piece away.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons they kept the song's iconic key change in the last chorus as well.",
      "\u201cI really had to dig for those high notes,\u201d he says of the recording. \u201cIt was an honor just to harmonize with her.\u201d",
      "Scott looked to the original songwriters for approval \u2014 the dream team of George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam. They were immediately on board.",
      "\u201cSome people would have come in and they would have added something ... to boost their visibility next to Whitney. And he had the boldness to tear it all down and just have acoustic piano, just Whitney, and then give her the first verse,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cAnd I mean, this is his project. To me, that\u2019s showing such respect.\u201d",
      "That, and they recognize Scott as a virtuosic vocalist. \u201cHis music really features his voice, as with Adele or Whitney, and rightly so because he can carry it off,\u201d said Rubicam. \u201cThere aren\u2019t just hundreds of people who can carry that off with his kind of power.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a good vocal match together,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey both got a lot of emotionality and command also of their vocal instrument. ... Whitney could overpower a lot of people. But for Calum, he\u2019s confident and he had a vision about it and they both are meeting at an emotional level.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I gently walked alongside Whitney,\u201d says Scott. The song is meant to feel alive, channeling the spirit of Houston \u2014 not a tribute, but an active single. It's why their version of \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d will be featured on his new album \u201cAvenoir,\u201d out Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cThis is as much part of my story as any other song on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cJust being given the honor of it has been, you know, I could die a very happy man now.\u201d",
      "\u201cForty years ago, this particular song was hot then and it\u2019s hot now,\u201d says Pat Houston. \u201cSo why not keep producing. But it\u2019s the right connection, it's the right platform and it certainly is the right artist to collab with her on this.\u201d",

      "\"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale\" brings change to the Crawley family as they face the 1930s",
      "Change comes slowly to the Downton Abbey universe and its Crawley family. Just watch Robert Crawley go flat-hunting in London.",
      "Wait, what? FLAT-HUNTING? The Earl of Grantham? Well, yes, and it\u2019s the most amusing scene in \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d (a self-announcing title if there ever was one).",
      "Just look at proud and starched Robert (Hugh Bonneville), trying to be open-minded but utterly flummoxed by this \u201cflat\u201d in which you cannot go \u201cup\u201d to bed because there is no \u201cup.\u201d Well, you can go \u201calong\u201d to bed, suggests daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery, as always the sensible center of things) trying to make it all sound manageable.",
      "But the prospect of flat-living \u2014 rather than maintaining a mansion in London \u2014 is a thing the Crawleys must consider as they move into the 1930s, with financial and social instability always around the corner. \u201cFamilies like us need to keep moving to survive,\u201d says Mary, with the weight of Downton Abbey\u2019s future itself resting on her shoulders.",
      "A note to those coming in cold to the franchise here: Well, it\u2019s going to be quite hard. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis do not engage in hand-holding when it comes to mastering the Crawley family tree or the broader family of servants that Downton fans know and love. Even those who saw the first two films \u2013 the last in 2022 \u2013 might feel the need for a refresher.",
      "We begin in London\u2019s West End, at a show by Noel Coward, attended by Downton inhabitants from all levels. They\u2019re all there to watch dashing actor Guy Dexter (Dominic West), who in the last movie asked former butler Thomas Barrow to become his dresser, and more. It\u2019s nice to see Barrow is happy now, able to live life as a gay man \u2014 even if Robert can\u2019t quite grasp their relationship (change is slow, remember).",
      "Meanwhile Mary is shopping in London with sister Edith, and the importance of this scene is perhaps to remind us that the real star of the \u201cDownton\u201d universe, after that stupendous house of course, are the costumes. Mary finds a sleek red satin gown that is quite possibly the most smashing outfit we\u2019ve seen yet.",
      "But when she puts it on for a society ball, trouble erupts. As the family arrives we learn that Mary\u2019s divorce decree has come through \u2014 and this means, alas, that she will become a pariah. The newspaper screams news of \u201cdivorce in high places,\u201d and indeed, the ball\u2019s hostess actually kicks Mary out of the party because royalty is coming. Mary\u2019s concerned parents are outraged \u2014 but they stay, and their daughter heads out, quipping that she hopes a taxi will agree to take her.",
      "Soon enough we\u2019re back at Downton, and there is one very big difference: no longer does Violet Crawley, aka Maggie Smith, with her inimitable style and those hilarious quips, rule the halls. She died in the last film \u2014 and Smith died in 2024. But the film is dedicated to her in more ways than one.",

The playwright is the closest thing in Downton world to a modern celebrity \u2014 everyone wants to be with him, no matter station nor gender, and he winds up helping Mary overcome her social shunning.",
      "Nowhere to be seen is dashing Hugh Dancy, who played a film director (besotted with Mary) in the last movie. But the character that director anointed as a screenwriter, Joseph Moseley (Kevin Doyle), is back, and Fellowes must have enjoyed writing this line for him: \u201cIn many ways the writers are the stars of cinema.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Polly Holliday, a Tony Award-nominated screen and stage actor who turned the catchphrase \u201cKiss my grits!\u201d into a national retort as the gum-chewing, beehive-wearing waitress aboard the long-running CBS sitcom \u201cAlice,\u201d has died. She was 88.",
      "Holliday died Tuesday at her home in New York, said her theatrical agent, Dennis Aspland. She was the last surviving member of the principal cast of \u201cAlice;\u201d Linda Lavin, who played the title character, died last year.",
      "\u201cAlice\u201d ran from 1976 to 1985, but Holliday had turned into such a star that the network gave her her own short-lived spin-off called \u201cFlo\u201d in 1980. It lasted a year.",
      "Holliday earned four Golden Globe nominations and won one in 1980 for \u201cAlice,\u201d as well as four Emmy Award nominations, three for \u201cAlice\u201d and one for \u201cFlo.\u201d",
      "As for the \u201cKiss my grits!\u201d line, the Alabama-born Holliday was quick to distance herself from it, telling interviewers that the line was \u201cpure Hollywood\u201d and not a regional saying. But she identified with Flo.",

      "Sheen grew up on film sets and began creating home movies as a young child, before getting his big break starring in movies like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cWall Street.\u201d His decorated career in Hollywood, however, was accompanied by decades of drug abuse, legal battles, an HIV diagnosis and messy divorces.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a good guy,\u201d Sheen said. \u201cGood guys sometimes do some bad things but the only way to stay a good guy is to own that (expletive) and move forward.\u201d",

There\u2019s no animus against any other person in the book, even yourself, which I really appreciate. Not just your gentleness with other people, but your gentleness with yourself.\u201d",
      "The book chronicles Sheen's life from a near-death experience during his birth in 1965 to the moment he decided to get sober in 2017. It carries a unique writing style, with certain words purposefully misspelled and instead written the way Sheen sees them in his mind, he said. Dude, for instance, became \u201cdood.\"",

      "Curator Madeleine Haddon said the never-made film \u2014 titled \u201cYoung Americans,\u201d like Bowie\u2019s 1975 album of the same name \u2014 is \u201creflective on what it\u2019s like to be a Brit in the U.S., and thinking about international politics and their place in the world.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s about \u201cthe relationship between art and politics in London at the cusp of modernity,\u201d Haddon said Wednesday at a preview of V&A's David Bowie Centre. \u201cI would love to see where he was going with that.\u201d",
      "The center, which opens Saturday, is a treasure chest for Bowie fans and researchers, holding everything from stage outfits and musical instruments \u2013 a stringed Japanese koto, Ziggy Stardust\u2019s acoustic guitar \u2013 to letters, lyrics, photos, to-do lists and idea-filled sticky notes.",
      "The archive chronicles decades of restless creativity by the shape-shifting musician, who was born plain old David Jones in the London suburbs in 1947.",
      "Bowie donned and shed personas as he moved through musical styles, from glam rock to soul, electronica and collaborations with British jungle and drum \u2018n\u2019 bass musicians, including A Guy Called Gerald and Goldie. He also acted in movies and on Broadway, collaborated on stage shows, painted and embraced technology, setting up a 1990s internet service provider called BowieNet.",
      "\u201cHe was such a world-builder,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cMusic was (just) one angle into the worlds he wanted to build.\u201d",
      "The archive occupies part of the V&A East Storehouse, a hybrid warehouse-museum that opened in June in east London\u2019s Olympic Park.

      "From a record-breaking standing ovation to the ever-present Campari spritzes to even on-screen subtitles, the 2025 Venice Film Festival was a bounty of interesting numbers",
      "VENICE, Italy -- After 10 days and dozens of red carpet premieres, the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival came to a close Saturday. While cinema is focused on the qualitative, a quantitative look can tell a story of its own. There are, after all, plenty of fascinating figures \u2014 beyond the celebrity kind \u2014 to be found on the Lido.",
      "Here's a look at this year's Venice Film Festival, by the numbers.",
      "That figure includes 1,936 feature films, which cost 200 euros ($234) apiece to submit. To be eligible for selection, a film must have been completed after Sept. 7, 2024, and must be making its world premiere at Venice. The festival decides what section a selected film goes in.",
      "It amounts to slightly over 1% of the feature films submitted. The 21 movies were the ones eligible for awards like the Golden Lion, which was won this year by Jim Jarmusch's \u201cFather Mother Sister Bother.\u201d There were also 30 films making their world premieres at Venice, but out of competition, like Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Nineteen films played in the Horizons (Orizzonti) sidebar, which has its own awards. The Venice Classics sidebar featured 18 restorations.",
      "Led by American director Alexander Payne, the jury included French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof (he lives in exile in Germany), Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres and Chinese actor Zhao Tao. They decide the winners among the main competition.",
      "The applause meter at film festivals is notoriously faulty, calibrated differently outlet by outlet, but it was clear that the ovation for \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d was record-breaking and definitely over 20 minutes. Variety reported 22 and BBC had it at 23. Kaouther Ben Hania's movie easily surpassed last year's Golden Lion winner, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which had people on their feet for 18 minutes.",
      "Doing the math, that's definitely more than 82 years ago. The festival has been suspended or periodically taken different forms over the years, including during World War II \u2014 though it did go forward in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Selections hailed from far and wide, from the U.S., France and, of course, Italy, to Ecuador, Slovakia and Taipei.",
      "There's space for short films \u2014 20 minutes and under \u2014 and feature films \u2014 longer than 60 minutes \u2014 but woe betide the filmmaker who makes anything in between.",
      "That distinction belongs to Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, in which Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin.",
      "The longest ovation went to the shortest film in competition, \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d Ben Hania's film combines real audio from Hind Rajab, the Palestinian 6-year-old girl who was found dead days after her desperate call for rescue in Gaza, with actors portraying volunteers at the Red Crescent, where the movie is set.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza reverberated through the festival, with high-profile calls to disinvite Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot over the war and questions to filmmakers and actors about an indie film company\u2019s funding ties to the Israeli military. The Aug. 30 march in Venice aimed to turn the spotlight from the stars to the war, and organizers estimate that over 10,000 people turned out.",
      "Those Golden Lions went to Kim Novak, the 92-year-old legendary actor who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's \u201cVertigo,\u201d and Werner Herzog, the prolific 83-year-old German filmmaker whose works range from lauded documentaries like \u201cLittle Dieter Needs to Fly\u201d to the Nicolas Cage-starrer \u201cBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\u201d (He also acts, as viewers of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d can attest.)",

      "It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo with poor road networks, which is more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the nation\u2019s capital of Kinshasa.",
      "A United Nations peacekeeping helicopter was used to help deliver 400 vaccine doses to the epicenter, in the locality of Bulape, on Friday, Patrick Otim, WHO's programme area manager, told a briefing in Geneva.",
      "An additional 1,500 doses will be sent from the capital of Kinshasa, he said.",
      "\u201cWe have struggled in the last seven days with access but are collaborating with MONUSCO (UN peacekeeping mission in Congo) now,\u201d Otim said.",
      "While the WHO and Congolese authorities have \u201cramped up efforts to have a full scale response\u201d on ground, \u201cwe need to be able to pay for the operations,\u201d he added.",

      "Otim said the most recent confirmed case was located 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the current epicenter. \u201cOur worry is if we get cases in the other health zone, we need to expand and it will be resource-intensive,\u201d he said.",

      "A new study finds well-preserved areas of Amazon rainforest occupied and managed by Indigenous peoples show lower incidences of multiple diseases in the regions around them",
      "Every time humans cut into the Amazon rainforest or burn or destroy parts of it, they're making people sick.",
      "It's an idea Indigenous people have lived by for thousands of years. Now a new study in the journal Communications Earth & Environment adds to the scientific evidence supporting it, by finding that instances of several diseases were lowered in areas where forest was set aside for Indigenous peoples who maintained it well.",
      "With the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil in November, the study authors and outside experts said the work highlights the stakes for people around the world as negotiators try to address climate change. Belem, the city hosting the conference, is known as the gateway to the Amazon, and many who will be attending, from activists to delegates, think the role of Indigenous communities in climate action and conservation will be highlighted in a distinct way.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018forest man\u2019 or \u2018man forest,\u2019 according to the Indigenous perspective, has always been linked to the reciprocity between human health and the natural environment where one lives,\u201d said Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Cayetano, president of the Federation of Ticuna and Yagua Communities of the Lower Amazon, or FECOTYBA, in the Peruvian Amazon. \u201cIf each state does not guarantee the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, we would inevitably be harming their health, their lives, and the ecosystem itself.\u201d",
      "That harm can look like respiratory diseases such as asthma caused by toxic air pollution after fires, or illnesses that spread from animals to humans such as malaria, said Paula Prist, a senior program coordinator for the Forest and Grasslands Unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and one of the study authors.",
      "The researchers compiled and analyzed data on forest quality, legal recognition of Indigenous territory and disease incidence in the countries that border and include the Amazon.",
      "The work was \u201cimpressive\u201d to University of Washington health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi. She said it highlighted the complexity of factors that affect human health, and the importance of understanding the role Indigenous communities play in shaping it. \u201cUsing these methods, others could study other parts of the world,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found creative ways to account for other variables that can affect the spread of diseases, like access to health care in a given area, said Magdalena Hurtado, an anthropology and global health professor at Arizona State University and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who was not involved with the study. But she expressed concern that the findings were presented with a precision that may not be warranted, given that they were based on correlation and use data on observations that can be difficult to measure.",
      "\u201cThey claim that Indigenous territories only protect health when forest cover is above 40%. And so that that feels like, why 40%? Why not 35? Or why not a range?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the study is wrong, but it means that we need to be cautious because the patterns could change if different, more precise methods were used.\u201d",
      "Still, she thinks this is a starting point that could open the door to future research. \u201cThey are actually doing something quite beautiful,\u201d empirically connecting the legal recognition of Indigenous lands to human health outcomes, she said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, of FECOTYBA, said that's important for the global policymakers who are coming to Brazil.",
      "\u201cFrom my Indigenous perspective, I think that this type of study would make our ancestral knowledge more visible and precise,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is willing to risk a government shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accept Democratic demands on health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he\u2019s now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accede to Democratic demands.",
      "Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn\u2019t include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don\u2019t negotiate a bipartisan deal.",
      "\u201cThings have changed\u201d since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump\u2019s massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified \u2014 unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against legislation to fund the government.",
      "A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn\u2019t necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. \u201cIt will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can\u2019t negotiate a deal \u2014 vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan.",
      "It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.",
      "Republicans have said that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don\u2019t vote to keep the government open, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to come to them with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year.",

      "Schumer said Democrats also want Republicans to commit that the White House won\u2019t take back money they have negotiated and Congress has approved after Republicans pushed through a $9 billion cut requested by the White House in July and Trump blocked the additional foreign aid money in August. \u201cHow do you pass an appropriations bill and let them undo it down the road?\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer\u2019s vote that House Democrats \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the plan.",
      "This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats\u2019 closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown.",
      "\u201cI did what I thought was right\u201d in March, Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different situation now than then.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to subpoena medical records of transgender patients who received gender-affirming care at Boston Children's Hospital.",
      "In a ruling on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Myong Joun said the administrative subpoena served by the U.S. Department of Justice was improper and \u201cmotivated only by bad faith.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department said the information was needed to investigate possible fraud or unlawful off-label promotion of drugs, but the information requested \u2014 including actual patient records \u2014 seemed to be unrelated, the judge said. Phone messages left with the Justice Department\u2019s attorney Ross Goldstein and with a Justice Department public affairs officer were not immediately returned.",
      "\u201cThe Administration has been explicit about its disapproval of the transgender community and its aim to end GAC,\u201d Joun wrote, referring to gender-affirming care. The judge later continued, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the true purpose of issuing the subpoena is to interfere with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' right to protect GAC within its borders, to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.\u201d",
      "Just eight days after taking office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at restricting access to medical care for transgender youth. In June, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division announced the division would use \u201call available resources to prioritize investigations of doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other appropriate entities,\u201d in an effort to investigate what it called \u201cradical gender experimentation.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in a statement July 9 that the Justice Department had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender patients under 18. Bondi said the requests were part of investigations into \u201chealthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d But the requests did not just seek information on policies or billing practices \u2014 they also demanded information about individual patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "Boston Children's Hospital asked the federal court to quash the subpoena on July 8, saying the Justice Department was seeking practically every document related to the provision of gender-affirming care over the past five and a half years, including highly sensitive and personally identifiable information about young patients.",
      "But the Justice Department contended the subpoena was proper and a valid way for the agency to investigate potential violations of off-label prescription drug rules.",

      "Israel's tactical gains have meanwhile come at an enormous cost to Palestinian civilians, with tens of thousands killed, vast areas destroyed and famine in Gaza City. They have also left Israel more isolated than ever on the world stage, and the strike on Qatar has deepened the sense, even among friendly Arab countries, that Israel has become a regional menace.",
      "That isolation likely brings some solace to Hamas\u2019 embattled members inside Gaza, where the government it has run since seizing power in 2007 has mostly collapsed and its security forces have melted away.",
      "Israel says it now controls 75% of the territory, much of which has been reduced to fields of rubble, and has vowed to take the rest. Hamas is largely confined to the same enclaves where much of Gaza's population of some 2 million Palestinians have sought refuge.",

      "MULANJE, Malawi -- Alex Maere survived the destruction of Cyclone Freddy when it tore through southern Malawi in 2023. His farm didn't.",
      "The 59-year-old saw decades of work disappear with the precious soil that the floods stripped from his small-scale farm in the foothills of Mount Mulanje.",
      "He was used to producing a healthy 850 kilograms (1,870 pounds) of corn each season to support his three daughters and two sons. He salvaged just 8 kilograms (17 pounds) from the wreckage of Freddy.",
      "\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he said, remembering how his farm in the village of Sazola became a wasteland of sand and rocks.",
      "Freddy jolted Maere into action. He decided he needed to change his age-old tactics if he was to survive.",
      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",
      "Artificial intelligence has the potential to uplift agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 33-50 million smallholder farms like Maere's produce up to 70-80% of the food supply, according to the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development. Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "But to work in Malawi, AI still needs a human touch. For Maere's area, that is the job of 33-year-old Patrick Napanja, a farmer support agent who brings a smartphone with the app for those who have no devices. Chongo calls him the \u201chuman in the loop.\"",
      "\u201cI used to struggle to provide answers to some farming challenges, now I use the app,\" said Napanja.",
      "Farmer support agents like Napanja generally have around 150-200 farmers to help and try to visit them in village groups once a week. But sometimes, most of an hour-long meeting is taken up waiting for responses to load because of the area's poor connectivity, he said. Other times, they have to trudge up nearby hills to get a signal.",

      "But he said Malawi faces challenges in getting the tool to enough communities to make an extensive difference. Those communities don't just need smartphones, but also to be able to afford internet access.",
      "For Malawi, the potential may be in combining AI with traditional collaboration among communities.",
      "\u201cFarmers who have access to the app are helping fellow farmers,\u201d Jassi said, and that is improving productivity.",

      "For over three years, Ukraine has been battling Russian attack drones",
      "LONDON -- For more than three years, Ukraine has waged an almost nightly battle against Russian attack drones. NATO on Wednesday got a taste of that fight.",
      "Polish authorities said they detected 19 violations of their airspace, prompting a million-dollar response as fighter jets were scrambled and Patriot air defense systems placed on alert. Up to four drones were shot down with the help of NATO allies.",
      "The incursion, which lasted for several hours, showed NATO's vulnerability to drone warfare. Russian authorities said they didn\u2019t target Poland, and Belarus, a close ally, said some of the drones \u201clost their course\u201d because they were jammed. Nonetheless, several European leaders and experts said Poland was deliberately targeted.",
      "If one or two drones crossed into Polish airspace, it could have been a \u201ctechnical malfunction,\u201d but it \u201cdefies imagination that it could have been accidental\u201d when there were 19, said Poland's Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski.",
      "While proving intent is difficult, \"to have several to lose their way is starting to look rather deliberate,\u201d agreed Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "A goal, he suggested, could have been to test NATO's reaction and ability to respond to drones.",
      "Since January, Russia has fired at least 35,698 attack drones at Ukraine according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Ukrainian air force.",
      "Polish airspace has been violated multiple times since the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Fragments from Ukrainian missiles killed two people in Poland in 2023, while drones have strayed into Poland, Romana and Moldova as well as the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.",
      "But until Wednesday, no NATO country had sustained multiple incursions into its airspace. It was the first time NATO airpower was engaged against enemy targets inside a NATO country.",
      "Drone fragments were found about 554 kilometers (344 miles) into Polish territory \u2014 deeper than any previous incursion.",
      "Much remains unclear, and for now, NATO is cautious. \u201cWe do not yet know if this was an intentional act or an unintentional act,\u201d U.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander Europe, said Thursday.",
      "He went on: \u201cI would not be able to tell you with any confidence today that it was 20 (drones) or that it was 10. We just have to get into the technical details to figure that out, to debrief the crews that were up, see what they saw, et cetera.\u201d",
      "It's difficult \"without hard evidence,\u201d to say if Moscow really intended to fly the drones into Poland, said Ash Alexander-Cooper, a former specialist military commander and vice president at Dedrone, which produces technology to detect and neutralize drone threats.",
      "But, based on what is known about Russian drones and how they respond to electronic warfare, the experts who spoke to AP said it was highly possible the incursions were deliberate.",
      "There are two key ways to neutralize most drones: either shoot them down, or hit them with electronic signals interference.",
      "Jamming and spoofing are the main ways to do that. Jamming severs the connection the drone has with a satellite navigation system, whereas spoofing tricks the drone into thinking it is somewhere else.",
      "If the drone were jammed \u2014 either by Ukraine or Poland \u2014 it would either land or fly back toward its point of origin in Russia or Belarus, said Withington.",
      "If it were spoofed, it could fly off course, crash or land.",
      "If the drone were spoofed, trying to jam it could actually \u201cmake the problem worse,\u201d said Alexander-Cooper. Jamming a drone normally sends it home, but Russia is now programming some drones so that their \u201chome\u201d is actually their target. If satellite communications are cut, the drones continue toward their targets.",
      "Military drones also have inertial navigation units, which use previous position fixes and gyroscopes to mark the drone\u2019s position relative to the earth so that it can keep flying without satellite or radio signals.",
      "In that case, the drones could only have penetrated deep into Polish airspace if Russia had given them a targeted \u201cmission,\" said Withington.",

      "The response, Alexander-Cooper suggested, was economically disproportionate to the threat.",
      "\u201cFiring million-dollar missiles ... is not an economical model that can be sustained\" against drones that cost tens of thousands of dollars, he said.",

It would also require putting fighter jet pilots \u2014 who are in limited supply and expensive to train \u2014 in harm's way, he said.",
      "Both Russia and Ukraine have rapidly developed new drones, technology and tactics.",

      "After Wednesday's incursion, Polish authorities said drone fragments were found at 16 locations. This could indicate that several drones escaped.",
      "The fact that some of the drones were able to fly so far into Polish airspace is an indication that \u201cperhaps somewhere the detection capability was lacking,\u201d said Withington.",
      "Current NATO air defenses are largely set up to detect and neutralize fast-moving targets like cruise and ballistic missiles, said Withington. They are not, he said, designed to track small objects, often made from fiberglass or plastic, which don\u2019t reflect radar waves in the same way as a metal missile.",
      "Sikorski said Wednesday Poland needed a drone wall and \u201cnew techniques\u201d to repel a mass attack.",

But that\u2019s only possible for countries that are obeying the EU\u2019s rules on limiting debt or are moving to comply, which France at this point is not.",
      "Lagarde said the ECB's emergency bond market backstop, dubbed the transmission protection instrument, was not discussed at the meeting and that the broader European bond market was functioning normally.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not commenting on any particular country, but suffice to say that we always monitor market developments and euro area sovereign bonds are orderly and are functioning smoothly with good liquidity,\u201d she said.",
      "Analysts say the challenge for Lagarde is to avoid suggesting the ECB would bail out politicians who won\u2019t manage the government\u2019s finances properly, while not taking such a hard line that she unsettles bond markets.",

      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- Two days of deadly violence left the streets of Kathmandu resembling a war zone. Nepal\u2019s major symbols of power like Parliament, the Supreme Court, and the president\u2019s house were burned by angry protesters. The prime minister was forced to quit, and no one seemed to be in control.",

      "Five days after the violence began, Nepalis are still wondering who is in charge of the country where 34 people were killed in protests sparked by a short-lived social media ban and fueled by broader discontent against the government. But with the army stepping up, many people are breathing a sigh of relief, in contrast to some other countries where citizens are usually fearful of the military taking over the civilian government in moments of crisis.",

      "The military in Nepal, which has also fought a bloody Maoist rebellion, is rarely mobilized in the Himalayan nation wedged between China and India. It is also not known for battling enemy troops at the border and has mostly been confined to barracks. It is normally sought out only when there are floods, landslides or rescues during earthquakes.",

      "This week\u2019s deadly protests, however, could very well be the greatest challenge it has faced so far.",
      "So far, the military has been successful in bringing calm, quelling a jailbreak in the heart of the capital, Kathmandu, and initiating talks with the protesters on naming a transitional leader. On Friday, Nepal\u2019s president, army officials and representatives from various protesting groups held meetings to decide on a name.",

      "South Korea\u2019s president says that South Korean companies will likely hesitate to maintain or make direct investments in the United States if the U.S. fails to improve its visa system for Korean workers",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s president said Thursday that South Korean companies will likely hesitate to maintain or make direct investments in the United States if the U.S. fails to improve its visa system for Korean workers.",
      "In a news conference marking 100 days in office, Lee called for improvements in the U.S. visa system as he spoke about the Sept. 4 immigration raid in Georgia that resulted in the arrest of more than 300 South Korean workers at a battery factory under construction at Hyundai\u2019s sprawling auto plant in Georgia.",
      "Lee said the Korean workers are set to be brought home on Friday aboard a charter plane following negotiations with the U.S.",
      "The massive roundup in Georgia, and U.S. authorities\u2019 release of video showing some workers being chained and taken away, sparked widespread anger and a sense of betrayal in South Korea. The raid came less than two weeks after a summit between President Donald Trump and Lee, and just weeks after the countries reached a July agreement that spared South Korea from the Trump administration\u2019s highest tariffs, but only after Seoul pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investments.",
      "Lawmakers from both Lee\u2019s liberal Democratic Party and the conservative opposition decried the detentions as outrageous and heavy-handed, while South Korea\u2019s biggest newspaper compared the raid to a \u201crabbit hunt\u201d executed by U.S. immigration authorities in a zeal to meet an alleged White House goal of 3,000 arrests a day.",
      "During the news conference, Lee said South Korean and U.S. officials are discussing a possible improvement to the U.S. visa system, adding that under the current system South Korean companies \u201ccan\u2019t help hesitating a lot\u201d about making direct investments in the U.S.",
      "U.S. authorities said some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others entered legally but had expired visas or entered on visa waivers that prohibited them from working.",
      "But South Korean experts and officials said Washington has yet to act on Seoul\u2019s yearslong demand to ensure a visa system to accommodate skilled Korean workers, though it has been pressing South Korea to expand industrial investments in the U.S.",
      "South Korean companies have been relying on short-term visitor visas or Electronic System for Travel Authorization to send workers who are needed to launch manufacturing sites and handle other setup tasks, a practice that had been largely tolerated for years.",
      "Lee said that whether the U.S. establishes a visa system allowing South Korean companies to send skilled workers to industrial sites will have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on future South Korean investments in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like these are long-term workers. When you build a facility or install equipment at a plant, you need technicians, but the United States doesn\u2019t have that workforce and yet they won\u2019t issue visas to let our people stay and do the work,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIf that\u2019s not possible, then establishing a local facility in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies. They will wonder whether they should even do it,\" Lee added.",
      "Lee said the raid showed a \u201ccultural difference\u201d between the two countries in how they handle immigration issues.",
      "\u201cIn South Korea, we see Americans coming on tourist visas to teach English at private cram schools \u2014 they do it all the time, and we don\u2019t think much of it, it\u2019s just something you accept,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cBut the United States clearly doesn\u2019t see things that way. On top of that, U.S. immigration authorities pledge to strictly forbid illegal immigration and employment and carry out deportations in various aggressive ways, and our people happened to be caught in one of those cases,\u201d he added.",
      "Following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Wednesday that U.S. officials have agreed to allow the workers detained in Georgia to later return to finish their work at the site. He added that the countries agreed to set up a joint working group for discussions on creating a new visa category to make it easier for South Korean companies to send their staff to work in the United States.",
      "Before leaving for the U.S. on Monday, Cho told lawmakers that more South Korean workers in the U.S. could be vulnerable to future crackdowns if the visa issue isn\u2019t resolved, but said Seoul does not yet have an estimate of how many might be at risk.",
      "The Georgia battery plant is one of more than 20 major industrial sites that South Korean companies are currently building in the United States. They include other battery factories in Georgia and several other states, a semiconductor plant in Texas, and a shipbuilding project in Philadelphia, a sector Trump has frequently highlighted in relation to South Korea.",
      "Min Jeonghun, a professor at South Korea\u2019s National Diplomatic Academy, said it\u2019s chiefly up to the United States to resolve the issue, either through legislation or by taking administrative steps to expand short-term work visas for training purposes.",
      "He said it would be a mistake to underestimate the public anger in South Korea over the detentions in Georgia, which came after Lee\u2019s government pledged to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. industrial investments against the backdrop of a decaying job market at home.",
      "Without an update in U.S. visa policies, Min said, \u201cKorean companies will no longer be able to send their workers to the United States, causing inevitable delays in the expansion of facilities and other production activities, and the harm will boomerang back to the U.S. economy.\"",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to boost U.S. manufacturing by attracting foreign investment are clashing with his immigration crackdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s push to revitalize American manufacturing by luring foreign investment into the U.S. has run smack into one of his other priorities: cracking down on illegal immigration.",
      "Hardly a week after immigration authorities raided a sprawling Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained more than 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country's other companies may be reluctant to take up Trump\u2019s invitation to pour money into the United States.",
      "If the U.S. can't promptly issue visas to the technicians and other skilled workers needed to launch plants, then \u201cestablishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,\u201d Lee said Thursday. \u201cThey will wonder whether they should even do it.\u201d",
      "The raid and subsequent diplomatic crisis show how the Trump administration's mass deportation goals are running up against its efforts to bring in money from abroad to drive the U.S. economy and create more jobs. Moves like workplace immigration enforcement and visa restrictions could risk alienating allies that are pledging to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. to avoid high tariffs.",
      "Trump\u2019s economic agenda is built around using hefty tariffs on imports, including a 15% levy on South Korean products, as a cudgel to force manufacturing to return to the U.S. He\u2019s repeatedly said foreign companies can escape his tariffs if they produce in America. South Korea, already a top investor, pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S. when the two sides announced a trade deal in July.",
      "It made more investments in new construction, such as factories, on previously undeveloped land than any other country in 2022. Last year, it ranked 12th in the world with $93 billion in total American investment \u2014 including acquisitions of existing companies, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",
      "But the dramatic roundup of South Koreans and others working to set up the battery plant threatens to put a chill on the investment push. Indeed, Trump seems to be trying to undo the damage.",
      "While demanding that foreign investors \u201cLEGALLY bring your very smart people,\u201d Trump also promised to \u201cmake it quickly and legally possible for you to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump will continue delivering on his promise to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws,\u201d White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement Thursday.",
      "For now, the South Koreans are furious and immigration experts are puzzled. It's been common practice for decades for foreign companies \u2014 such as the Japanese and German carmakers that have built factories in the American Midwest and South \u2014 to send technical specialists from their home countries to help open plants in the United States. Most of them train U.S. workers, then go home.",
      "\u201cJapanese managers, senior engineers, other technical experts had to come to the United States to set this stuff up,\u201d said Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University who's studied Japanese auto plants in the U.S.",

      "Stocks have hit records in large part because Wall Street is expecting the economy to pull off a delicate balancing act: slowing enough  to convince the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but not so much that it causes a recession, all while inflation remains under control.",

      "WASHINGTON -- In another grim sign for the U.S. labor market, jobless claim applications jumped to their highest level in almost four years last week, virtually assuring the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next week.",
      "The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the week ending Sept. 6 rose by 27,000 to 263,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That\u2019s the most applications since the week of Oct. 23, 2021 and well above the 231,000 new applications economists forecast. It's also the biggest week-to-week increase in almost a year.",
      "Most analysts were already forecasting an interest rate cut after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled as much at a conference of central bankers three weeks ago. However, another report Thursday showing that consumer inflation remains elevated could complicate the Fed's dual mandate of keeping prices in check while supporting a healthy labor market.",
      "Typically the Fed would cut its key rate when unemployment rose in an attempt to spur more spending and growth. But it would do the opposite and raise rates \u2014 or keep them unchanged \u2014 in the face of rising inflation.",
      "\u201cThe hot inflation print will not likely change the Fed\u2019s plan to cut rates in September, but it\u2019s possible the Fed will hold in October if inflation expectations no longer look well-contained,\u201d said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial.",
      "Fed officials recently have expressed greater concern about the deteriorating labor market than inflation, and while a rate cut could spur economic growth and boost the job market, economists fear it could push inflation even farther above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.",
      "Earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a massive preliminary revision of U.S. job gains for the 12 months ending in March, further evidence that the labor market has not been as strong as previously thought.",
      "The BLS\u2019s revised figures showed that U.S. employers added 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year ending in March 2025, with the biggest weakness coming from the leisure and hospitality sector, professional and business services and retail. The report showed that job gains were tapering long before President Donald Trump rolled out his far-reaching tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April.",
      "The department issues the revisions every year, intending to better account for new businesses and ones that had gone out of business. Final revisions will come out in February 2026.",
      "The updated figures came after the agency reported Friday that the economy generated just 22,000 jobs in August, well below the 80,000 economists were expecting.",
      "Also last week, the government said that U.S. employers advertised 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists had forecast and the first time since April of 2021 that there were more unemployed Americans than job postings.",

      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs and have mostly settled in a historically low range between 200,000 and 250,000 since the U.S. began to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic nearly four years ago.",

      "Running back Austin Ekeler hurt his right Achilles tendon on a non-contact play and defensive end Deatrich Wise Jr. was carted off the field with a quadriceps injury during the Commanders' 27-18 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thursday night.",
      "Now the Commanders wait to learn how much time these two veterans will miss. Commanders coach Dan Quinn had no immediate update on their conditions after the game.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll use the weekend to see where we\u2019re at from the injuries,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a guess.\u201d",
      "Losing either player for a big chunk of the season could prove costly for the Commanders, who made a surprise appearance in the NFC championship game last season.",
      "\u201cIt kind of takes the fight out of you a little bit,\" wide receiver Deebo Samuel said. \"All the work that they put in all summer long, and just to see them go down, it kind of hurt. That\u2019s the nature of this game. We pray it\u2019s not as bad as we think it is.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old Wise is in his first season with the Commanders after totaling 34 sacks with the New England Patriots from 2017-24.",
      "Wise\u2019s injury occured after he had gotten though the line of scrimmage and was attempting to block an extra-point attempt in the second quarter. Green Bay\u2019s blockers fell backward and landed on the back of Wise\u2019s leg.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\" wide receiver Terry McLaurin said. \"Two guys who are veterans for our team, and we lean on them a lot, not just for their play, but their leadership. To see both of them go down, especially Wise, you never want to see that. It just kind of puts in perspective the sport that we play. We\u2019re just praying for him and Austin that they can make a speedy recovery.\u201d",
      "The potential loss of Ekeler is particularly concerning, considering how much Washington's offense struggled against Green Bay.",
      "Ekeler's pass-catching ability out of the backfield makes him valuable. The 30-year-old Ekeler had 367 yards rushing and 366 yards receiving for the Commanders last season. He entered this season with over 4,700 career yards rushing and over 4,200 yards receiving.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m obviously hoping and praying for the best for him,\" Commanders center Tyler Biadasz said. \"We all know Ek and what he\u2019s capable of doing. He\u2019s a great back that we have, and, obviously, we want him out there full go.\u201d",

      "Rangers All-Star pitcher Jacob deGrom is excited to be going back to where his career began",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Jacob deGrom is excited to be going back to where his career began, the home stadium where he made 109 of his 245 starts in the big leagues and had back-to-back Cy Young Award-winning seasons with the New York Mets.",
      "\u201cIt holds a special place in my heart,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cI pitched a lot there, and Mets fans were always good to me. So taking the mound in front of that crowd was always a fun experience.\u201d",
      "Now the lanky right-hander will find out if that holds true when pitching against them.",
      "DeGrom is set to face the Mets on Friday night for the first time since leaving in free agency after the 2022 season and signing with the Texas Rangers. The teams contending for playoff spots in their respective leagues open a three-game series at Citi Field.",
      "\u201cWith what he did for the Mets, how much time he spent there, I'm sure he's probably going to have some memories and emotions even before he pitches,\u201d Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cHe'll be well-received, no doubt. But it's going to be a big game, so there may be some scattered boos in there.\u201d",
      "The 37-year-old deGrom (11-7, 2.78 ERA) was the only All-Star player from the Rangers this season. His 27 starts and 155 2/3 innings are the most since his last Cy Young Award in 2019, before the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and then a series of injury-plagued years with New York and Texas.",
      "\u201cThe main thing coming into this year was try to take the ball as many times as I can. I didn\u2019t know how many times that would be. ... The goal is to just keep it going,\" deGrom said this week.",
      "\u201cHe looks great, he does. I\u2019m really pleasantly surprised at how well this has gone for him this year because, you know, you don\u2019t know,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cThis is a lot of work for him after that surgery and not pitching for a couple of years, almost three. ... Yeah, it\u2019s gone very well.\u201d",
      "Earlier this season, deGrom set a Rangers franchise record with 14 consecutive starts going at least five innings and not giving up more than two runs. That same span was the longest streak by any traditional starter (not including openers) in the modern era since 1900 of not allowing more than six hits and two runs in a game, according to STATS. He also came the closest he ever has to a no-hitter when allowing only a leadoff single in the eighth inning June 25 at Baltimore, a month after the only start in his career without a strikeout.",
      "When Texas played the Mets each of the past two seasons, deGrom both times was recovering from the Tommy John surgery he had after only six starts in his Rangers debut. They went to New York late in the 2023 season before winning their first World Series championship that fall, and hosted a three-game series in Arlington last year.",
      "In his last start at Citi Field, deGrom had 13 strikeouts in five innings without a decision in the Mets' win over Pittsburgh on Sept. 18, 2022. His major league debut was also there, when he went seven innings and allowed the lone run in a 1-0 Subway Series loss to the Yankees on May 15, 2014.",

He was shut down during spring training in 2022 after a stress reaction in his right scapula, then was 5-4 with a 3.08 ERA in 11 starts over the final two months of that season before becoming a free agent.",
      "The $185 million, five-year contract deGrom signed with Texas included a conditional sixth-year club option for 2028 that was triggered because of the time missed after Tommy John surgery. That option is worth at least $20 million, and could be up to $37 million depending on his total innings pitched and if finishing top five in Cy Young voting.",

The Rangers will go from New York to Houston for three games against the AL West-leading Astros, and are also trying to get past division foe Seattle for the American League's final wild card.",

      "Mackenzie Hughes is in Napa trying to get into a pair of $20 million tournaments",
      "NAPA, Calif. -- Mackenzie Hughes of Canada quietly went about his work with a 9-under 63 on Thursday to lead the Procore Championship. The big crowds followed Scottie Scheffler and the U.S. Ryder Cup team and saw mixed results.",
      "For the longest time, Ryder Cup rookie Ben Griffin wasn't even the low Griffin at Silverado until five birdies on the back nine gave him a 64, one shot behind with Matt McCarty. Russell Henley was at 65 with Lanto Griffin.",
      "Scheffler, who hasn't finished lower than eighth place since March, lost one streak on a breezy afternoon in wine country when he was wild off the tee at the par-5 18th and had to settle for par and a 70. That ended 21 consecutive rounds in the 60s.",
      "Ten Ryder Cup players are here for the competition and to try to stay sharp ahead of Bethpage Black in two weeks, and that wasn't lost on them regardless of the scores.",
      "Russell Henley shot 65 and U.S. Open champion J.J. Spaun had a 67. No one else broke 70, though all of them were at par or better. It's not unusual to see prominent players in the same group for television. The difference here is that they're all spending time together \u2014 same wave of tee times, same mansion to hang out in their spare time.",
      "\u201cI think it was a little different today just knowing that all of us were kind of paired in the same little area of tee times, and we obviously did spend a lot of time with each other this week so it definitely feels slightly different than it would have if this tournament was in March,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the Ryder Cup is right around the corner.\u201d",
      "Just don't get the idea this is a social week. Scheffler showed as much when he was visibly frustrated at a shot that defied gravity and stayed in thick rough over a bunker on the par-5 12th. He turned and slammed his club into the ground. The stance was so awkward that when he finally figured out how to play it, he had to jump down into the bunker after he hit it.",
      "Scheffler made par. He made par on all the the par 5s, contributing to his first score that began with a \u201c7\u201d since his 72 in the third round of the Travelers Championship in June.",
      "\u201cThis is his first go \u2018round here. It\u2019s very goofy,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cI don't think I liked this place the first couple times I came here, but you kind of learn how to play it, you learn where to miss. The greens, especially in the afternoon, are not great. It's just poa annua and they're sloped and they're pretty fast. He just barely missed a few putts. That would have kept his streak going. He'll be fine.\u201d",
      "Hughes is playing for other reasons. He missed out on the top 50 in the FedEx Cup, which would have put him in all the $20 million signature events next year. But anyone finishing in the top 60 are the Fall Series gets into Pebble Beach and Riviera.",
      "The Canadian was had nine birdies in 13 holes and allowed his mind to think briefly about a 59, but only because he thought par was a 71. Either way, a pair of bogeys ended that, though he was happy enough with a 63.",

      "An early-season surge in abuse directed at Black players in competitions across Europe has alarmed anti-discrimination campaigners and highlighted how racism persists in soccer despite multiple initiatives by soccer bodies FIFA and UEFA, national federations and individual clubs to eliminate it.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s more than double what we had last season at the same time,\u201d said Piara Powar, executive director of the Fare network, an anti-discrimination group which works with the global and European soccer bodies to monitor and advise on incidents at games.",
      "\u201cIf you layer social-media issues on top of that,\u201d Powar added in a phone interview, referencing the abuse of England player Jess Carter at the Women\u2019s European Championship this summer, \u201cthen you really are getting into a lot of stories coming out.\u201d",
      "Frustrated at the lack of progress, some Black players have called for tougher penalties against offenders from both the justice system and soccer institutions.",

      "The man arrested on suspicion of hurling abuse at Semenyo in the Premier League opener against Liverpool was released on bail and told he cannot go within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of a soccer stadium in Britain while police investigate the incident.",
      "Soccer's tribal culture and frenzied fan base makes it a prime stage for societal problems like racism to surface. English soccer had a particularly harrowing time with racism in the 1970s and \u201980s when Black players were regularly subjected to monkey chants and offensive slurs.",
      "A generation later, racial abuse of players is more common in social media but also continues in stadiums. A high-profile example came in Spain in 2023 when Real Madrid's Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior confronted a supporter who called him a monkey. Months earlier, four people hung an effigy of the Brazilian player off a highway bridge, resulting in prison sentences this year.",
      "Soccer\u2019s governing bodies have struggled to stamp out the problem, despite measures such as longer bans for players, heavier fines for clubs, partial stadium closures, points deductions and a three-step protocol used by referees when racism occurs in matches.",
      "FIFA recently fined the soccer federations of Albania, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina for offenses including racism during World Cup qualifiers they hosted in June. Argentina, Colombia and Chile also were punished for what FIFA said was \u201cdiscrimination and racist abuse.\"",

      "Powar said there was \u201cmore awareness\u201d of racist incidents happening in soccer, mainly because of increased media coverage, but was still surprised to see so many reports so early in a season. He suggested a heightened focus on migration in European politics may have contributed to the surge.",

      "The NHL says the five players acquitted of sexual assault charges stemming from an incident in 2018 will be eligible to sign a contract Oct. 15 and play Dec. 1",
      "NEW YORK -- The NHL is reinstating five players who were acquitted of sexual assault charges stemming from an incident in 2018 when they were members of Canada's world junior team, announcing Thursday they will be eligible to sign a contract Oct. 15 and take part in games Dec. 1.",
      "The move comes roughly seven weeks since Carter Hart, Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote and Alex Formenton were found not guilty by a judge in London, Ontario. The Canadian government told lawyers for the players last month it would not appeal the ruling.",
      "They were not in the NHL at the time of the incident.",
      "None of the players had current contracts and all are free agents. Hart was with Philadelphia, McLeod and Foote with New Jersey, and Dube with Calgary, while Formenton was playing in Europe, and their respective teams let their previous deals expire last year after charges were laid.",
      "The NHL conducted its own investigation beginning in the spring of 2022 when the allegations came to light. It called the events that transpired \u201cdeeply troubling and unacceptable\u201d and that while they were not found to be criminal, said the players' conduct did not meet the standard of moral integrity.",
      "The players met with league officials after the verdict and expressed regret and remorse, the NHL said. Keeping them from playing until Dec. 1 brings their total time away to nearly two years.",
      "The NHL Players' Association in a statement said it was pleased Dube, Foote, Formenton, Hart and McLeod are getting the opportunity to resume their careers.",
      "\u201cThe players cooperated with every investigation,\u201d the union said. \u201cUpon their full acquittal by Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia, we initiated discussions with the NHL regarding the players\u2019 return to work. To avoid a protracted dispute that would cause further delay, we reached the resolution that the league announced today. We now consider the matter closed and look forward to the players\u2019 return.\u201d",
      "Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly, earlier in the week, said an update was coming \u201cin the relatively near future\" and declined to go into the contents of the investigative process.",
      "\u201cObviously, we take the matter very seriously, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s still under review,\u201d Daly said Tuesday in Las Vegas.",
      "Asked about Hart on Thursday in Voorhees, New Jersey, the head of the company that owns the Flyers, said they would not comment at this point.",

      "Hart, McLeod, Dube and Foote last took part in NHL games in January 2024 before leaving their teams with charges pending. It was not immediately clear how many of the players would be signed when eligible, though Hart as a 27-year-old goaltender with significant experience appears to be the most likely.",

      "Luzardo made his case to Philadelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson to finish the game \u2014 but no dice.",
      "Not with Jhoan Duran around to close it out.",
      "Luzardo had to settle for retiring his final 22 batters Thursday night in one of his most dominant performances this season, one made even more astounding by the fact he gave up five hits and four runs in the first inning.",
      "In his third start of the year with at least 10 strikeouts and no walks, Luzardo got run support from Otto Kemp and Bryce Harper in a 6-4 comeback win over the New York Mets.",
      "Kemp homered and had three RBIs for the Phillies, who swept the four-game series. They have won eight of 10 overall and are poised to secure their second straight division title. The victory pushed their NL East lead over New York to 11 games with 15 to play, and they could clinch this weekend against Kansas City.",
      "\u201cThe whole game, really, was probably as impressive a win as we've had all year,\u201d Thomson said.",
      "Luzardo (14-6) hasn't lost since Aug. 14 and has steadied himself after a rough patch in the middle of the season.",
      "He threw 23 pitches in the first inning and only 74 the rest of the game. The left-hander did it all without realizing he hadn't permitted a baserunner over the final seven innings.",
      "\u201cI knew it had been a while, but I wasn't sure,\u201d Luzardo said. \u201cIn the eighth, the first was already kind of a blur, so I didn't really think too much of it.\u201d",
      "Even with Philadelphia ace Zack Wheeler out for the season because of complications from a blood clot, Luzardo, Cristopher S\u00e1nchez and Ranger Su\u00e1rez are about as formidable a top of the rotation as any contender has in baseball.",
      "Throw in playoff veteran Aaron Nola, who returned to form with six shutout innings in the first game of the series, and it's no wonder the Phillies believe they can finally win it all after falling short each of the last three postseasons.",
      "\u201cIt's hard to lose one of, if not the best, pitchers in baseball,\u201d Luzardo said. \u201cThe only thing we can do is continue and kind of step up and do as well as we can. I think everyone's done that.\u201d",
      "The new guys sure help.",
      "Luzardo, who had battled various injuries throughout his career, was acquired on the cheap in the offseason from the Marlins.",
      "But just look at the makeover since the July 31 trade deadline.",

      "Isak, who joined Liverpool for $170 million on Sept. 1, didn't train with Newcastle during preseason or in the first weeks of the Premier League campaign as the striker pushed for a move away from the northeast club.",
      "While on international duty recently for Sweden in World Cup qualifying, he didn't play at all in the 2-2 draw against Slovenia and came on as a 72nd-minute substitute \u2014 for his first appearance of the season \u2014 in a 2-0 loss to Kosovo.",
      "Isak could make his debut for Liverpool at Burnley in the league on Sunday, but it is likely to be from the bench.",
      "\u201cWe will treat Alex the same as they did,\u201d Slot said, referring to Sweden's management of Isak. \"Don't expect him to be every single game, 90 minutes, on the pitch \u2014 that\u2019s definitely not going to happen in the upcoming weeks.",

      "\u201cHe gets one of the best, maybe the best striker in the world and he needs to play two very important games for his country but understands if he would play him twice, for 90 minutes, the player would probably be injured for multiple weeks,\u201d Slot said.",

      "USA Football is constantly on the hunt for talent to join the flag football team ahead of the 2028 Sumer Games in Los Angeles",
      "DENVER -- The basic flag-football player requirements are as follows: Swiveling hips for elusive jukes. Quick burst. Elite pass catching, throwing or defensive prowess.",
      "You know, pretty much those skills you see on display every week in NFL games. But it's not all that will make a player a prime roster pick down the road when flag football make its Olympic debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.",
      "USA Football is taking a deep dive into just what skills and characteristics make an ideal flag-football player. The organization responsible for picking what's sure to be a star-studded roster is leaving nothing to chance to bring home a gold medal. It's always on the lookout for even more talent, no matter the level of football experience or even the sport.",
      "Time is ticking, too, because three Super Bowls from now, the Olympics will be on deck. Skills specific to flag football need to be honed \u2014 should any NFL player want to give it a go \u2014 and chemistry built (it's more nuanced than showing up for the Pro Bowl version).",
      "Because, \"not every single athlete is going to understand the nuances of the game of flag,\u201d said Charles Torwudzo, the head of player personnel at USA Football. \u201cSo that\u2019s going to be a big portion of it, as well as understanding of the game, the football IQ.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s easy to just assume NFL players will make up a bulk of the 10-player Olympic roster after the league voted in May to allow players to participate. But the NFL is still sorting out how to handle the logistics, especially since the Olympics fall in the middle of training camp.",
      "David White, the interim executive director of the NFL Players Association, recently told The Associated Press that, \u201cour players are like every other American citizen. So many of them would jump at the chance to represent their country.\u201d He added they haven't spoken directly to the league yet, \"but we look forward to doing so.\u201d",
      "Just don't overlook all those flag-football specialists. This is a men's squad that\u2019s won five straight International Federation of American Football world championships.",
      "USA Football relies on different data points to assess players at practices, camps and on game days. For instance, there's KPI (key performance indicators), an internal evaluation that measures variables such as burst, quickness, hip transition and body control. The organization also relies on readouts from Catapult, a wearable device that monitors everything from heart rate to speed.",
      "Although USA Football is always searching for more ways to crunch analytics, there's one indicator that's time-tested.",
      "\u201cHow well they play,\" Torwudzo said. \"How well they can get open, catch the ball and make plays.\u201d",
      "The next flag-football breakout sensation could be on an NFL practice squad right now. Or already a Pro Bowler. Maybe it's a recently retired player or someone playing in Canada. It might even be someone running track, playing rugby or lacrosse. Perhaps already on the U.S. flag football squad or in the flag-football system.",
      "Like a lot of NFL players, Arizona Cardinals safety Joey Blount is intrigued by flag football being an Olympic sport. He has the inside scoop on that version of football thanks to his college teammate at Virginia, Sean Moore, who's a receiver/rusher in the U.S. flag football pipeline.",
      "Blount has what flag football covets most \u2014 flexibility. Sure, he' a defensive back for Arizona, but he was a receiver and quarterback growing up.",
      "\u201cFootball can take me to the Olympics?\" Blount said. \"I would love to do that.\u201d",

      "Not long after Brittany Force went 343.51 mph in the fastest run in NHRA history, the two-time Top Fuel world champion announced Friday she is retiring at the end of the season to focus on starting a family.",
      "Force, the second of four drag racing daughters of 16-time champion John Force, married Bobby Lyons at the end of last season and told The Associated Press she's ready to shift into a new role of motherhood. Brittany Force turned 39 in July.",
      "\u201cIt's something that as a female in NHRA drag racing that has always been in the back of my mind,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI watched my sisters get into the scene and have their careers and then ultimately had to make the decision to step out so they can try to start a family. Ashley has two little boys, Courtney has two little girls and has a third on the way. Because of that, it's always been in the back of my mind because being a female in the sport, it is definitely more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Brittany Force's announcement comes the same week Leah Pruett, wife of NASCAR Hall of Famer Tony Stewart, said she will return to NHRA in 2026, two years after stepping out of the dragster to start a family. Their son was born in late in 2024.",
      "Brittany Force said she has not ruled out a return to racing after starting a family.",
      "Known as \"The Queen of Speed,\u201d Force set the new NHRA Top Fuel world speed record last weekend at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis. It broke her previous record of 343.16 mph set in Sonoma in July.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t hear anything on my radio and then they repeated the 343 speed and I thought they were joking,\" she recalled. \" I\u2019m so pumped and so excited to do this in front of all the fans here. The stands were packed. We\u2019ve run great mph lately, but to jump over 342 and go right to 343, I still can\u2019t believe we did it.\u201d",
      "At the start of the season, Force held the speed record of 338.94, a mark that had stood since 2022. Force has now made 10 runs of 340 mph or faster since April, setting even more new landmarks and milestones in the sport. Nobody had reached 340 before this year in Top Fuel.",
      "Her 18 wins are tied with Shirley Muldowney for the most in Top Fuel history and Force has now made nine of the 10 fastest runs in Top Fuel history.",
      "\u201cWhat we get to do is awesome. I\u2019m very proud to be able to drive this car, work with this team and I\u2019m so proud of what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish,\u201d she said.",
      "Force has spent her entire career driving for John Force Racing, time spent with her father and crew members who have become family in a luxury afforded to few racers.",

Her presence in this sport will be greatly missed. Although she\u2019s stepping out of the seat at the end of the year, her focus is still firmly set on winning the championship and ending this season strong for all her sponsors.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official\u2019s August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws \u2014 which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\u201d but didn't elaborate further. Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s government hasn\u2019t disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion along with other company officers at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",

      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him too.",

      "Many on social media have reminisced about seeing the giant Pacific octopus named Ghost when they had visited the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Some shared that they had a tattoo of Ghost or would wear a sweater emblazoned with the beloved cephalopod in her memory.",
      "\u201cShe is a wonderful octopus and has made an eight-armed impression on all of our hearts,\u201d the aquarium said on Instagram.",
      "Ghost laid eggs earlier this week and entered the last phase of her life cycle, known as senescence. During this period, the octopus will neglect her own basic needs like eating, instead focusing on protecting her eggs and aerating them to prevent bacteria or other harmful agents from growing on them.",
      "Ghost's eggs are unfertilized and will never hatch, however. In the wild, giant Pacific octopuses spend their whole lives alone and only come together for a brief instance to reproduce.",
      "\u201cYou really can\u2019t combine males and females for any period of time because they don\u2019t naturally cohabitate,\u201d said the aquarium's vice president of animal care, Nate Jaros. \u201cThey\u2019re at high risk or aggression or even potentially death.\u201d",
      "Ghost is originally from the waters of British Columbia, Canada, and arrived at the aquarium in May 2024 from a scientific collector. She was only 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) then but now weighs more than 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms).",
      "The average giant Pacific octopus lives for three to five years. Ghost is estimated to be between two and four years old, Jaros said.",
      "Ghost was a \u201csuper active and very physical octopus\u201d who enjoyed spending time with humans, Jaros said.",

      "\u201cShe mastered it almost instantly,\u201d Jaros said.",
      "While Ghost receives special attention in a private tank during her last days, the aquarium has already received a new octopus that will carry on her mission of educating the public.

      "Some small-scale farmers in the southern African country of Malawi are using an AI chatbot for advice to help them improve their methods and become more resilient to climate change",
      "MULANJE, Malawi -- Alex Maere survived the destruction of Cyclone Freddy when it tore through southern Malawi in 2023. His farm didn't.",
      "The 59-year-old saw decades of work disappear with the precious soil that the floods stripped from his small-scale farm in the foothills of Mount Mulanje.",
      "He was used to producing a healthy 850 kilograms (1,870 pounds) of corn each season to support his three daughters and two sons. He salvaged just 8 kilograms (17 pounds) from the wreckage of Freddy.",
      "\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he said, remembering how his farm in the village of Sazola became a wasteland of sand and rocks.",
      "Freddy jolted Maere into action. He decided he needed to change his age-old tactics if he was to survive.",
      "He is now one of thousands of small-scale farmers in the southern African country using a generative AI chatbot designed by the non-profit Opportunity International for farming advice.",
      "The Malawi government is backing the project, having seen the agriculture-dependent nation hit recently by a series of cyclones and an El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought. Malawi\u2019s food crisis, which is largely down to the struggles of small-scale farmers, is a central issue for its national elections next week.",
      "More than 80% of Malawi's population of 21 million rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, according to the World Bank.",
      "The AI chatbot suggested Maere grow potatoes last year alongside his staple corn and cassava to adjust to his changed soil. He followed the instructions to the letter, he said, and cultivated half a soccer field's worth of potatoes and made more than $800 in sales, turning around his and his children's fortunes.",
      "\u201cI managed to pay for their school fees without worries,\u201d he beamed.",
      "Artificial intelligence has the potential to uplift agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 33-50 million smallholder farms like Maere's produce up to 70-80% of the food supply, according to the U.N.'s International Fund for Agricultural Development. Yet productivity in Africa \u2014 with the world's fast-growing population to feed \u2014 is lagging behind despite vast tracts of arable land.",
      "As AI's use surges across the globe, so it is helping African farmers access new information to identify crop diseases, forecast drought, design fertilizers to boost yields, and even locate an affordable tractor. Private investment in agriculture-related tech in sub-Saharan Africa went from $10 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "But to work in Malawi, AI still needs a human touch. For Maere's area, that is the job of 33-year-old Patrick Napanja, a farmer support agent who brings a smartphone with the app for those who have no devices. Chongo calls him the \u201chuman in the loop.\"",
      "\u201cI used to struggle to provide answers to some farming challenges, now I use the app,\" said Napanja.",
      "Farmer support agents like Napanja generally have around 150-200 farmers to help and try to visit them in village groups once a week. But sometimes, most of an hour-long meeting is taken up waiting for responses to load because of the area's poor connectivity, he said. Other times, they have to trudge up nearby hills to get a signal.",
      "They are the simple but stubborn obstacles millions face taking advantage of technology that others have at their fingertips.",
      "For African farmers living on the edge of poverty, the impact of bad advice or AI \u201challucinations\u201d can be far more devastating than for those using it to organize their emails or put together a work presentation.",
      "Mvalo, the tech specialist, warned that inaccurate AI advice like a chatbot misidentifying crop diseases could lead to action that ruins the crop as well as a struggling farmer's livelihood.",
      "\u201cTrust in AI is fragile,\" he said. \"If it fails even once, many farmers may never try it again.\u201d",
      "The Malawian government has invested in Ulangizi and it is programmed to align with the agriculture ministry's own official farming advice, making it more relevant for Malawians, said Webster Jassi, the agriculture extension methodologies officer at the ministry.",
      "But he said Malawi faces challenges in getting the tool to enough communities to make an extensive difference. Those communities don't just need smartphones, but also to be able to afford internet access.",
      "For Malawi, the potential may be in combining AI with traditional collaboration among communities.",
      "\u201cFarmers who have access to the app are helping fellow farmers,\u201d Jassi said, and that is improving productivity.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Humans may be right-handed or left-handed. It turns out octopuses don't have a dominant arm, but they do tend to perform some tasks more often with their front arms, new research shows.",
      "Scientists studied a series of short videos of wild octopuses crawling, swimming, standing, fetching, and groping -- among other common activities -- to analyze how each of the eight arms were moving.",
      "\u201cAll of the arms can do all of this stuff \u2013 that\u2019s really amazing,\u201d said co-author and marine biologist Roger Hanlon of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.",
      "Octopus limbs aren\u2019t specialized as many mammal limbs are. However, the three octopus species in the study showed a clear preference for using their four front arms, which they did about 60% of the time. The back arms were used more frequently for stilting and rolling that help move the octopus forward.",
      "\u201cThe forward arms do most of the exploring, the rear arms are mostly for walking,\u201d said Mike Vecchione, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist who was not involved in the study.",
      "Researchers analyzed video clips taken between 2007 and 2015 in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. It was the first large study to examine precise limb actions in the wild.",
      "Unlike previous research of octopus behavior in a laboratory setting, the new work showed that octopuses did not show a preference for right or left arms in their natural environment.",
      "Results were published Thursday in Scientific Reports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in awe that the researchers managed to do this,\u201d said Janet Voight, an octopus biologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, who had no role in the study.",

      "Australia has approved a world-first vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A regulator has approved a world-first vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia infections, which are causing infertility and death in the iconic native species that is listed as endangered in parts of Australia.",
      "The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.",
      "The research showed the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.",
      "The recent approval by Australia\u2019s veterinary medicine regulator means the vaccine can now be used in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the field to protect the nation\u2019s most at-risk koalas, Timms said on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe knew a single-dose vaccine \u2014 with no need for a booster \u2014 was the answer to reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across all wild populations in Australia,\u201d Timms said in a statement.",
      "\u201cSome individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in southeast Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50% and in some cases can reach as high as 70%,\u201d\u202fTimms added.",
      "Deborah Tabart, chair of the conservation charity Australian Koala Foundation, said resources being spent on vaccinating koalas should be redirected at saving koala habitat.",
      "\u201cAt the risk of sounding flippant, how can anyone be so delusional as to think that you can vaccinate 100,000 animals? It\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Tabart said on Friday.",
      "Tabart\u2019s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.",
      "\u201cI accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they\u2019re sick because they haven\u2019t got any habitat,\u201d Tabart said.",
      "The Queensland Conservation Council, an umbrella organization for more than 50 environmental groups across the state, welcomed the vaccine. But the council's director, Dave Copeman, echoed Tabart\u2019s focus on preserving koala habitat.",

      "The book report is now a thing of the past. Take-home tests and essays are becoming obsolete.",
      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",
      "Cuny\u2019s students at Valencia High School in southern California now do most writing in class. He monitors student laptop screens from his desktop, using software that lets him \u201clock down\u201d their screens or block access to certain sites. He\u2019s also integrating AI into his lessons and teaching students how to use AI as a study aid \u201cto get kids learning with AI instead of cheating with AI.\u201d",
      "In rural Oregon, high school teacher Kelly Gibson has made a similar shift to in-class writing. She is also incorporating more verbal assessments to have students talk through their understanding of assigned reading.",
      "\u201cI used to give a writing prompt and say, \u2018In two weeks I want a five-paragraph essay,\u2019\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThese days, I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s almost begging teenagers to cheat.\u201d",
      "Take, for example, a once typical high school English assignment: Write an essay that explains the relevance of social class in \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Many students say their first instinct is now to ask ChatGPT for help \u201cbrainstorming.\u201d Within seconds, ChatGPT yields a list of essay ideas, plus examples and quotes to back them up. The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself. ChatGPT also helped her through a freshman philosophy class, where assigned reading \u201cfelt like a different language\u201d until she read AI summaries of the texts.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",
      "But this year, her teachers have strict \u201cNo AI\u201d policies. \u201cIt\u2019s such a helpful tool. And if we\u2019re not allowed to use it that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lahey says. \u201cIt feels outdated.\u201d",

The term \u201cAI literacy\u201d has become a buzzword of the back-to-school season, with a focus on how to balance the strengths of AI with its risks and challenges.",

The guidance offered language for three sample syllabus statements \u2014 for courses that require AI, ban AI in and out of class, or allow some AI use.",

      "At Carnegie Mellon University there has been a huge uptick in academic responsibility violations due to AI but often students aren\u2019t aware they\u2019ve done anything wrong, says Rebekah Fitzsimmons, chair of the AI faculty advising committee at the university\u2019s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.",
      "For example, one English language learner wrote an assignment in his native language and used DeepL, an AI-powered translation tool, to translate his work to English but didn\u2019t realize the platform also altered his language, which was flagged by an AI detector.",
      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity. Faculty have been told that a blanket ban on AI \u201cis not a viable policy\u201d unless instructors make changes to the way they teach and assess students. A lot of faculty are doing away with take-home exams. Some have returned to pen and paper tests in class, she said, and others have moved to \u201cflipped classrooms,\u201d where homework is done in class.",
      "Emily DeJeu, who teaches communication courses at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s business school, has eliminated writing assignments as homework and replaced them with in-class quizzes done on laptops in \u201ca lockdown browser\u201d that blocks students from leaving the quiz screen.",

Now, anyone with the Zoox app will be able to request a ride to five designated locations, including Resorts World, the Luxor hotel and the New York-New York hotel. The longest distance the Zoox robotaxis will travel is about three miles (4.8 kilometers) while carrying up to four passengers.",
      "All rides will be provided for free for at least the first few months to help promote the existence of the service in the perennially popular travel destination. Once it begins charging for rides in Las Vegas, Zoox says its prices will be comparable to traditional taxis and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.",
      "Zoox can afford to give free rides largely because of Amazon's deep pockets. The e-commerce powerhouse, currently worth $2.5 trillion, bought Zoox for $1.2 billion five years ago as part of its efforts to establish a foothold in other fields of technology.",
      "The Las Vegas market marks Zoox's first step in its attempt to catch up with robotaxi leader Waymo, a Google spin-off that offers that already provides driverless rides in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin, Texas (where Tesla is still in the testing phase of a robotaxi service that its CEO, Elon Musk, has been hyping for the past decade).",

      "NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA\u2019s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \u201cexciting discovery,\u201d a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute\u2019s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst\u2019s Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why we can\u2019t go so far as to say, \u2018A-ha, this is proof positive of life,'\u2019\u2019 lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \u201cAll we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\u201d",
      "Either way, Hurowitz said it\u2019s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover\u2019s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\u201cIt would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.\u201d",
      "Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance\u2019s science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.",
      "The findings appeared in the journal Nature.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A ship likely cut cables in the Red Sea that disrupted internet access in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, experts said Tuesday, showing the lines' vulnerability over a year after another incident severed them.",
      "The International Cable Protection Committee told The Associated Press that 15 submarine cables pass through the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the southern mouth of the Red Sea that separates East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "Over the weekend, authorities in multiple countries identified the cables affected as the South East Asia\u2013Middle East\u2013Western Europe 4, the India-Middle East-Western Europe and the FALCON GCX cables. On Tuesday, that list expanded to include the Europe India Gateway cable as well, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the firm Kentik.",
      "Initial reporting suggested the cut happened off the coast of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, something authorities in the kingdom have not acknowledged, nor have the companies managing the cables.",
      "\u201cEarly independent analysis indicates that the probable cause of damage is commercial shipping activity in the region,\u201d John Wrottesley, the committee's operations manager, told the AP. \u201cDamage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults.\u201d",
      "Madory also told the AP that the working assumption was a commercial vessel dropped its anchor and dragged it across the four cables, severing the connections. Cabling in the Red Sea can be at a shallow depth, making it easier for an anchor drag to affect them.",

      "However, rerouting traffic can cause latency, or lag, for internet users. Madory said it appeared at least 10 nations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East had been affected by the cable cut. Among those nations were India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s completely offline, but each provider has lost a subset of their international transit,\u201d Madory said. \"So if you imagine this is like an equivalent to plumbing and you lose some volume of water coming down the pipes ... and now you just have less volumes to carry the traffic.\u201d",
      "Cable security also has been a concern amid attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In early 2024, Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack undersea cables. Several later were cut, possibly by a ship attacked by the Houthis dragging its anchor, but the rebels denied being responsible.",

      "Nepal's crackdown on social media companies, which led to protests and police killing at least 19 people, is part of a yearslong decline of internet freedoms around the world as even democracies seek to curtail online speech.",
      "The Himalayan country\u2019s government said last week it was blocking several social media platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube because the companies failed to comply with a requirement that they register with the government. The ban was lifted Tuesday a day after the deadly protests.",
      "What's happening in Nepal mirrors \u201cthis broader pattern of controlling the narrative and controlling of stories emerging from the ground,\u201d said Aditya Vashistha, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University. \u201cThis has happened several times in the neighboring countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. So this is nothing new \u2014 in fact, I would say this is taken from the playbook, which is now very established, of trying to control social media narratives.\u201d",
      "Like neighboring countries, Nepal's government have been asking the companies to appoint a liaison in the country. Officials are calling for laws to to monitor social media and ensure both the users and operators are responsible and accountable for what they share. But the move has been criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online.",
      "\u201cGovernments absolutely have a valid interest in seeking to regulate social media platforms. This is such a daily part of our lives and in our business. And it is certainly reasonable for authorities to sit down and say we want to develop rules for the road,\u201d said Kian Vesteinsson, senior research analyst for technology and democracy at the Washington-based nonprofit Freedom House.",
      "\u201cBut what we see in Nepal is that wholesale blocks as a means of enforcing a set of rules for social media companies results in wildly disproportionate harms. These measures that were put in place in Nepal (cut) tens of millions of people off from platforms that they used to express themselves, to conduct daily business, to speak with their families, to go to school, to get healthcare information.\u201d",
      "It's not just Nepal. Freedom House has found that global internet freedom has declined for the 14th consecutive year in 2024, as governments crack down on dissent and people face arrest for expressing political, social or religious views online. While China consistently tops the list as the \u201cworld's worst environment\u201d for internet freedom, last year Myanmar shared this designation as well. The organization did not track Nepal.",
      "India passed a telecommunications law in 2023 that gave its government \u201cbroad powers to restrict online communications and intercept communications,\" according to Freedom House. Three years earlier, a sweeping internet law put digital platforms like Facebook under direct government oversight. Officials say the rules are needed to quell misinformation and hate speech and to give users more power to flag objectionable content. But critics cautioned it would lead to censorship in a country where digital freedoms have already been shrinking.",
      "In January, meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament passed a bill that gives the government sweeping controls on social media, including sending users to prison for spreading disinformation.",
      "Calling internet freedom a \u201cpillar of modern democracy,\u201d Freedom House said a healthy 21st-century democracy cannot function without a trustworthy online environment, where people can access information and express themselves freely.",
      "Increasingly, though, governments are putting up roadblocks.",

      "In the Nepali law, for instance, \u201cthe same provision of this law, directs social media platforms to restrict content relating to child trafficking and human trafficking and labor, a really important issue,\" he added. \"Two bullet points above that, it orders platforms to restrict people from posting anonymously.\u201d",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said Monday that the protests \u201cunderscore the widespread concerns over Nepal\u2019s ban on social media and the pressing need for the government to drop its order. Such a sweeping ban not only restricts freedom of expression, it also severely hinders journalists\u2019 work and the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d",
      "The crackdown appears to have spurred a surge in use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, according to Proton, which provides encrypted services. Signups for Proton\u2019s VPN service in Nepal have jumped by 8,000% since Sept. 3, according to data the company posted online. A VPN is a service that allows users to mask their location in order to circumvent censorship or geography-based online viewing restrictions.",
      "But experts caution that VPNs are not an end-all solution to government internet blocks. They can be expensive and out of reach for many people, Vashistha noted, and they can be slow and lead to lower-quality experiences when people try to access blocked social platforms.",
      "Google, Meta, X and TikTok (which registered and continues to operate) didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",

The public outrage over the ban and the deaths of 19 protesters on Monday led to the resignation of the prime minister and exposed deep discontent over corruption.",

      "\u201cProtests over the social media ban were just a catalyst. Frustrations over how the country is being run have long been simmering under the surface.

      "Demonstrations in Nepal have been called the protest of Gen Z, which generally refers to people born between 1995 and 2010.

      "A new study finds that climate change is increasing sugar consumption in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global warming in the United States is amping up the country's sweet tooth, a new study found.",
      "When the temperature rises, Americans \u2014 especially those with less money and education \u2014 drink lots more sugary beverages and a bit more frozen desserts. That amounts to more than 100 million pounds of added sugar (358 million kilograms) consumed in the nation a year, compared to 15 years earlier, according to a team of researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom.",
      "When temperatures go between 54 and 86 degrees (12 and 30 degrees Celsius), the amount of sugar the average American consumes goes up by about 0.4 grams per degree Fahrenheit (0.7 grams per degree Celsius) per day, based on researchers tracking of weather conditions and consumers' purchases. At 54 degrees, the amount of added sugar for the average American is a little more than 2 grams. At 86 degrees, it\u2019s more than 15 grams.",
      "Beyond that, appetites lessen and added sugar falls off, according to the study in Monday's Nature Climate Change.",
      "\u201cClimate change is shaping what you eat and how you eat and that might have a bad effect on your health,\u201d said study co-author Duo Chan, a climate scientist at the University of Southampton.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to take in more sweetened beverages as the temperature is getting higher and higher,\u201d Chan said. \u201cObviously under a warming climate that would cause you to drink more or take in more sugar. And that is going to be a severe problem when it comes to health.\u201d",
      "The daily difference from higher temperatures doesn't amount to even a single candy bar for the average person. But it adds up over time and has a big effect, said University of California San Francisco endocrinology professor Dr. Robert Lustig, a specialist in pediatrics and obesity who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Lustig wrote in an email that among poorer Americans, just one added can of sugary soft drink per day increases diabetes risk by 29% \u2014 and temperature-related thirst plays a big part in America\u2019s obesity epidemic.",
      "The United States\u2019 average annual temperature has gone up about 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) since 1895, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "To chart the impact on sugar consumption, researchers compared it to the American Heart Association recommendations: limiting daily intake to 36 grams for men and 25 grams for women.",
      "The team then compared wind, precipitation and humidity records to the detailed purchase records of 40,000 to 60,000 American households from 2004 to 2019, not using any data after the pandemic hit. Then they looked at the nutritional information of the items bought. That allowed them to eliminate other factors to make a causal link and come up with a calculation for how much extra sugar is consumed per person per degree, said lead author Pan He, an environmental scientist at Cardiff University.",

      "The researchers found that men consumed more sugary soft drinks, and that the amount of added sugar consumed during hot weather was several times higher for low- and very low-income families than for the wealthiest, the study found.",
      "People who work outside drank more sugary drinks than those who work inside, and the same went for families where the head of the household was less educated. White people have the highest added sugar effect, while Asians showed no significant change in added sugar in the heat.",
      "Lustig said sugary drinks are marketed and priced in a way to attract the poor, and in many disadvantaged communities the water tastes funny because of chemicals in them. Poor people are also less likely to have air conditioning and are more likely to work outside and need more hydration, Lustig and He said.",
      "\u201cIt should concern us that the rate of the impact is larger in households where people make less money or are less educated,\u201d said Dr. Courtney Howard, vice chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance. \u201cThese groups tend to have lower baseline health status, so this is an area where climate-related changes appear to magnify existing health inequalities.\u201d",

      "At the Port of Los Angeles on a site that once housed oil tanks, seven steel structures that look like small blue boats are lowered into the ocean, where they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate power",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.",
      "This is the nation\u2019s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port \u2014 enough to power up to 60,000 homes.",
      "Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a \u201cgame changer in terms of clean energy production\u201d for the port and the communities around it. America\u2019s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,\u201d she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project\u2019s power station.",
      "Wave energy is an emerging industry that\u2019s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.",
      "Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America\u2019s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.",
      "Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port\u2019s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,\u201d said R\u00e9mi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.\u201d",
      "A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.",
      "But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.",
      "The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.",
      "As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.",

      "\u201cAnd we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,\u201d he said.",
      "Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn\u2019t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.",
      "The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.",
      "Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.",
      "Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power\u2019s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.",

      "The classmate added that they never observed Robinson expressing any outward \"hate or malice towards other people.\"",
      "\"I never heard him talk politically,\" said the classmate, who emphasized that they were not close friends. \"I never heard him talk about guns.\"",
      "During a news conference on Thursday evening, prior to identifying Robinson, state and federal officials released video of the person of interest jumping down from the roof of a building on the campus.",
      "Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, said the suspect was wearing \"distinct clothing\" that could help in his identification, including Converse sneakers.",
      "He said the person seen in the video jumping from the roof left shoe impressions and a palm print.",
      "\"We are investing everything we have into this and we will catch this individual,\" Mason said at the news conference.",
      "Authorities had received more than 7,000 tips and leads and completed some 200 interviews, Cox said.",
      "Bohls said the weapon, a high-powered bolt-action rifle, was found discarded in a wooded area near Utah Valley University (UVU) in Orem, and is being analyzed at an FBI laboratory.",
      "The gun and cartridges recovered were to be flown to the FBI's main laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for the most technologically advanced forensic analysis, law enforcement sources told ABC News. The focus is to look for any latent fingerprints and DNA, the sources said.",
      "Investigators also collected a footwear impression, a palm print and forearm prints for analysis, Bohls said.",
      "Mason said that investigators are also studying \"good video footage\" of the shooter that they have used to track his movements before and after the shooting.",
      "Following Thursday's news conference, the FBI in Salt Lake City released surveillance images of the person of interest wanted in connection with the shooting. The images showed a person who appears to be a white male, wearing all dark clothing, including a dark long-sleeved collarless top with what appears to be an image on the front that includes an American flag. The man in the images is also wearing a dark ball cap and sunglasses.",
      "The FBI announced a $100,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the capture of the suspect.",
      "Mason said investigators believe the suspect arrived at the UVU campus at 11:52 a.m. local time, about 28 minutes before Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative grassroots organization Turning Point USA, was shot.",
      "Mason said the deadly shot was fired from a building a substantial distance from where Kirk was speaking to a crowd that authorities estimate was about 3,000 people. He did not disclose which building the shooter fired from.",
      "\"We have tracked his movements onto the campus, through stairwells, up to the roof, across the roof to the shooting location,\" Mason said. \"After the shooting, we were able to track his movements as he moved to the other side of the building, jumped off of the building, and fled off of the campus into a neighborhood.\"",
      "He said investigators combed the neighborhood for the suspect and contacted residents with doorbell cameras to analyze.",
      "Brad Garrett, a retired FBI agent and an ABC News contributor, said the evidence investigators have shared so far paints a picture of a suspect who planned the shooting down to the last detail, including discarding the possible murder weapon along his escape path.",
      "\"He probably did that [because] he didn't want to be seen carrying a weapon, running through a neighborhood, or walking through a neighborhood,\" Garrett said.",
      "Garrett said the discovery of the killer's palm print can also be helpful.",
      "\"If he's ever had a full set of prints, where you print the entire hand, let's say he'd been in the military or some aspect of the government or a contractor, they may have those,\" Garrett said. \"That's a long shot, but they may have those.\"",

      "\"Ladies and gentlemen, we got him,\" Cox said at a press conference Friday.",
      "Robinson, 22, has been booked into the Utah County Jail. Charging documents against Robinson are expected to be filed early next week, Cox said.",
      "He was arrested for felony discharge of a firearm, aggravated murder and obstruction of justice, according to the probable cause documents.",

      "Investigators interviewed a family member of Robinson who said the suspect had \"become more political in recent years,\" Cox said.",
      "In a recent incident the family member detailed to investigators, Robinson came to dinner and in a conversation with another family member he mentioned Kirk was coming to Utah Valley University. They talked about why they didn't like him and his viewpoints.",
      "Forensic evidence has been seized and continues to be gathered. Forensic evidence is already been evaluated at FBI laboratories in Quantico, FBI Director Kash Patel said. Over 11,000 leads were called into the FBI, he said.",
      "Among the evidence was the rifle, retrieved from a bush near the building where the shooting took place, and several bullet cartridges with writing on them. One said, \"Hey fascist! CATCH!\" -- which Cox said \"speaks for itself\" -- while another had the Italian lyrics to a song, \"Bella, ciao,\" and another said, \"If you read this, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Officials do not anticipate making any other arrests at this time, Cox said. He said he could not speak to whether the suspect was cooperating with law enforcement.",

      "Cox urged young people to build a \"culture that is very different than what we are suffering through right now.\"",
      "\"To my young friends out there, you are inheriting a country where politics feels like rage. It feels like rage is the only option. But through those words, we have a reminder that we can choose a different path,\" Cox said.",
      "The press conference came soon after President Donald Trump confirmed they had the suspected shooter in custody.",
      "\"I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody,\" Trump said on \"Fox & Friends\" earlier Friday morning.",
      "He later added, \"Subject to change but the facts are the facts we have the person that we think is the person we're looking for.\"",

      "Federal prosecutors have charged the leaders of a church with congregations in five states with swindling millions of dollars in educational benefits from military service members",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Leaders of a Georgia-based church with congregations in five states have been charged by federal prosecutors with swindling millions of dollars in veterans benefits from parishioners serving in the military.",
      "An indictment unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Savannah charges House of Prayer Christian Churches of America founder Rony Denis and seven other church leaders with conspiring to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, as well as other federal crimes.",
      "Authorities say church leaders exploited soldiers and other congregation members by enrolling them in seminary programs that drained their G.I. Bill education benefits. They also say church officials used parishioners' names on fraudulent mortgage applications to buy homes that the church then rented to congregation members.",
      "\u201cThe defendants are accused of exploiting trust, faith, and even the service of our nation\u2019s military members to enrich themselves,\u201d Paul Brown, the agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office, said in a news release.",
      "Prosecutors say they don't even know the real name of Denis, alleging he assumed that name after stealing another person's identity in 1983. He founded House of Prayer roughly two decades ago. The church is headquartered in Hinesville, a southeast Georgia city that is home to thousands of veterans and Army soldiers serving at neighboring Fort Stewart. The congregation there grew to as many as 300 members, the indictment says.",
      "House of Prayer branched out, opening up to a dozen churches in five states, often near military bases, according to prosecutors. It also established affiliated Bible seminaries in Hinesville as well as Fayetteville, North Carolina; Killeen, Texas; and Tacoma, Washington.",
      "The indictment says the church focused on recruiting military service members to join their congregations and pressured them to spend their G.I. Bill education benefits on enrollment in its seminary programs.",
      "The seminaries in all four states earned House of Prayer leaders $23.5 million in G.I. Bill payments for tuition, fees, books and housing costs from 2013 and 2021, according to the indictment.",
      "Charges against Denis and others stem from just $3.2 million of those benefit payments made to House of Prayer's two seminaries in Georgia. That is because the programs operated in Georgia under a religious exemption granted by state regulators. Prosecutors say that exemption prohibited the Georgia seminaries from receiving federal funding \u2014 including G.I. Bill benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.",

      "The indictment says church officials also used its members as straw buyers to conceal the leaders' purchase of rental properties. Prosecutors say church leaders falsified loan applications and closing documents and forged powers of attorney to buy and transfer homes that were rented to congregation members.",
      "The indictment says House of Prayer received $5.2 million in rent payments between 2018 and 2020, with some of that money being used to pay for Denis' two homes as well as church leaders' credit card bills.",
      "Denis was also charged with helping falsify his federal income tax returns for 2018, 2019 and 2020. On Wednesday, FBI agents and Columbia County sheriff's deputies arrested the church founder at his mansion in Martinez west of Augusta, WRDW-TV reported.",

      "High school and college educators say that student use of artificial intelligence has become so widespread that they need to rethink how to assign and assess students",
      "The book report is now a thing of the past. Take-home tests and essays are becoming obsolete.",
      "High school and college educators around the country say student use of artificial intelligence has become so prevalent that to assign writing outside of the classroom is like asking students to cheat.",
      "\u201cThe cheating is off the charts. It\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in my entire career,\u201d says Casey Cuny, who has taught English for 23 years. Educators are no longer wondering if students will outsource schoolwork to AI chatbots. \u201cAnything you send home, you have to assume is being AI\u2019ed.\u201d",
      "The question now is how schools can adapt, because many of the teaching and assessment tools that have been used for generations are no longer effective. As AI technology rapidly improves and becomes more entwined with daily life, it is transforming how students learn and study, how teachers teach, and it\u2019s creating new confusion over what constitutes academic dishonesty.",
      "\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, what is cheating?\u201d says Cuny, a 2024 recipient of California\u2019s Teacher of the Year award. \u201cBecause I think the lines are getting blurred.\u201d",
      "Cuny\u2019s students at Valencia High School in southern California now do most writing in class. He monitors student laptop screens from his desktop, using software that lets him \u201clock down\u201d their screens or block access to certain sites. He\u2019s also integrating AI into his lessons and teaching students how to use AI as a study aid \u201cto get kids learning with AI instead of cheating with AI.\u201d",
      "In rural Oregon, high school teacher Kelly Gibson has made a similar shift to in-class writing. She is also incorporating more verbal assessments to have students talk through their understanding of assigned reading.",
      "\u201cI used to give a writing prompt and say, \u2018In two weeks I want a five-paragraph essay,\u2019\u201d says Gibson. \u201cThese days, I can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s almost begging teenagers to cheat.\u201d",
      "Take, for example, a once typical high school English assignment: Write an essay that explains the relevance of social class in \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Many students say their first instinct is now to ask ChatGPT for help \u201cbrainstorming.\u201d Within seconds, ChatGPT yields a list of essay ideas, plus examples and quotes to back them up. The chatbot ends by asking if it can do more: \u201cWould you like help writing any part of the essay? I can help you draft an introduction or outline a paragraph!\u201d",
      "Students say they often turn to AI with good intentions for things like research, editing or help reading difficult texts. But AI offers unprecedented temptation and it\u2019s sometimes hard to know where to draw the line.",
      "College sophomore Lily Brown, a psychology major at an East Coast liberal arts school, relies on ChatGPT to help outline essays because she struggles putting the pieces together herself. ChatGPT also helped her through a freshman philosophy class, where assigned reading \u201cfelt like a different language\u201d until she read AI summaries of the texts.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel bad using ChatGPT to summarize reading, because I wonder is this cheating? Is helping me form outlines cheating? If I write an essay in my own words and ask how to improve it, or when it starts to edit my essay, is that cheating?\u201d",
      "Her class syllabi say things like: \u201cDon\u2019t use AI to write essays and to form thoughts,\u201d she says, but that leaves a lot of grey area. Students say they often shy away from asking teachers for clarity because admitting to any AI use could flag them as a cheater.",
      "Schools tend to leave AI policies to teachers, which often means that rules vary widely within the same school. Some educators, for example, welcome the use of Grammarly.com, an AI-powered writing assistant, to check grammar. Others forbid it, noting the tool also offers to rewrite sentences.",
      "\u201cWhether you can use AI or not, depends on each classroom. That can get confusing,\u201d says Valencia 11th grader Jolie Lahey, who credits Cuny with teaching her sophomore English class a variety of AI skills like how to upload study guides to ChatGPT and have the chatbot quiz them and then explain problems they got wrong.",
      "But this year, her teachers have strict \u201cNo AI\u201d policies. \u201cIt\u2019s such a helpful tool. And if we\u2019re not allowed to use it that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lahey says. \u201cIt feels outdated.\u201d",

The guidance offered language for three sample syllabus statements \u2014 for courses that require AI, ban AI in and out of class, or allow some AI use.",

      "At Carnegie Mellon University there has been a huge uptick in academic responsibility violations due to AI but often students aren\u2019t aware they\u2019ve done anything wrong, says Rebekah Fitzsimmons, chair of the AI faculty advising committee at the university\u2019s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.",
      "For example, one English language learner wrote an assignment in his native language and used DeepL, an AI-powered translation tool, to translate his work to English but didn\u2019t realize the platform also altered his language, which was flagged by an AI detector.",
      "Enforcing academic integrity policies has been complicated by AI, which is hard to detect and even harder to prove, said Fitzsimmons. Faculty are allowed flexibility when they believe a student has unintentionally crossed a line but are now more hesitant to point out violations because they don't want to accuse students unfairly, and students are worried that if they are falsely accused there is no way to prove their innocence.",
      "Over the summer, Fitzsimmons helped draft detailed new guidelines for students and faculty that strive to create more clarity. Faculty have been told that a blanket ban on AI \u201cis not a viable policy\u201d unless instructors make changes to the way they teach and assess students. A lot of faculty are doing away with take-home exams. Some have returned to pen and paper tests in class, she said, and others have moved to \u201cflipped classrooms,\u201d where homework is done in class.",

      "School choice resurfaced Thursday as a hotly debated issue in Kentucky, where the state's highest court heard arguments in a bitter dispute over the constitutionality of a measure to publicly fund charter schools.",
      "The measure, known as House Bill 9, was enacted by the state's GOP-dominated legislature in 2022 over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's veto. It would funnel taxpayer dollars to support charter schools. It was struck down by a lower court judge, setting up the climactic review by the Kentucky Supreme Court.",
      "The outcome could decide whether charter schools gain a foothold in the Bluegrass State.",
      "Supporters say charter schools offer another choice for parents looking for the best educational fit for their children. A goal, they say, is to close student achievement gaps. Opponents say such schools would divert needed funds from existing public schools and could pick and choose which students to accept.",
      "Charter schools are operated by independent groups with fewer regulations than most public schools. They have been legal in Kentucky since 2017, but none have opened because of the lack of a method to fund them. The disputed law enacted a few years later was meant to fill that funding gap and mandated the opening of charter schools on a pilot basis in Louisville and northern Kentucky.",
      "Kentucky is among a handful of states where charter school's don't operate.",
      "\u201cSo Kentucky kids are really on the outside looking in, on what has been a resounding success \u2014 especially in urban areas,\u201d state Solicitor General Matt Kuhn said in defending the disputed law during the hearing in Danville, Kentucky.",
      "Byron Leet, one of two attorneys presenting for education groups opposed to the measure, countered that \"there is nothing remotely resembling a consensus that charter schools are a wonderful thing.\u201d",
      "Arguments focused on whether charter schools meet the constitutional standards of public schools.",
      "Charter schools would have to comply with student attendance standards, hire certified teachers, meet state standards for student performance and adhere to open records and open meetings laws, Kuhn said.",
      "\u201cI think that House Bill 9 fits neatly in our tradition\" of public schools, he said.",
      "Leet responded that charter schools would be \u201cautonomous in matters of finance, personnel, curriculum and instruction \u2014 four very significant areas for any school.\"",
      "\"They are on an island by themselves as far as how they will operate,\" he added.",

      "An underlying test for public schools, based on decades of legal precedents, is whether they are controlled by elected officials within a school district, Leet said. Charter schools, meanwhile, would be operated by independent boards whose members would not be elected by local voters, he said.",
      "Kuhn noted that, in most instances, the local school board would serve as the authorizing body for a proposed charter school in the district, resulting in significant local control.",
      "He said it would be up to parents to decide whether to send their children to a charter school.",
      "\u201cTheir kids only go there if they choose,\" he said. \"And our submission would be that\u2019s the best form of accountability \u2014 given that we presume that parents know best for their kids.\u201d",
      "Hanging over the case was a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed state lawmakers to appropriate tax dollars for educational opportunities outside the public school system. That ballot measure was overwhelmingly defeated by statewide voters in the 2024 general election.",
      "\u201cShould that impact our decision, or should we just ignore the nearly two-thirds of the voters who do not wish to have taxpayer funds used in this manner?\u201d Justice Pamela R. Goodwine asked.",
      "That outcome doesn't apply to charter schools because they wouldn't be outside the public school system, attorneys defending the charter school law said.",
      "The justices did not indicate how soon they will rule on the matter.",
      "Two of the state's top leaders weighed after the court hearing.",
      "Beshear, the state's two-term governor who is widely seen as a potential contender for the White House in 2028, said the way to improve student performance is to increase state education funding and to look at giving existing public schools the type of regulatory flexibility envisioned for charter schools.",
      "\u201cThe answer can't be to divert just some small group of students to some different system,\u201d Beshear said at a news conference in Frankfort, the state's capital. \u201cThe answer has to be one that lifts everyone up, and that is better investing in our public school system.\u201d",
      "Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman, whose office is defending the charter school funding law, said Kentucky parents deserve the same options as those in states where charter schools operate.",
      "\"Kentucky\u2019s kids deserve every chance to succeed, and we\u2019re proud to stand alongside our partners in the General Assembly to fight for that opportunity,\u201d he said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Some Nebraska lawmakers and residents say the Republican governor's plan to convert a prison into an immigration detention center has come with few details about the transition",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- No formal agreement has been signed to convert a remote state prison in Nebraska into the latest immigration detention center for President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown, more than three weeks since the governor announced the plan and as lawmakers and nearby residents grow increasingly skeptical.",
      "Corrections officials insist the facility could start housing hundreds of male detainees next month, with classrooms and other spaces at the McCook Work Ethic Camp retrofitted for beds. However, lawmakers briefed last week by state officials said they got few concrete answers about cost, staffing and oversight.",
      "\u201cThere was more unanswered questions than answered questions in terms of what they know,\u201d state Sen. Wendy DeBoer said.",
      "Officials in the city of McCook were caught off guard in mid-August when Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced that the minimum-security prison in rural southwest Nebraska would serve as a Midwest hub for immigration detainees. Pillen and federal officials dubbed it the \u201cCornhusker Clink,\" in line with other alliterative detention centers such as \u201c Alligator Alcatraz \u201d in Florida and the \u201c Speedway Slammer \u201d in Indiana.",
      "\u201cCity leaders were given absolutely no choice in the matter,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Dell, publisher of the local newspaper, the McCook Gazette.",
      "McCook is the seat of Red Willow County where voters favored Trump in the 2024 election by nearly 80%. Most of them likely support the president's immigration crackdown, O'Dell said. However, the city of around 7,000 has also grown accustomed to the camp's low-level offenders working on roads, in parks, county and city offices and even local schools.",
      "\u201cPeople here have gotten to know them in many cases,\u201d O'Dell said. \u201cI think there is a feeling here that people want to know where these folks are going to end up and that they'll be OK.\u201d",
      "The Work Ethic Camp first opened in 2001 and currently houses around 155 inmates who participate in education, treatment and work programs to help them transition to life outside prison. State leaders often praise it as success story for reducing prisoner recidivism.",
      "Some lawmakers have complained that Pillen acted rashly in offering up the facility, noting that the state's prison system is already one of the nation's most overcrowded and perpetually understaffed. The governor's office and state prison officials met with members of the Legislature's Judiciary Committee last week to answer questions about the transfer.",
      "What the lawmakers got, several said, were estimates and speculation.",
      "Lawmakers were told it was the governor's office that approached federal officials with the offer after Trump \u201cmade a generalized, widespread call that we need more room or something for detainees,\u201d said DeBoer, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.",

      "The costs of the transition would be borne by the state, with the expectation that the federal government would reimburse that cost, DeBoer recalled.",
      "A formal agreement between the state and federal agency had yet to be signed by Friday.",
      "Asked how much the state is anticipated to spend on the conversion, the agency said \"that number has not yet been determined,\" but that any state expenditures would be reimbursed. The state plans to hire additional staffers for the center, the agency said.",
      "A letter signed by 13 lawmakers called into question whether Pillen had the authority to unilaterally transfer use of a state prison to federal authorities without legislative approval.",
      "To that end, state Sen. Terrell McKinney \u2014 chairman of the Legislature's Urban Affairs Committee and a vocal critic of Nebraska's overcrowded prison system \u2014 convened a public hearing Friday to seek answers from Pillen's office and state corrections officials, citing concerns over building code violations that fall under the committee's purview.",
      "\"How can you take a facility that was built for 125 people and take that to a capacity of 200 to 300 people without creating, you know, a security risk?\u201d McKinney asked.",
      "Pillen maintains state law gives him the authority to make the move, saying the Department of Correctional Services falls under the umbrella of the executive branch. He and state prison officials declined to show up at Friday's hearing.",
      "But dozens of Nebraska residents did attend, with most of them opposed to the new ICE detention center.",

So, look for group activities where you can meet more people, take an exercise class, take a yoga class, take a painting class, join a choir and sing, and see if your partner is interested in doing those things together.\"",

      "Some parents and guardians become empty nesters much later in their children's lives when they stay through college or their first jobs, especially in intergenerational households.",
      "For the Marlows, it felt like the empty nester title was on and off as one of their children moved back home when he started a job after school in the same city, and another child attended a local university minutes from home. But they said they knew they would continue to be a part of their children's lives and continue to parent, even if they were away from home, and technology helps with that continued connection.",
      "\u201cTo this day, we maintain a lot of interest in their lives. We don't want to intrude but we want to be there to offer them advice, encouragement, praise, all that kind of stuff,\u201d Marlow said.",

      "Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and Salvadorans.

The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.",

      "The clothes designed by Giorgio Armani (July 11, 1934-Sept. 4, 2025) very much reflected relaxed elegance \u2013 a supercool attitude that blurred divisions between men's and women's clothing. Forming the Giorgio Armani Company in 1975, he first made menswear, then launched a women's line, one that recut a traditional men's suit jacket.",
      "Armani told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006 that it was a response to the emerging feminist movement; he thought women needed their own sexy version of boardroom attire. \"When I started blending men and women's fashions many years ago, the public often became uneasy and perplexed,\" he said.",
      "Born in Piacenza, Italy, Armani's was a childhood ravaged by World War II, his family's home destroyed by bombs. Though he hadn't dreamed of a career in design, a temporary job in a department store made him realize he had a knack. Rising through the ranks, he worked for designer Nino Cerutti, but lacked formal training of his own.",
      "In 1966, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman who became his partner in work and in life. Galeotti encouraged Armani to begin designing on his own.",
      "Armani would put Italian ready-to-wear style on the international fashion map in the late 1970s. His liningless sports jacket, paired with a T-shirt, was an instant success, while his women's pantsuit was revolutionary. He landed on the cover of Time magazine, and his clothes found their way into countless films (including \"American Gigolo\"), and on the red carpet.",
      "After the death of Galeotti in 1985, Armani continued the company, building it into a $10 billion empire encompassing not just fashion but also home design, bars and restaurants, perfumes, cosmetics, and even a basketball team, Olympia Milano.",
      "A perfectionist, Armani would worry about every detail, no matter how small. When asked what he felt when releasing a new collection, Armani replied, \"I am terrified.\""

    "summary": "Four physicians, who recently resigned from the CDC in protest, tell \"Sunday Morning\" they believe HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is jeopardizing the nation's public health.",
    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On Aug. 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",
      "That same day, the Trump White House said Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had just been confirmed by the Senate weeks earlier, was fired.",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2014 not skeptics \u2014 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2014 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2014 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2014\u00a0now featuring Kennedy appointees\u00a0\u2014 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust.

      "The University of Michigan's preliminary September sentiment index, released Friday, declined 4.8% to 55.4 from 58.2 in August.",
      "\"Consumers continue to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation. Likewise, consumers perceive risks to their pocketbooks as well,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at U. of Michigan,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Tariff policies are top of mind for many Americans, too, she said, noting that about 60% of consumers raised the topic in interviews.",
      "Inflation expectations for the year remained steady at 4.8%. Consumers' long-run inflation expectations, however, rose for a second straight month to 3.9% in September, according to the survey, as consumers become aware of \"what tariffs mean for them,\" High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "A separate U. of Michigan report on trade policy and consumer spending found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that are subject to tariff-related price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that have large price increases, according to the August report.",
      "\"The corrosive uncertainty surrounding tariffs, other economic policies and immigration, continues to weigh on consumer sentiment, High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note. \"Rising consumer prices and the reality of the consequences of tariffs are just starting to be felt by consumers. They are saying, 'Ouch!'\"",
      "Sentiment declined most among low-income households, who are most vulnerable to the effects of tariffs, which are a regressive tax. Such households \"won't benefit from recent equity gains and will feel the sticker shock of tariffs most acutely,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note. \"We expect tariffs and fiscal policy changes will widen the bifurcation of American consumers.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's tariffs are slowly rippling through the economy and starting to push up prices for some products, government data shows.",
    "story": [
      "For much of 2025, the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs defied forecasts\u00a0that the import duties would drive up inflation. But that reprieve appears to be over, with economic data this week showing the tariffs are now pushing prices higher.",
      "The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, accelerating from the previous month as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy. Heavily imported goods saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, the data show. The increase represents the fastest rate of inflation since January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "Although the tariffs were first announced in April on what Mr. Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" their implementation was largely delayed as the administration negotiated new trade deals with multiple nations over the ensuing months. That gave U.S. companies time to prepare for the new import duties, which are paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government.",
      "Facing the prospect of sharply higher tariffs, some American companies scrambled to stock up on the imported goods and parts they use in their business, postponing the need to raise customer prices. Others absorbed the levies instead of passing them along to consumers.",
      "But many companies are now pulling back from those strategies, economic data shows. According to the Federal Reserve's latest \"Beige Book\" survey, which includes responses from businesses, economists and other sources, tariff-related price hikes were visible across the U.S. in August.",
      "Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\u00a0recently told CBS News that some companies facing a hit to their profit margins have no choice but to start passing on tariff-related costs to consumers.",
      "Among the companies to say they are raising prices for some goods as tariffs take effect are\u00a0home improvement giant Home Depot, retailer Macy's and camera maker Nikon.",
      "\"The pass-through from tariffs is gradual because some businesses may have held on to a greater share of the costs and may have shared a greater burden of tariffs,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"But there is a limit to how long and how much of that they can do \u2014 so there may be more of a push to pass those costs onto consumers.\"",
      "The White House said inflation remains low and that Mr. Trump's policies are boosting the economy.",
      "\"Since President Trump took office, CPI is tracking at a 2.3% annualized rate, consistent with low and stable inflation,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Leavitt also noted that data on producer prices out this week point to a decline in wholesale inflation. \"As the Trump economic agenda continues to take effect, the trillions of dollars in private sector and foreign investments, historic tax cuts, massive deregulation and energy dominance that the president is spearheading will fuel an economic boom,\" she added.",
      "Tariff-fueled price hikes",
      "Many types of goods that rely heavily on imports saw significant price hikes last month, the latest CPI report shows.",
      "Coffee, for instance, is largely imported because there are only a handful of places in the U.S. where the beans can be grown, such as Hawaii and Puerto Rico. About 80% of unroasted coffee imports are sourced from Latin America, primarily from Brazil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Products from Brazil that are shipped to the U.S. now face a 50% tariff, according to the White House. Once those import taxes kicked in, U.S. consumers in August shelled out 21% more for beans than a year earlier, according to CPI data.",
      "Other products that are heavily imported and that, as of August, are seeing large price increases compared with a year ago include:",
      "Audio equipment: +12%\u00a0Household furniture: +10%\u00a0Bananas: +6.6%Women's dresses: +6.2%Watches: +5.6%Motor vehicle parts: +3.4%",

      "Motor vehicle parts: +3.4%",
      "Strain on consumers",
      "Prices are edging higher as worker wages are growing more slowly, straining lower-income households.",
      "\"It's troubling that so many basic necessities now cost more. Food, gas, clothing and shelter all had big cost jumps in August,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.\u00a0 \"And this is only the beginning of the price hikes. The situation will worsen in the coming months as more costs are passed along to American consumers.\"",
      "Clara Moore, 44, a public-sector researcher who lives in Newark, New Jersey, told CBS MoneyWatch she is seeing prices \"rising all over the place.\" Her grocery bill has risen to about $250 per haul, from roughly $175 one year ago, she said.",
      "Some economists think tariffs are likely to continue pushing inflation higher throughout the rest of the year, putting more financial pressure on families. As a result, many consumers will spend with more restraint, according to Daco.",
      "\"They are more cautious when it comes to their outlays. They haven't stopped spending, but they'll be more judicious from one month to the next. They'll adjust their spending according to what they need and what's affordable,\" he said.",
      "Moore said she's had to cut back her spending on discretionary goods in order to afford the basics.",
      "\"I'm in the process of cutting out all of my streaming. I stopped ordering anything from Amazon \u2014 any impulse buying I have cut out,\" she said.",
      "Ryan Sweet, Oxford Economics' chief U.S. economist, said consumers should expect to pick up about two-thirds of the cost of new U.S. tariffs on foreign goods.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

      "Regardless of a user's age, the company says its chatbots will attempt to redirect the most distressing conversations to more capable AI models that can provide a better response.",
      "Meta also said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.",

The Virginia advocacy group has released nine COLA estimates so far this year, based on monthly BLS data.",
      "According to the group, a 2.7% COLA would raise the average monthly benefit for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. The Senior Citizens League predicted the same cost-of-living adjustment in August.",
      "The cost-of-living adjustment has averaged 2.6% over the last 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League. A COLA of 2.7% would be higher than this year's adjustment of 2.5%, but below the 3.2% boost seniors received in 2024.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year based on inflation data from July, August and September. Thursday's CPI report shows that the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), the figure the SSA uses to make its annual adjustment, increased 2.8% on an annual basis in August, up from 2.5% the month prior.",
      "The SSA is scheduled to announce its adjustment in October, which would go into effect in January 2026. \"This year, the COLA will be determined on October 15, when the Bureau of Labor and Statistics releases the CPI-W for September,\" the agency told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The COLA is intended to ensure that benefits payments for U.S. seniors keep pace with inflation. However, economists have warned that a 2.7% adjustment may not be enough to stave off the inflationary pressures Americans are facing.",
      "The CPI report released Thursday suggest that inflation is on the rise with CPI rising 2.9% on an annual basis in August compared to 2.7% in July. Imported products such as coffee and furniture have grown more expensive since last year, which economists point out could be due to tariffs pushing up prices.",
      "Routine monthly paycheck reductions for certain Social Security recipients could also cancel out the cost-of-living adjustment, Shannon Benton, the executive director of the Senior Citizens League, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "\"The latest projection of a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026 is certainly better than nothing,\" said Benton, \"but for many seniors, that gain may quickly disappear once higher Medicare Part B premiums are deducted, turning what should be a raise into a wash.\"",
      "She added, \"For those living on fixed incomes, it's another reminder of the gap between benefits and real-world costs.\"",

    "summary": "The ICE raid that swept up 300 South Koreans in Georgia has strained an important bilateral relationship, and highlighted a significant challenge.",
    "story": [
      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were released from a detention center early Thursday and boarded a charter flight back to their country.",
      "The flight, which departed Atlanta, is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News photographer Darrall Johnson watched as the Koreans boarded eight buses that then left for the airport, where a Korean Air charter flight was waiting to fly them home. Johnson said a cart full of documents was loaded onto one of the buses.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in an address delivered Thursday in Seoul, said 316 South Koreans would be on the flight, including 10 women. He said one South Korean had decided to remain in the U.S. as they have family members in the country.   The Foreign Ministry said there were also 14 non-Korean nationals boarding the plane, three Japanese, 10 Chinese and one Indonesian.",
      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",
      "The detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",
      "President Lee Jae Myung, visiting the White House in July, pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment to sweeten a trade-and-tariff deal with President Trump.",
      "\"The sentiment is obviously very, very negative,\" James Kim, Chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, told CBS News. \"In my office, I usually have my TV turned on to the news \u2014 and this is obviously covered from morning to evening constantly. But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, was peppered with demands from angry lawmakers during a parliamentary session in Seoul on Sept. 8, before he departed for meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials.",
      "Lawmaker Kim Joon-hyun demanded that Cho respond to the ICE raid by launching investigations into every U.S. national teaching English in South Korea who could be working illegally on a tourist visa.",
      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",
      "President Trump, in a Sunday post on his Truth Social platform, addressed all foreign companies operating in the U.S., saying \"your investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people.\"",
      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",
      "Rubio, during his meeting Wednesday in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho, \"said the United States welcomes ROK (South Korea) investment into the United States and stated his interest in deepening cooperation on this front,\" according to a readout shared by the State Department, which did not mention the ICE raid in Georgia.",
      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",
      "The ministry's statement said Cho had \"strongly requested the U.S. administration's special attention and support to ensure that these workers, who are not criminals, can quickly depart the US without physical restraint, such as handcuffs, and that they will not face any disadvantages in future visits to the U.S. He also proposed the establishment of a working group between the U.S. and South Korea to discuss various measures, including the creation of new visa categories, to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\"",

      "Despite that, inflation has been creeping higher in recent months, edging away from the Federal Reserve's\u00a02% annual target.\u00a0That's causing some Americans to feel more sour about the economy, with a recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0finding that two-thirds of consumers said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise.",
      "What economists say",
      "Some economists point to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs as pushing prices higher. That's because U.S. businesses pay the import duties to the federal government and then pass on some of those costs to consumers in the form of costlier goods.",
      "So far in 2025, the Federal Reserve has held off on cutting rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "Yet with the labor market showing signs of strain, Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month signaled that the door may be open for a rate cut at the central bank's Sept. 17 meeting.

It takes an average of 30 days between when you start planning a trip and when it's fully finished,\" Skylar Erickson, co-founder of Gondola AI, which helps consumers maximize their loyalty points, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You have 40 tabs open on your browser, so it takes a lot of work to get to that right answer.\"",

      "There are a range of AI-powered apps and bots at consumers' fingertips that can help plan a trip \u2014 from inception to booking. AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money.

It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch.tytrf \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",

      "President Trump last month fired then BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of political bias after the Labor Department's July employment report showed unexpectedly weak job growth and revised down payroll gains for the previous two months.",

    "summary": "The Consumer Price Index likely inched higher in August, reflecting higher costs for food and other items, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "For Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Maine with her two elementary school-aged children, the cost of running a household is only getting more expensive, from buying groceries to paying for her home's upkeep.",
      "\"It's really challenging,\" McBlais, who works at a nonprofit, says of managing her expenses. \"It's paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Cleaning her chimney cost $500 this year, up from about $200 when she bought her house in 2019. And grocery money isn't going as far either, prompting McBlais to stretch meals to make sure the family has leftovers. \"I honestly don't expect anything to go back to the way they were \u2014 it's a matter of things leveling off where they are at,\" she said.",
      "McBlais' concerns and struggles come as the pace of inflation continues to creep higher, remaining well above the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to an annual 2% rate. The situation is leaving some consumers feeling frustrated by stubbornly high prices on everything from groceries to housing,\u00a0souring their views\u00a0about the health of the U.S. economy.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CBS News poll, two-thirds of Americans said that prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, with nearly all saying they expect the rise in costs to continue.",
      "On Thursday, the Consumer Price Index is expected to show that prices rose at an annualized rate of 2.9% in August, up from 2.7% in July. Some economists point to the Trump administration's tariffs as a contributing factor.",
      "\"Tariffs will raise prices, and that does of course lead to inflation \u2014 there's no way around that,\" said Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at the Villanova School of Business.",
      "To be sure, inflation is well below its pandemic peak. But the Federal Reserve's progress has been slipping, with recent CPI data showing price growth picking up again after reaching a low point this spring.",
      "At the same time, President Trump is pushing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate, posting on social media on Wednesday that there is \"no inflation!!!\" He also urged the Fed to \"lower the RATE, BIG, right now.\"",
      "In July 2024, when Mr. Trump pledged to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" the CPI rate stood at 2.9%, or the same pace that economists forecast for tomorrow's report.",
      "\"The president would like people to stop paying attention to inflation now because it's not helping it,\" Kersting noted. \"In the past he wanted people to pay attention to it, because back then it did help him win the election.\"",
      "Asked for comment on forecasts the CPI will show an uptick in inflation, the White House said the president is delivering on his promises.",
      "\"Joe Biden unleashed the worst inflation crisis in nearly four years \u2014 President Trump ended it. Despite the media's false narrative, core inflation has run at a 2.4% average pace since President Trump took office which is the lowest 6-month pace since March 2021. The so-called 'experts' have been wrong month after month: tariffs have not hiked prices and President Trump is delivering on his promise to make America affordable again,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve's complicated decision",
      "A hotter CPI report would complicate the Federal Reserve's task of deciding its next interest rate move on Sept. 17, given that the labor market has stalled out this summer. The Fed's so-called \"dual mandate\" requires it to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "So far in 2025, the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady, with Chair Jerome Powell saying he wanted to keep the central bank's powder dry in case tariffs caused inflation to reignite. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "But two consecutive disappointing jobs reports signal that the labor market is stalling out, putting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which can help bolster hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow and add more workers. Powell last month signaled the Fed may be open to a cut, pointing to the labor market's risks.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut is pegged at 90% by CME FedWatch, which bases its forecast on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices. There's a slimmer 10% likelihood that the Fed could usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, its data shows.",
      "A rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, with interest fees on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans likely to drop after a reduction. But households are still continuing to face higher prices at the grocery store and for household bills, experts note.",
      "\"Budget pressure has never fully let up for many households, even as inflation subsided during 2024 and early 2025,\" Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and Bankrate financial analyst, said in an email. \"Current and future inflation expectations feel like a slow, painful walk down memory lane.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has said he is firing Cook from her role over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Tuesday's ruling \"will not be the last say on the matter.\"",
      "\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" Desai said.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "While the Fed did cut interest rates last year, after they had reached their highest point in decades in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to fight off inflation, the central bank has recently kept rates at relatively high levels. Powell has cited concerns that lowering rates could again lead to a swift rise in inflation and that Mr. Trump's tariffs could also lead to an increase in consumer prices.",

    "story": [
      "Getting cash from an ATM is growing increasingly expensive as fees reach record highs.",
      "Americans are now paying an average of $4.86 for out-of-network ATM withdrawals, up 1.9% from $4.77 last year, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from Bankrate.com. That's the highest on record, according to the personal finance website, which starting tracking ATM fees 27 years ago.",
      "\"ATM fees are just one of those avenues that the bank can very freely continue to charge fees,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those costs include charges from both ATM owners and banks. According to the survey, the average fee from cash machine providers is $3.22. Banks charge $1.64 on average, up 3.8% from 2024 \u2014 the highest since 2018. As a result, Americans in certain metro areas could see average combined fees of more than $5.",
      "For its survey, Bankrate polled a total of 10 banks and financial institutions in 25 of the nation's largest metro areas. Atlanta topped the list for highest ATM costs, with an average out-of-network fee of $5.37. Behind Atlanta are Phoenix and San Diego, where ATM charges average $5.35 and $5.31, respectively.",
      "Boston and Seattle had the lowest average rates among the metro areas surveyed \u2014 $4.37 and $4.42, respectively.",
      "What's behind the rising charges?",
      "The problem, said Kates, is that while there have been regulatory rumblings around curbing overdraft fees, resulting in voluntary caps by financial institutions, there are no limits on how much banks can charge for ATM withdrawals, giving them free rein to hike fees as much as they want. And since the charges apply to people outside the bank's network, there's no risk of it losing customers.",
      "\"It's one of the ways for the bank to certainly make money, and it's one of the ways to do so that doesn't really hurt their own customers,\" Kates said.",
      "Higher fees also help ATM owners and banks make up for lost revenue as consumers gravitate away from using cash and toward digital payments, said Kates. Also, online banking has nearly eliminated the need for automated bank tellers. According to a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the American Bankers Association last year, only 5% of customers relied on ATMs to manage their bank accounts.",
      "To be sure, reliance on cash hasn't disappeared altogether. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that cash was still Americans' primary form of payment as of October 2024 \u2014 whether for a trip to an old-school laundromat or a vexingly cash-only restaurant.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer people need to use cash for certain things, but there are some times when you have to have it,\" said Kates.",
      "How to avoid high ATM fees",
      "Avoiding high ATM fees requires a bit of strategy and forethought, as you may not always be near a bank-affiliated ATM when you need to withdraw cash.",
      "In such a situation, one option is to get cash back at a local store. Kates also encourages people to look at their banking app to see which ATMs are close to them.",
      "If you need to withdraw cash on a regular basis, but live in an area where there aren't any ATMs in-network, you may want to consider changing where you bank to accommodate your needs. Certain online financial services like Fidelity, for instance, reimburse customers for ATM fees \u2014 making them a more attractive option.",

      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:56:54 -0400",
    "summary": "The downward revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the job market was slowing in 2024 and early 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period that ended March 2025 than had earlier been reported, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. The major downward revision signals that the labor market was slowing more last year than had earlier been reported.",
      "The so-called preliminary benchmark revision, produced annually by the BLS, was bigger than a decline of roughly 800,000 that economists had forecast prior to the release. The revision aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed in the 12-month period it covers, as these changes are sometimes missed by the BLS' monthly jobs report.",
      "The downward revision comes as the labor market appears to be ailing, with Friday's\u00a0disappointing August jobs report\u00a0sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. At the same time, the BLS is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with the president last month\u00a0questioning the validity\u00a0of the monthly jobs report after the data included a significant downward revision, prompting him to\u00a0fire the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS.",
      "Revisions are a normal part of the statistical process at the BLS, economists note. That's because the monthly jobs data is based on a survey of businesses, and some companies respond after the agency's initial jobs report has been issued. Because of that, the BLS updates its data to reflect the new information.",
      "The sharp downward annual revision signals that the job market was facing bigger headwinds in 2024 and early 2025 than earlier reported, and could add to the Federal Reserve's case for cutting its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting, economists said.",
      "\"Today's data suggests cooling in the labor market is more dramatic than previously thought,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, in an email.",
      "She added, \"This strengthens the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates next week, as it's additional evidence that the labor market side of the dual mandate needs some attention.\"",
      "Less momentum in job gains",
      "With the new revisions, job growth in 2025 has averaged 44,000 per month, down from 75,000 prior to the revamped numbers, Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. In 2024, payroll gains factoring in the revisions averaged 106,000, down from 168,000 previously.",
      "\"The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,\" he said. \"It's now a lock that the Fed will cut interest rates at their meeting next week and that further rate cuts will follow in the months ahead. The question is by how much.\"",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17 meeting is now projected at 94%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The annual revisions are based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs, or about 11 million workplaces.",
      "The QCEW tracks when businesses open or close, something that is difficult for the monthly jobs report to track. For instance, if a business doesn't respond to the monthly survey, the BLS doesn't immediately know if the company simply isn't responding or if it has shut down.",
      "The large revision is likely due to the QCEW's tracking of businesses that have either been newly created or recently closed, with some of those new companies likely having slower hiring than the BLS had earlier estimated, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note.",
      "\"Probably about two-thirds of the downward benchmark revision looks set to be due to weaker job creation at new firms than the BLS initially inferred from its model,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The typical U.S. taxpayer could see their taxes decrease by more than $3,750 next year thanks to fresh cuts, deductions and other provisions, according to a recent analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by President Trump in July provides a bevy of new tax cuts and deductions that could lower taxes for millions of Americans, according to a recent analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The typical filer could see a tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, the nonpartisan think tank found. But the impact will also vary geographically, with some residents in some states likely receiving a bigger tax benefit than others under the new law, Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For instance, the biggest average cut will go to residents of Wyoming, with a reduction of $5,374, according to his analysis of the law's impact.",
      "The geographic differences are due partly to variations in the average income of each state, given that the law provides bigger tax cuts to high-income Americans\u00a0compared with low-income households, Watson noted. Other provisions also could help some regions more than others. That includes the higher deduction cap for state and local taxes, which will give more of a lift to people in states with high property taxes, such as New Jersey and New York.",
      "\"Places with higher incomes are going to have higher nominal tax cuts,\" Watson said. \"The largest tax benefits are going to the mountain states \u2014 it's due to a subgroup of higher-income business owners.\"",
      "Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia are likely to see the smallest tax cuts next year, the analysis found. Incomes in those states tend to be lower than the national average, with median household income in Mississippi standing at about $55,000 as of 2023 and $60,000 for West Virginians, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The national household median income is about $80,600.",
      "The Tax Foundation analysis projects the average tax cut in tax year 2026, meaning that these numbers reflect the reductions for the next calendar year. Although many of the law's provisions are effective in 2025, the IRS is still working out the details on some of them, which means lower tax withholding for the new provisions won't be fully in place until 2026, Watson said.",
      "Bigger refunds?",
      "Tax refunds are also likely to be larger in early 2026, when people file their taxes for the 2025 calendar year, Watson said, although he hasn't calculated the potential impact.",
      "Seniors who can claim a new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 under the law may get a bigger refund, as well as taxpayers across the board due to the higher standard deduction, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.",
      "Because of the tax changes in the new law, Steber recommends that people start preparing now. For example, workers who are newly eligible for tax breaks on tips and on overtime pay should keep track of such income.",
      "\"Having this much time left in the year allows taxpayers to make any necessary adjustments to help increase a refund or lower an amount due, and can be as simple as adjusting the withholding on a W-4,\" Steber told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The top 1% of earners around the U.S. \u2014 those with incomes over $1.1 million \u2014 will receive a $75,410 annual tax break from the new law in 2026, according to a\u00a0separate analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center, nonpartisan think tank. That compares with an average tax break of $150 for households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, or people earning less than $36,000 a year, and of $1,780 for earning $66,801 to $119,200.",
      "To be sure, many of new law's tax cuts will depend on an individual's financial circumstances. For instance, a low-income worker who earns tips or overtime could see a much bigger tax cut due to the law's \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" provisions, Watson noted.",
      "\"If a taxpayer isn't taking tips or overtime or new car loan deduction, they may see a lower benefit,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estrep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-report-revision-september-9-bls-economy-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 07:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to revise its jobs data downward for the year ended in March 2025. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "The latest jobs report\u00a0points to a labor market that's faltering, but the slowdown may have begun much earlier. Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to issue a major downward revision today, showing the nation added hundreds of thousands fewer jobs than first reported.",
      "On Sept. 9, the BLS will release its preliminary benchmark revision to labor market data at 10 a.m. ET, which aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed. Economists say the revision, covering the 12-month period through March 2025, could show that hiring during that time was about 800,000 jobs lower than previously reported.",
      "The report could draw attention from the Trump administration, as the president last month questioned the validity of the monthly jobs report \u2014 and fired the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS \u2014 after the data included a significant downward revision. Hiring experts and economists point to a job market that's stalling out as some businesses are bearing increased tariff costs while others are tapping artificial intelligence as a way to lower labor costs and\u00a0replace workers.",
      "\"The labor market will likely look even worse after the release of the preliminary benchmark revision to payrolls on Sept. 9,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, noted in an email.",
      "The revision could show that employment was reduced by about 775,000 for the 12 months through March, Adams estimated. That would indicate that the average monthly job growth in 2024 actually stood at 100,000 per month, down from the 165,000 previously reported, he added.",
      "The revision would cover only the first three months of Mr. Trump's second administration, with the bulk of the timeframe occurring in the last year of former President Biden's administration.",
      "Job growth has slowed dramatically in recent months, with the employers adding an average of 29,000 jobs each month from June through August, the most recent BLS data shows.",
      "Why does the government revise its jobs data?",
      "Jobs revisions occur each month, with the BLS updating its data to reflect more recent information it has received from businesses about the pace of hiring. That's because some companies respond late to the BLS' surveys, which means the agency receives an influx of new information after it has issued its initial monthly jobs report, prompting the fresh numbers.",
      "But once a year, the BLS also issues an annual revision based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs.",
      "While the monthly jobs report relies on about 50,000 responses for each period, the QCEW covers 11 million workplaces \u2014 but that scope requires more time for collecting the data versus the BLS' monthly report, Adams of Comerica said.",
      "\"The QCEW's detail lets it directly measure jobs added at newly-opened workplaces and lost at closing ones, which account for several millions of employment churn each year,\" he added.",
      "What happened in the last annual revision?",
      "The BLS issued a\u00a0major downward\u00a0revision last year for the same annual data, showing that employers added 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ended March 2024 than previously estimated. That lowered the average monthly job growth for the period to 174,000, down from the initial estimate of 242,000.",
      "At the time, the downward revision was seen as evidence that the labor market was showing cracks, and it was viewed as paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September 2024 meeting.",
      "What does this mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Fed will be focused on analyzing recent economic data, such as the latest jobs report and the next Consumer Price Index, which will be issued on Sept. 11. Economists expect the CPI to show an annualized increase of 2.9% in August, higher than the prior month's 2.7% and well above the Fed's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "With the labor market hitting a wall in recent months, economists now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting. The only question is whether the Fed might usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, or opt for the typical cut of 0.25 percentage points.",
      "\"Market odds currently see a 100% chance of a Fed rate cut this month, with a small constituent seeing an outsized 50-basis-point cut on Sept. 17 within the realm of possibility,\" Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, wrote in a Sept. 8 research note.",
      "But, he added, if August's Consumer Price Index comes in hotter than expected on Sept. 11, that \"would likely throw cold water on the idea that the Fed is considering an outsized September rate cut.\"",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell\u00a0this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over\u00a0whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority\u00a0to do so. Powell's term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026.",
      "Trump nominates replacement commissioner",
      "President Trump\u00a0in August announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday. Antoni, a fellow at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, has\u00a0criticized the BLS, questioning its methodology.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "In a statement Monday backing the BLS, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), a professional association of global economists, applied economists, data scientists and academics, said it \"stands firmly with the dedicated economists and statisticians at BLS and across the federal statistical agencies.\"",
      "The association went on to urge policymakers and others in the business and economics community \"to defend the integrity of the U.S. statistical system and ensure it remains the global gold standard,\" it said.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics needs a knowledgeable and qualified commissioner who will uphold the agency's mission and protect its trusted professional staff from political pressure. A commissioner with deep expertise and independence is essential to maintaining public trust, ensuring impartial analysis, and safeguarding the credibility of U.S. statistics,\" NABE added.",

    "story": [
      "Job seekers' confidence in finding new employment has fallen, a new\u00a0survey\u00a0reveals.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations, the average \"perceived probability\" of finding a new job after losing one fell 5.8% points to 44.9% among heads of households surveyed in August, the lowest measure on record since 2013 when the New York Fed began collecting data.",
      "At the same time, Americans are increasingly worried about losing their current job. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher a year from now crept up 1.7 percentage points to 39.1%, the New York Fed found.",
      "The data comes as Americans adopt a dimmer view of the economy. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll, a majority of respondents continue to say the economy is getting worse.",
      "The labor market has been under a microscope since July employment data showed weaker-than-expected job growth and sharp downward revisions for the months of June and May. August's data, released Friday, pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs. Unemployment also ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate since October 2022.",
      "\"Employers may be holding onto their current workers amid uncertainty, but they are not adding new positions,\" Allison Shrivastava, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In turn, employees have taken the hint, staying in their current jobs rather than seeking new opportunities.\"",
      "According to a recent Bankrate survey, about half of Americans are planning to search for a new job in the next year. At the same time, data shows that the number of people changing jobs has slowed significantly since 2022, when millions of people quit their jobs during the \"Great Resignation.\"",
      "During this period, workers had more negotiating power because labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. That balance, however, has started shifting back in favor of employers in recent years.",
      "A recent analysis from Bank of America shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downward from a more than 26% peak in 2022, and is now just slightly above the job change rate in 2019, at 3.3%. Experts say that's mainly because there are fewer opportunities for people to switch jobs and general unease with the state of the labor market.",
      "\"If this stagnation continues, unemployment \u2014 and layoffs \u2014 will increase, further weakening the labor market,\" said Shrivastava.",
      "The Fed, which is tasked with maintaining a robust job market and low inflation, has acknowledged that the downside risks to employment are rising. This strengthens the likelihood that the central bank will cut rates at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray plans to file formal charges in the case on Tuesday, according to a spokesperson.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said he was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday.",
      "President Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "A spokesperson for Discord later said it removed an account associated with Robinson and said the company will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement.",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination. He said the gunman is believed to have arrived on campus at 11:52 a.m. local time on Wednesday and moved through stairwells to the roof of a building near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with FBI Director Kash Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 whom Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls.",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "The fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices bulges OwO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"Hey fascist, catch!\" And a second unfired casing read, \"oh bella ciao, bella cio, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read this, you are gay.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "Cox said Friday morning that the suspect was seen on surveillance camera footage arriving on the university campus at approximately 8:29 a.m. in a gray Dodge Challenger. On Thursday, officials had said that the shooter arrived near the campus at around 11:52 a.m. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspect remained on campus the entire time.",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m, which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video \u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time\u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

      "Cox said Robinson resides in Southern Utah and confessed to his father.",
      "Two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News that Robinson's father saw the photos released by authorities and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and his father encouraged him to turn himself in, the sources said. Robinson responded to his father, saying he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said. The pastor and Robinson's father tried to calm him, according to the sources.",
      "The pastor, who is also a court security officer, also called the U.S. Marshals Service, which arrived and detained Robinson, the sources said.",
      "The sources said the Marshals called the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who took Robinson into custody. Robinson was taken into custody late Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday.",
      "Cox said he believed Robinson acted alone, and that there is no information at this time \"that would lead to any additional arrests.\"",
      "Cox thanked the family members of the suspected shooter, who he said \"did the right thing\" in bringing him to law enforcement.",
      "President Trump was the first to announce the suspect was in custody during an appearance on \"Fox and Friends\" on Friday morning.",
      "Cox said a family member told investigators that Robinson had become more political in recent years, and referenced an incident where Robinson had come to dinner and mentioned Kirk's upcoming appearance.",
      "Kirk shot while engaging in campus debate",
      "Kirk, who was 31, was engaging in one of his signature \"Prove Me Wrong\" debates at Utah Valley University when he was shot and killed on Wednesday afternoon. The event was part of Turning Point USA's \"The American Comeback Tour,\" and there were over 3,000 people in attendance when Kirk was shot, police said.",
      "Kirk's next event had been set for Utah State University. The university confirmed that Robinson had attended the school as a pre-engineering major for one semester in 2021 before taking a leave of absence.",
      "Kirk had just\u00a0begun to debate someone in the audience\u00a0about gun violence when he was shot, witnesses said. Just one shot was fired, Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said on Wednesday night. Kirk was struck in the neck.",
      "A university spokeswoman said the single shot is believed to have been fired from the Losee Center for Student Success, which houses a number of services and resources. A law enforcement source told CBS News the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "Details on evidence emerge",
      "After the shooting, the shooter jumped off the building and fled into a neighborhood off campus, Mason said. Photos released by law enforcement showed a person wearing a dark baseball cap, black glasses, a long-sleeved dark shirt that appeared to feature an American flag and an eagle, and dark-colored pants.",
      "Investigators recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle that they believe was used in the assassination, Robert Bohls, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Salt Lake City field office, said Thursday. The gun was found wrapped in a dark towel in a wooded area where the shooter fled, Bohls said.",
      "Cox also said investigators reviewed messages on the messaging platform Discord from a person named \"Tyler\" that referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. A Discord spokesperson confirmed the platform had identified an account associated with Robinson, but said it has \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.\" The spokesperson said the messages Cox referenced do not appear to have been sent on the platform, and described them as \"communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the fired bullet and three unfired ones. The fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices bulges OwO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"Hey fascist, catch!\" And a second unfired casing read, \"oh bella ciao, bella cio, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read this, you are gay.\"",
      "Cox declined to speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "\"I will leave that up to you to interpret what those engravings mean,\" Cox said. He added that the \"Hey fascist, catch!\" inscription \"speaks for itself.\"",
      "The arrest comes after two people were briefly taken into custody, then released, on Wednesday. Neither individual had ties to the shooting, the Utah Department of Public Safety said on Wednesday night. The second person taken into custody was charged with obstruction of justice, the department said.",
      "Kirk was a close ally of Mr. Trump and a friend of Donald Trump Jr.",
      "The president, who ordered flags be flown at half-staff until Sunday evening, announced plans to honor Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling him \"a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people.\" He also released a video statement\u00a0blaming the \"radical left\" for the killing. Politicians and figures on both sides of the aisle have condemned Kirk's killing.",

      "Pritzker has vocally opposed having the National Guard deployed to Chicago. As rumors swirled of a deployment he warned Mr. Trump, \"Do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here, nor needed here.\"",
      "This past weekend, Pritzker responded to Trump's \"Chipocalypse Now\" post on his Truth Social account with a post on X, writing, \"The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal. Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.\"",
      "Friday morning, Pritzker tweeted in response to the Memphis news, \"It's disturbing that the President is hellbent on sending troops onto America's streets.  Using those who serve in uniform as political props is insulting.  None of this is normal.\"",
      "In his \"Fox and Friends\" appearance, Trump claimed the deployment of the National Guard to Memphis had the support of both Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, and Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat.",

We agree with Governor Lee that effective support for Memphis comes through focused initiatives that deliver results like we have seen with the FBI, state troopers, and other law enforcement partnerships.

Kirk pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",

Still, in some instances \u2014 like his efforts to fire certain executive officers \u2014 the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,\" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a \"huge sweeping victory\" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.",
      "Tariffs",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.",
      "The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.",
      "The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.",
      "The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.",
      "The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.",
      "Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.",
      "In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.",
      "The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.",
      "The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.",
      "Alien Enemies Act removals",
      "Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a \"hostile nation\" if it is engaged in an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.",
      "The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.",
      "But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.",
      "In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.",
      "The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later\u00a0sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice \u2014 24 hours \u2014 of their impending deportations.",
      "The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua \u2014 preconditions to invoking the law.",
      "The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision \"will not be the final say on the matter.\"",
      "Firings of members of independent agencies",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.",
      "In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.",
      "But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.",
      "At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a \"at least a fair prospect\" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.",
      "\"[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,\" he wrote.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.",
      "The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.",
      "Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.",
      "In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states \u2014 Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon \u2014 a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.",
      "The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to \"being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",

    "story": [
      "It was President Trump who announced that conservative commentator and activist Charlie Kirk had died after he was shot during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon. The president, who was close to Kirk, praised his appeal to young Americans and mourned him in a social media post.",
      "\"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president also ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening to honor Kirk.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump released a video statement about Kirk, blaming the \"radical left\" for his killing. \"For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,\" he said in a video posted to Truth Social. \"This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican politicians alike condemned Kirk's murder, although among some in Congress, there were disagreements about how to observe his death on the House floor. Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to hold a moment of silence for Kirk. Then, according to the House gallery, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado asked for a point of order \u2014 she reshared an X post that said she had asked for a moment of prayer. A Democrat yelled, \"No.\" Boebert and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, then started to speak out, as other lawmakers who appeared to be Democrats responded. One yelled, \"There was just a shooting in Colorado!\" Another said \"Pass some gun laws!\" Johnson repeatedly called for order.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News, Johnson explained what had happened. \"A motion was made on the floor to have a vocal prayer, and it turned into an argument,\" he said, adding, \"You know, that's where our politics are in the country right now. We have got to turn the heat down a little bit. We got to have civil discourse.\"",
      "\"The great tragic irony about this, one of the tragedies, is that Charlie represented that, the best of it,\" Johnson continued. \"He's the guy that was the champion out on the front lines having the debate, but he he loved the people that disagreed with him .... He loved it, and he loved the debate.\"",
      "\"That's what's so important for us to remember,\" Johnson said. \"We shouldn't regard one another as enemies. We're fellow Americans, and we should have vigorous debate, but it cannot lead to political violence. It's just too much.\"",
      "Vance: \"You ran a good race, my friend.   We've got it from here.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance posted a lenghty tribute to Kirk on X late Wednesday night saying Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for President Trump to pick him as his running mate last year, following what Vance described as an eight-year-long friendship with the conservative commentator.",
      "Vance tells how Kirk advised him during his 2022 Senate campaign and says that, during the 2024 run for the White House, \"Some of our most successful events were organized not by the campaign, but by TPUSA (Turning Point USA).\" Vance adds that Kirk \"didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",
      "\"Charlie Kirk was a true friend. The kind of guy you could say something to and know it would always stay with him,\" Vance writes.",
      "He concludes by saying, \"And now that Charlie is in heaven, I'll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly.   You ran a good race, my friend.   We've got it from here.\"",

      "Curtis told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on Thursday that lawmakers will likely begin \"rethinking\" their approach to security, as threats against lawmakers tick up. But he noted the issue is difficult to solve because there are 535 members of Congress, all with busy travel and public event schedules.",
      "\"The problem is, I don't see a solution,\" Curtis said. \"I don't want to say it's an occupational hazard, but in many ways, I just don't know how you solve this. And the alternative is also not acceptable, which is that we stay away from people.\"",

      "Members of Congress are curtailing outdoor events and public appearances in the wake of the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, underscoring rising anxiety over political violence on Capitol Hill.",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, is postponing a rally scheduled for Sunday in Raleigh, North Carolina, that had been planned in conjunction with the state Democratic Party, an adviser said Thursday. \"After yesterday's events, we are postponing out of an abundance of caution. We hope to hold the event at a later date,\" a senior adviser said. The North Carolina Democratic Party also confirmed the event has been postponed.",

      "Bolsonaro, who has always denied any wrongdoing, is currently under house arrest in Brasilia. He can appeal the ruling.",
      "Four of the five justices reviewing the case in the panel found the far-right politician guilty on five counts, in a ruling that will deepen political divisions and was expected to prompt a backlash from the U.S. government. It makes Bolsonaro is the first former Brazilian president to be convicted of attempting a coup.",
      "The far-right politician governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022.",

      "The sentence doesn't mean he will immediately go to prison. The court panel has now up to 60 days to publish the ruling. Once it does, Bolsonaro's lawyers have five days to file motions for clarification.  Lawyers for Bolsonaro have said they will appeal the verdict to the full Supreme Court of 11 justices.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

      "The New York Times first reported the development.",

      "When asked for a response to the Venezuelan minister, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell suggested the words of an \"illegitimate narco-terrorist regime\" should not be taken at face value. He reiterated the administration's assertion that the U.S. military would act to stop any drug traffickers in international waters or the western hemisphere.",
      "\"This strike sent a clear message: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, the United States military will use every tool at our disposal to stop you cold,\" Parnell said in a statement.",
      "The Pentagon did not respond to a question about whether the boat was turning around before it was hit.",
      "Facing questions about the legal justifications, including from lawmakers, the White House notified Congress last week that it believed the president was acting within his constitutional authority to order a strike on the boat.",
      "\"I directed these actions consistent with my responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as commander in chief and chief executive to conduct United States foreign relations,\" the Sept. 4 notification said.",
      "Mr. Trump also noted the potential for further military action.",
      "\"It is not possible at this time to know the full scope and duration of military operations that will be necessary,\" he said. \"United States forces remain postured to carry out further military operations.\"",

      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh, 59, methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Just nine weeks earlier, Mr. Trump had survived another attempt on his life while campaigning in Pennsylvania. That gunman had fired eight shots, killing an audience member and grazing Mr. Trump's ear, before being shot by a Secret Service counter sniper.",

McGee said the suspect looked at him straight in the eye. Once the suspect jumped in a car and fled, McGee said, he followed him out of a desire to help the police, not realizing that Mr. Trump was involved.",
      "Routh's cross-examination was unorthodox and brief. He asked only a few questions of the witnesses and when he did, he referred to himself in the third person, leading to some awkward exchanges with Secret Service Agent Robert Fercano, who had spotted him in the bushes.

The trial's start comes as police search for the gunman who killed conservative influencer Charlie Kirk at a campus in Utah on Wednesday in what political leaders are calling an assassination.",

    "summary": "Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on, but Republicans refused.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans moved ahead Thursday with a\u00a0change to Senate rules to make it easier to confirm President Trump's nominees amid a blockade from Democrats, who have warned against the move to go \"nuclear.\"",
      "For months, Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to slow the confirmation process, which they have taken to new extremes in recent months in protest to the president's policies. And after weeks of discussion among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune kickstarted the rule change process earlier this week, announcing a proposal to consider non-cabinet executive branch nominees in groups.",
      "\"We've got a crisis, and it's time to take steps to restore Senate precedent and codify in Senate rules what once was understood to be standard practice, and that is the Senate acting expeditiously on presidential nominations to allow a president to get his team into place,\" Thune said as he announced he would take procedural steps to change the rules.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has touted the proposal as one with \"a Democrat pedigree,\" citing a 2023 proposal to codify en bloc nominations of up to 10 nominees in Senate rules. Thune argued the GOP measure is \"not as extensive,\" noting that it applies to subcabinet level nominees and not judicial nominees. \"But the proposals share the same objective \u2014 and that is providing for confirming groups of nominees all together so the president can have its team in place and so the Senate can focus on the important legislative work in its charge.\"",
      "The majority leader filed a resolution Monday to authorize the \"en bloc,\" or all at once, consideration of 48 nominees. Heading into the day Thursday, the Senate was set to take a procedural vote on the resolution, which was expected to fall short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most measures in the upper chamber. Senate Republicans then planned to move to overrule the chair, lowering the threshold to a simple majority.",
      "But the possibility of a last-minute bipartisan deal began emerging Thursday, bringing the Senate floor to a standstill amid talks.",
      "\"It's in their court,\" Thune told reporters of a possible deal with Democrats, which he said \"basically\" resembled a proposal that Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine introduced in 2023.",
      "\"If they aren't willing to do that, then we'll proceed with the other plan,\" Thune said.",
      "Though a deal appeared within grasp early Thursday afternoon, Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on. Republicans refused, teeing up the vote that would kickstart the rule change and resuming their original plan.",
      "After a procedural vote on the resolution fell short of 60 votes, Thune made a point of order before appealed the ruling of the chair. In a 53 to 45 vote along party lines, the Senate voted to overrule the chair.",
      "Because the Senate often relies on unanimous consent to speed up floor consideration, any single senator can delay the process. And in recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, including by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has pushed back on the GOP effort, telling Senate Republicans to \"think carefully before taking this step.\"",
      "\"If you go nuclear, it's going to be a decision you will come to regret,\" Schumer said.",
      "The minority leader has repeatedly criticized the White House for walking away from a deal before the August recess involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Schumer has said Democrats were working \"in good faith with Republicans\" on a nominations package, noting that Thune was very involved and seemed willing to come to an agreement, before Mr. Trump torpedoed the talks.",
      "\"Now, rather than giving those talks another chance, Republicans would rather change how the Senate operates to weaken this chamber's traditional and powerful sense of deliberation, Schumer said. \"And if Republicans go nuclear, the historically bad nominees we've seen so far under Donald Trump will get only worse.\"",
      "With more than 1,000 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, the average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations.",
      "In 2023, Klobuchar and King introduced a proposal that would have allowed up to 10 nominees reported by the same Senate to be quickly confirmed. Senate Republicans have repeatedly cited the legislation in recent days as they pursue their rule change, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, attempted to secure passage of a similar resolution on Tuesday under unanimous consent, saying \"if Democrats were really interested in solving the problem\u2026 they wouldn't object, they would agree \u2014 it's their idea.\" But one Democrat, Sen. Alex Padilla of California, objected, suggesting the effort should take effect in the next administration.",
      "King told CBS News that his and Klobuchar's legislation was intended for future administrations, saying \"we designed that for the next president.\"",

    "summary": "California lawmakers are weighing whether to ban a group of chemicals known as PFAS, which are often called \"forever chemicals\u200b,\" in cookware.",
    "story": [
      "California lawmakers are weighing whether to ban a group of chemicals known as PFAS, which are often called \"forever chemicals,\" in cookware. The move has pulled in celebrity chefs on one side and environmentalists, including actor Mark Ruffalo, on the other.",
      "The proposal, Senate Bill 682, would prohibit PFAS in cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, ski wax, food packaging and certain children's products. The state Senate has already passed the bill and sent it to the state Assembly for consideration. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to finalize the measure and send it to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "It's the latest move to limit PFAS, which are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been around for more than 70 years and are widely used in a variety of consumer, commercial and industrial products due to their ability to withstand heat and repel water and stains. They are called \"forever chemicals\" because they are\u00a0extremely persistent in the environment\u00a0and can accumulate in humans and animals.",
      "Exposure to PFAS is linked to many negative health effects, including but not limited to kidney and testicular cancer, liver and kidney damage, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.",
      "The legislation specifically points to health risks as the reason for phasing out PFAS from cookware and other products. \"Exposure to PFAS poses a significant threat to the environment and public health,\" the bill states.",
      "Nearly everyone in the United States has been exposed to PFAS and has it in their blood, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. California and more than a dozen other states have in recent years taken a more cautionary stance by limiting PFAS in products.",
      "California has already banned PFAS in carpets, textiles and firefighting foam. Now, the latest debate centers on nonstick pans. Many are treated with a chemical compound called PTFE, a type of PFAS better known as Teflon, which coats millions of pans.",
      "Chefs push back",
      "The Cookware Sustainability Alliance, which describes itself as a group of cookware manufacturers, designers and engineers, has rallied high-profile culinary stars to oppose the bill. Chefs including Rachael Ray, Thomas Keller of the famed French Laundry restaurant in Napa, Marcus Samuelsson of Red Rooster in Harlem, and David Chang of Momofuku in New York City all submitted letters to lawmakers arguing nonstick pans are safe when manufactured and used correctly.",
      "\"I respect and share the desire to protect Californians and our planet, but I urge you to look closely at the science before moving forward with legislation that could unintentionally do more harm than good,\" Ray wrote. \"PTFEs, when manufactured and used responsibly, are proven to be safe and effective.\"",
      "Some chefs also argue that banning nonstick pans could make cooking more difficult and costly for families. \"Alternatives often do not perform with the same consistency, which can undermine the very goal of helping people cook nourishing meals at home,\" chef Einat Admony of Balaboosta in New York City wrote in her letter.",
      "\"We base everything on chemistry, on science,\" Steve Burns, executive director of the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, said in an interview with CBS News. \"The Teflon coating around a nonstick pan is a fluoropolymer. Technically it falls under the PFAS family, but fluoropolymers have been shown for decades to be inert and non-harmful.\"",
      "The cookware industry says the bill unfairly targets a material that regulators, like the Food and Drug Administration, have repeatedly approved and deemed safe. \"Since the 1960s, the FDA has authorized PTFE\u00a0and other fluoropolymers for use in food-contact applications,\" Burns said. \"As recently as early 2025, the FDA reaffirmed that PTFE in nonstick coatings remains approved.\"",
      "The environmental community responds",
      "Environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group have pushed back against the industry, saying everyday use of Teflon-coated cookware can release PFAS particles or fumes, especially when pans are scratched or overheated.",
      "\"PTFE is basically a plasticized version of PFAS,\" said Anna Reade, the NRDC's director of PFAS advocacy. She disagrees with industry claims that Teflon is safe because when nonstick cookware is overheated, she says, PFAS emissions come off the pans and can be inhaled or absorbed by the food cooking in the pan. A small scientific study supports Reade's claim.",
      "\"The other concern is that when you flake off and scrub off PTFE, you're breaking it into really small pieces,\" Reade said. Studies also suggest scratched pans may shed microplastics that could end up in food.",
      "Actor Mark Ruffalo, who starred in the 2019 film \"Dark Waters\" about PFAS contamination and is an outspoken critic of \"forever chemicals,\" weighed in on social platform X with an open letter to Ray. \"Independent science shows that the PFAS in cookware can wind up in our food,\" Ruffalo wrote. He went on to urge her to support the bill \"from the bottom of my heart.\"",
      "California state Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from Southern California who proposed the legislation, has also been vocal on social media pushing back against criticisms of the bill. \"PFAS have invaded every part of the world around us, including our very bodies and the food and water we consume,\" he told CBS News. \"SB 682 is a modest attempt to phase out more PFAS in California by focusing only on products which already face bans across the nation because safer alternatives widely exist in the marketplace.\"",
      "Allen emphasizes that the legislation aims to phase out PFAS in cookware and other items where substitutes exist. In place of nonstick cookware, stainless steel and cast-iron pans are possible replacements because they do not include Teflon coatings.",

      "Before the debate began, DeChene said the crowd was \"just having a good time\" as they enjoyed the atmosphere and chanting Kirk's name. The event at the Orem, Utah, school was part of TPUSA's \"The American Comeback Tour.\"",
      "At at a news conference on Wednesday, UVU Chief of Police Jeffrey Long said there were over 3,000 people in attendance, but there were only six university officers working the event, with some plain clothes officers in the crowd.

    "story": [
      "Three senior FBI officials who were abruptly fired last month by Kash Patel, the FBI director, are claiming in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration that they were illegally terminated at the direction of the White House for purely political reasons.",
      "The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, alleges Patel told one of the agents that his job as FBI director depended on firing agents involved in past investigations of President Trump.",
      "Patel allegedly said \"he had to fire the people his superiors told him to fire, because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"Patel explained that there was nothing [anyone] could do to stop these or any other firings, because 'the FBI tried to put the President in jail and he hasn't forgotten it,'\" the complaint claims. According to the complaint, former FBI agent Brian Driscoll indicated he believed Patel was referring to his superiors at the White House and the Justice Department which \"Patel did not deny.\"",
      "The three fired agents who brought the case were decorated veterans of the agency who had served in senior roles. One of them, Driscoll, had briefly been acting FBI director while Patel was going through the Senate confirmation process. Steven Jensen served as assistant director in charge of the Washington, D.C., field office. Spencer Evans had once led the Las Vegas field office, but by the time he was fired he had been removed from that position and was being relocated to the Huntsville, Alabama, office.",
      "The three agents, as well as two others who are not part of the lawsuit, were abruptly fired in an early August leadership purge without public comment and little explanation. None of them had reached retirement age, depriving them of their full pensions.",
      "The firings were the latest in a broad FBI makeover that began almost immediately after the transition, as the new administration sought to\u00a0 dominate an agency Mr. Trump claimed had been targeted against him.",
      "Patel defended the moves against the senior agents in an interview with Larry Kudlow on the Fox Business Network, saying the firings were aimed at \"ridding this place of its former leadership structure that did that weaponization.\"",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "The Justice Department and White House have not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Driscoll said of the lawsuit in a statement, \"I hope this effort results in protecting others who did no harm and committed no misconduct from wrongful consequences. The American people deserve an FBI made up of professionals who can serve righteously and confidently, with no fear of inappropriately applied pressure or wrongful termination.\"",
      "In his statement, Evans said the public's confidence in the FBI \"hinges on the commitment of every FBI employee, from the newest Special Agent to the Director, to relentlessly adhere to the rule of law without fear or favor.\"",
      "\"Americans should demand FBI leaders who make decisions based solely on the facts of an investigation and never on the desired outcome of one,\" Evans wrote.",
      "Jensen said in his statement that he joined the lawsuit \"to champion the values of truth and justice for those who continue to serve in the FBI.\"",
      "In filing the suit, Jensen said, \"we aim to re-establish the highest standards of justice and ensure that every American, particularly those entrusted with the immense authority of federal law enforcement, respects and obeys the law.\"",
      "Abbe David Lowell, who is representing them, said the Trump administration's termination of them was illegal.",
      "\"As the complaint makes clear, the leadership of the FBI is carrying out political orders to punish law enforcement agents for doing their jobs \u2013 it's illegal and it's putting the national security of our country at risk,\" he said. The three agents filed the case to try to vindicate their constitutional rights.",
      "The lawsuit specifically alleges that the FBI was pressured by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who wanted \"to see personnel action, like reassignment, removals and terminations at the FBI, similar to the firings and reassignments of senior attorneys at DOJ that had occurred since January 20, 2025.\"",
      "One focus of the purge involved FBI employees who were part of the Jan. 6 investigations, according to the complaint. The suit alleges that Emil Bove, who at the time was a senior top Justice Department official, told Driscoll about \"pressure he was receiving from (Stephen) Miller to conduct summary firings of agents.\"",
      "Mr. Trump later appointed Bove to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Driscoll said that when he raised concerns these actions would rattle rank-and-file agents, Bove's response took him by surprise.",
      "\"Bove stated that the creation of panic and anxiety in the workforce 'was the intent,'\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Driscoll's firing, in particular, surprised many inside the FBI because he appeared to be in good standing with Patel. A highly decorated agent who took part in numerous daring counterterrorism operations, Patel had indicated he admired him as a swashbuckling tactical operator, CBS News previously reported.",
      "During his short stint as acting director, Driscoll resisted calls from a top Trump appointee at the Justice Department to turn over the names of FBI employees who participated in the Jan. 6 investigation, earning him near folk-hero status among line agents.",
      "Patel nevertheless kept him on after he was confirmed as FBI director, putting him in charge of the most important and sensitive positions in the bureau.",
      "But his trajectory at the FBI in the wake of Trump's election reflected the chaos and partisan politics that typified the presidential transition.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Trump transition team members reached out to Driscoll about assuming a senior leadership role in an acting capacity. He soon learned it was to be acting deputy FBI director. After agreeing to be vetted for the position, according to the complaint, Driscoll was questioned by a 29-year-old transition aide who asked him a series of questions that seemed to seek information about his political loyalties.",
      "Among the questions recounted by Driscoll in the lawsuit: \"Who did you vote for?\" \"Do you agree that the FBI agents who stormed Mar-a-Lago, to include the rank-and-file, should be held accountable?\" \"What are your thoughts on DEI?\" And, \"Have you voted for a Democrat in the last five elections?\"",
      "Driscoll defended the actions of the agents in the Mar-a-Lago search \"for doing their job\" and said he \"strongly believes in diversity and a diverse workforce.\" He refused to answer the other questions, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Jensen also appeared to have Patel's backing before he was fired. A veteran agent who helped oversee the January 6 investigation from his position as chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section, Jensen was given a significant promotion by Patel, who appointed him assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, which the complaint identifies as one of the largest field offices in the country.",
      "The promotion had inflamed a noisy portion of Trump's MAGA base because of his supervisory role in the Jan. 6 case. They torched him and the decision on social media, but Patel continued to praise Jensen in meetings and even presented him with a director's \"challenge coin,\" a token of appreciation that leaders in the military and law enforcement often bestow on their subordinates.",

It should have been more than a personal decision.\"",

    "summary": "Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 e may contain an atmosphere and liquid water, NASA scientists said. Research into the exoplanet is ongoing.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are observing an Earth-like exoplanet that may contain water using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The exoplanet, known as TRAPPIST-1 e, orbits the red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The system was discovered in 2017. There are seven Earth-sized worlds orbiting the star, but planet e is the only one that is at a distance where water on the surface is \"theoretically possible,\" NASA said. However, astronomers still need to determine if the planet has an atmosphere.",
      "To look for an atmosphere, NASA scientists directed the Webb telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument at the TRAPPIST-1 system as planet e passed in front of the star. If the planet has an atmosphere, the starlight that passes through it will be partially absorbed. That will create dips in the light spectrum that reaches the spectrograph. Those dips will allow scientists to determine if the planet has an atmosphere and what chemicals it might be made of.",
      "Scientists are also studying the light spectrum of another exoplanet in the system called TRAPPIST-1 b. Researchers have determined that planet has no atmosphere, NASA said, so comparing its output to that of TRAPPIST-1 e allows for a fuller picture of the potential atmosphere on that planet.",
      "\"Webb's infrared instruments are giving us more detail than we've ever had access to before, and the initial four observations we've been able to make of planet e are showing us what we will have to work with when the rest of the information comes in,\" said N\u00e9stor Espinoza of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, a principal investigator on the research team. Espinoza and the research team recently published two\u00a0scientific\u00a0papers\u00a0outlining their initial results.",
      "Researchers \"feel confident\" that TRAPPIST-1 e does not have a primary atmosphere. A primary atmosphere would be made of hydrogen and helium that would have been present when the planet was formed. But the star the planet orbits is \"very active,\" with \"frequent flares,\" NASA said, which create stellar radiation that may have \"stripped off\" that primary atmosphere. However, TRAPPIST-1 e may have built up a \"heavier secondary atmosphere.\" Many planets, including Earth, have done this, NASA said. Further research with the Webb telescope and its instruments will determine the types of atmosphere and its makeup.",
      "There are also many possibilities for water on the planet. There may be none at all, NASA said. TRAPPIST-1 e might also contain an ocean or wide swath of water. One side of the planet is always in darkness, so there may also be ice, NASA said. If there is liquid water on the planet, the NASA researchers say there would also be a greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere stable and warm the planet.",
      "\"We are really still in the early stages of learning what kind of amazing science we can do with Webb. It's incredible to measure the details of starlight around Earth-sized planets 40 light-years away and learn what it might be like there, if life could be possible there,\" said Ana Glidden, a post-doctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who led the research on possible atmospheres for planet e, in NASA's news release. \"We're in a new age of exploration that's very exciting to be a part of,\" she said.",

      "A spokesperson for Discord later said it removed an account associated with Robinson and said the company will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement.",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination. He said the gunman is believed to have arrived on campus at 11:52 a.m. local time on Wednesday and moved through stairwells to the roof of a building near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with FBI Director Kash Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 whom Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls.",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "The fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices bulges OwO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"Hey fascist, catch!\" And a second unfired casing read, \"oh bella ciao, bella cio, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read this, you are gay.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "Cox said Friday morning that the suspect was seen on surveillance camera footage arriving on the university campus at approximately 8:29 a.m. in a gray Dodge Challenger. On Thursday, officials had said that the shooter arrived near the campus at around 11:52 a.m. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspect remained on campus the entire time.",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m, which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video \u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time\u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company discriminates against disabled passengers.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging that the ride-sharing company discriminates against passengers with disabilities.",
      "The department said Uber violated the\u00a0Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination based on disability, by routinely\u00a0refusing to serve individuals\u00a0with disabilities, charging cleaning fees because of service animal shedding, and charging cancellation fees to riders who are \"unlawfully denied service.\" Uber said in a statement that it disagrees with the DOJ's allegations.",
      "The ADA requires ride-sharing companies to allow service animals accompany people with disabilities on rides and provide rides and assistance to people with stowable wheelchairs and mobility devices, the Justice Department said.",
      "The lawsuit, reviewed by CBS News, highlighted that Uber is the largest ride-share service in the U.S., and said that \"many individuals with disabilities increasingly rely on Uber's services to meet their transportation needs\u2014including to travel to work, medical appointments, religious services, and other important places.\"",
      "The department said the company has refused to reasonably modify its policies \"to avoid discriminating against riders with disabilities\" or train drivers in ADA compliance. The issues mean \"individuals with disabilities have experienced significant delays, missed appointments, and have been left stranded in inclement weather,\" the department said.",
      "In a statement in response to the lawsuit, Uber said every driver must acknowledge and agree to the service animal policy and \"all applicable accessibility laws.\" Drivers who violate Uber policies face \"decisive action,\" including \"permanent account deactivation,\" the company said. Uber said it also invests in technology, training and dedicated reporting channels, including a 24/7 service animal denial hotline, to \"ensure riders can quickly alert us so we can investigate and address issues.\"",
      "\"Riders who use guide dogs or other assistive devices deserve a safe, respectful, and welcoming experience on Uber\u2014full stop,\" the company said. \"We have a clear zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials, and we fundamentally disagree with the DOJ's allegations.\"",
      "The Justice Department previously sued Uber for charging disabled passengers a fee when they need extra time to reach a vehicle, even when they need more time because of their disability. Uber settled the lawsuit in 2022, compensating more than 65,000 users.",
      "The new lawsuit includes allegations from over a dozen people with disabilities, including blind passengers who alleged they experienced frequent ride denials and people who use wheelchairs or mobility aids who said Uber drivers refused to assist them or stow their devices.",
      "\"Uber denies service to hundreds, and potentially even thousands, of individuals with disabilities who travel with service animals, who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices, or whose appearance or involuntary behavior because of their disabilities may offend, annoy, or inconvenience drivers,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking a court order to stop Uber from discriminating against customers with disabilities, force the company to modify its policies to comply with the ADA and train its staff and drivers on the legislation. It also demands Uber pay monetary damages to riders who have been affected and a civil penalty \"to vindicate the public's interest in eliminating disability discrimination.\"",
      "\"For too long, blind riders have suffered repeated ride denials by Uber because they are traveling with a service dog,\" said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in the news release. \"This lawsuit seeks to end this persistent discrimination and allow riders with disabilities to use Uber. We will enforce the ADA's guarantee that people with disabilities have equal opportunity and full participation in all aspects of American society, including transportation.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's tariffs are slowly rippling through the economy and starting to push up prices for some products, government data shows.",
    "story": [
      "For much of 2025, the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs defied forecasts\u00a0that the import duties would drive up inflation. But that reprieve appears to be over, with economic data this week showing the tariffs are now pushing prices higher.",
      "The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, accelerating from the previous month as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy. Heavily imported goods saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, the data show. The increase represents the fastest rate of inflation since January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "Although the tariffs were first announced in April on what Mr. Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" their implementation was largely delayed as the administration negotiated new trade deals with multiple nations over the ensuing months. That gave U.S. companies time to prepare for the new import duties, which are paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government.",
      "Facing the prospect of sharply higher tariffs, some American companies scrambled to stock up on the imported goods and parts they use in their business, postponing the need to raise customer prices. Others absorbed the levies instead of passing them along to consumers.",
      "But many companies are now pulling back from those strategies, economic data shows. According to the Federal Reserve's latest \"Beige Book\" survey, which includes responses from businesses, economists and other sources, tariff-related price hikes were visible across the U.S. in August.",
      "Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\u00a0recently told CBS News that some companies facing a hit to their profit margins have no choice but to start passing on tariff-related costs to consumers.",
      "Among the companies to say they are raising prices for some goods as tariffs take effect are\u00a0home improvement giant Home Depot, retailer Macy's and camera maker Nikon.",
      "\"The pass-through from tariffs is gradual because some businesses may have held on to a greater share of the costs and may have shared a greater burden of tariffs,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"But there is a limit to how long and how much of that they can do \u2014 so there may be more of a push to pass those costs onto consumers.\"",
      "The White House said inflation remains low and that Mr. Trump's policies are boosting the economy.",
      "\"Since President Trump took office, CPI is tracking at a 2.3% annualized rate, consistent with low and stable inflation,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Leavitt also noted that data on producer prices out this week point to a decline in wholesale inflation. \"As the Trump economic agenda continues to take effect, the trillions of dollars in private sector and foreign investments, historic tax cuts, massive deregulation and energy dominance that the president is spearheading will fuel an economic boom,\" she added.",
      "Tariff-fueled price hikes",
      "Many types of goods that rely heavily on imports saw significant price hikes last month, the latest CPI report shows.",
      "Coffee, for instance, is largely imported because there are only a handful of places in the U.S. where the beans can be grown, such as Hawaii and Puerto Rico. About 80% of unroasted coffee imports are sourced from Latin America, primarily from Brazil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Products from Brazil that are shipped to the U.S. now face a 50% tariff, according to the White House. Once those import taxes kicked in, U.S. consumers in August shelled out 21% more for beans than a year earlier, according to CPI data.",
      "Other products that are heavily imported and that, as of August, are seeing large price increases compared with a year ago include:",
      "Audio equipment: +12%\u00a0Household furniture: +10%\u00a0Bananas: +6.6%Women's dresses: +6.2%Watches: +5.6%Motor vehicle parts: +3.4%",

      "Watches: +5.6%",
      "Motor vehicle parts: +3.4%",
      "Strain on consumers",
      "Prices are edging higher as worker wages are growing more slowly, straining lower-income households.",
      "\"It's troubling that so many basic necessities now cost more. Food, gas, clothing and shelter all had big cost jumps in August,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.\u00a0 \"And this is only the beginning of the price hikes. The situation will worsen in the coming months as more costs are passed along to American consumers.\"",
      "Clara Moore, 44, a public-sector researcher who lives in Newark, New Jersey, told CBS MoneyWatch she is seeing prices \"rising all over the place.\" Her grocery bill has risen to about $250 per haul, from roughly $175 one year ago, she said.",
      "Some economists think tariffs are likely to continue pushing inflation higher throughout the rest of the year, putting more financial pressure on families. As a result, many consumers will spend with more restraint, according to Daco.",
      "\"They are more cautious when it comes to their outlays. They haven't stopped spending, but they'll be more judicious from one month to the next. They'll adjust their spending according to what they need and what's affordable,\" he said.",
      "Moore said she's had to cut back her spending on discretionary goods in order to afford the basics.",
      "\"I'm in the process of cutting out all of my streaming. I stopped ordering anything from Amazon \u2014 any impulse buying I have cut out,\" she said.",
      "Ryan Sweet, Oxford Economics' chief U.S. economist, said consumers should expect to pick up about two-thirds of the cost of new U.S. tariffs on foreign goods.",
      "\"You'll have a few of these increases spread out with each passing month, and you'll see more of the tariffs passed on to consumers,\" he said.",

He was critical to the Trump ground game effort for voter turnout and built out significant parts of the Trump campaign in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Kirk stood by the president during what could be described as his political winter, soon after he announced his second presidential campaign, when skeptics doubted he could become president again.",

      "\"For those of you that have always had the president's back throughout these last couple of years, when we were at our darkest moment four years ago, this is your victory,\" Kirk said as he opened his speech at Mr. Trump's inaugural parade.",
      "But Kirk's politics weren't without controversy. Kirk pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "After casting doubt early on about mail-in voting, Kirk pushed GOP voters to embrace the methods in 2024.",
      "He pointed to\u00a0Kari Lake's loss\u00a0in the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial race as a moment where he realized that Republicans must embrace \"Election Month,\" as he put it, not just Election Day.",
      "\"It triggered a lot of introspection on our team. And I was like, why are we not embracing, you know, this sort of methodology, we might not love it, but losing feels a lot worse,\" Kirk said. \"I think that the movement is looking at it the same.\"",

      "If you filed a claim in Facebook's $725 million privacy settlement, you could get a payment within weeks, according to the settlement's administrator.",
      "Millions of consumers who used Facebook over a 15-year period were eligible to file a claim back in 2023, with the settlement stemming from multiple lawsuits filed against the social media platform by users who claimed the company improperly shared their information with third-party sources such as advertisers and data brokers.",
      "The litigation was sparked by Facebook's privacy scandal in 2018 with Cambridge Analytica, which\u00a0scraped user data\u00a0from the site as part of an effort to profile voters. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has denied any liability or wrongdoing under the settlement.",
      "Here's what to know about the payments.",

      "When will the payment be sent?",
      "The claim administrator says the company started sending out the payments in September, and that they\u00a0 will continue to be issued over the next the 10 weeks.",

The settlement administrator adds up all the points assigned to all eligible claimants and then divides the net settlement amount by that number.",
      "Because the payments are based on the number of points assigned to each claimant, people who were on Facebook for shorter periods of time are likely to receive a lower settlement amount.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than 300 lawsuits challenging many of President Trump's second-term plans and his administration's actions have been winding through the federal courts over the past few months. But a handful now may be poised for review by the Supreme Court, or are getting close to it.",
      "The cases involve major policies enacted by Mr. Trump in the months since he returned to the White House, and several of them have already been before the high court, though during earlier stages in the proceedings.",
      "In those instances, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to grant it emergency relief, allowing it to enforce its immigration policies, in some instances, or terminate officials at independent agencies, in others.",
      "In the wake of those interim decisions, lower courts have continued to hold proceedings and issue rulings addressing the merits of the Trump administration's actions. If the Supreme Court agrees to step into these disputes, they will present the initial opportunities for the justices to address the legality of Mr. Trump's plans.",
      "\"I'm expecting this to be the term of Trump,\" Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the new Supreme Court term set to begin Oct. 6.",
      "The justices are already set to hear blockbuster cases on redistricting, campaign finance and state laws barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Many of the disputes involving Mr. Trump's actions test the limits of the president's power, and rulings could have massive implications for his policies on the economy and immigration, as well as his reshaping of the executive branch.",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court roughly two dozen times so far, and it has fared well in its bids to continue enforcing its plans while legal challenges continue.",
      "But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen. Still, in some instances \u2014 like his efforts to fire certain executive officers \u2014 the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,\" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a \"huge sweeping victory\" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.",
      "Tariffs",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.",
      "The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.",
      "The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.",
      "The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.",
      "The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.",
      "Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.",
      "In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.",
      "The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.",
      "The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.",
      "Alien Enemies Act removals",
      "Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a \"hostile nation\" if it is engaged in an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.",
      "The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.",
      "But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.",
      "In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.",
      "The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later\u00a0sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice \u2014 24 hours \u2014 of their impending deportations.",
      "The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua \u2014 preconditions to invoking the law.",
      "The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision \"will not be the final say on the matter.\"",
      "Firings of members of independent agencies",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.",
      "In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.",
      "But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.",
      "At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a \"at least a fair prospect\" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.",
      "\"[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,\" he wrote.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.",
      "The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.",
      "Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.",
      "In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states \u2014 Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon \u2014 a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.",
      "The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to \"being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",

    "story": [
      "It was President Trump who announced that conservative commentator and activist Charlie Kirk had died after he was shot during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon. The president, who was close to Kirk, praised his appeal to young Americans and mourned him in a social media post.",
      "\"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president also ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening to honor Kirk.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump released a video statement about Kirk, blaming the \"radical left\" for his killing. \"For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,\" he said in a video posted to Truth Social. \"This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican politicians alike condemned Kirk's murder, although among some in Congress, there were disagreements about how to observe his death on the House floor. Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to hold a moment of silence for Kirk. Then, according to the House gallery, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado asked for a point of order \u2014 she reshared an X post that said she had asked for a moment of prayer. A Democrat yelled, \"No.\" Boebert and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, then started to speak out, as other lawmakers who appeared to be Democrats responded. One yelled, \"There was just a shooting in Colorado!\" Another said \"Pass some gun laws!\" Johnson repeatedly called for order.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News, Johnson explained what had happened. \"A motion was made on the floor to have a vocal prayer, and it turned into an argument,\" he said, adding, \"You know, that's where our politics are in the country right now. We have got to turn the heat down a little bit. We got to have civil discourse.\"",
      "\"The great tragic irony about this, one of the tragedies, is that Charlie represented that, the best of it,\" Johnson continued. \"He's the guy that was the champion out on the front lines having the debate, but he he loved the people that disagreed with him .... He loved it, and he loved the debate.\"",
      "\"That's what's so important for us to remember,\" Johnson said. \"We shouldn't regard one another as enemies. We're fellow Americans, and we should have vigorous debate, but it cannot lead to political violence. It's just too much.\"",

    "summary": "Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on, but Republicans refused.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans moved ahead Thursday with a\u00a0change to Senate rules to make it easier to confirm President Trump's nominees amid a blockade from Democrats, who have warned against the move to go \"nuclear.\"",
      "For months, Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to slow the confirmation process, which they have taken to new extremes in recent months in protest to the president's policies. And after weeks of discussion among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune kickstarted the rule change process earlier this week, announcing a proposal to consider non-cabinet executive branch nominees in groups.",
      "\"We've got a crisis, and it's time to take steps to restore Senate precedent and codify in Senate rules what once was understood to be standard practice, and that is the Senate acting expeditiously on presidential nominations to allow a president to get his team into place,\" Thune said as he announced he would take procedural steps to change the rules.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has touted the proposal as one with \"a Democrat pedigree,\" citing a 2023 proposal to codify en bloc nominations of up to 10 nominees in Senate rules. Thune argued the GOP measure is \"not as extensive,\" noting that it applies to subcabinet level nominees and not judicial nominees. \"But the proposals share the same objective \u2014 and that is providing for confirming groups of nominees all together so the president can have its team in place and so the Senate can focus on the important legislative work in its charge.\"",
      "The majority leader filed a resolution Monday to authorize the \"en bloc,\" or all at once, consideration of 48 nominees. Heading into the day Thursday, the Senate was set to take a procedural vote on the resolution, which was expected to fall short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most measures in the upper chamber. Senate Republicans then planned to move to overrule the chair, lowering the threshold to a simple majority.",
      "But the possibility of a last-minute bipartisan deal began emerging Thursday, bringing the Senate floor to a standstill amid talks.",
      "\"It's in their court,\" Thune told reporters of a possible deal with Democrats, which he said \"basically\" resembled a proposal that Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine introduced in 2023.",
      "\"If they aren't willing to do that, then we'll proceed with the other plan,\" Thune said.",
      "Though a deal appeared within grasp early Thursday afternoon, Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on. Republicans refused, teeing up the vote that would kickstart the rule change and resuming their original plan.",
      "After a procedural vote on the resolution fell short of 60 votes, Thune made a point of order before appealed the ruling of the chair. In a 53 to 45 vote along party lines, the Senate voted to overrule the chair.",
      "Because the Senate often relies on unanimous consent to speed up floor consideration, any single senator can delay the process. And in recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, including by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has pushed back on the GOP effort, telling Senate Republicans to \"think carefully before taking this step.\"",
      "\"If you go nuclear, it's going to be a decision you will come to regret,\" Schumer said.",
      "The minority leader has repeatedly criticized the White House for walking away from a deal before the August recess involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Schumer has said Democrats were working \"in good faith with Republicans\" on a nominations package, noting that Thune was very involved and seemed willing to come to an agreement, before Mr. Trump torpedoed the talks.",
      "\"Now, rather than giving those talks another chance, Republicans would rather change how the Senate operates to weaken this chamber's traditional and powerful sense of deliberation, Schumer said. \"And if Republicans go nuclear, the historically bad nominees we've seen so far under Donald Trump will get only worse.\"",
      "With more than 1,000 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, the average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations.",
      "In 2023, Klobuchar and King introduced a proposal that would have allowed up to 10 nominees reported by the same Senate to be quickly confirmed. Senate Republicans have repeatedly cited the legislation in recent days as they pursue their rule change, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, attempted to secure passage of a similar resolution on Tuesday under unanimous consent, saying \"if Democrats were really interested in solving the problem\u2026 they wouldn't object, they would agree \u2014 it's their idea.\" But one Democrat, Sen. Alex Padilla of California, objected, suggesting the effort should take effect in the next administration.",
      "King told CBS News that his and Klobuchar's legislation was intended for future administrations, saying \"we designed that for the next president.\"",
      "\"That would take it out of the politics of the moment,\" King said. \"Now, all of a sudden, they're dusting it off for use today.\"",

      "Qatar's government has condemned Israel's Tuesday strikes, saying the \"criminal attack constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms, and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of the State of Qatar and its people.\"",
      "The U.S. has relied on Qatar to act as a go-between with Hamas, with which it has long had ties. Working through Hamas' political office in Doha, both the Trump administration and the Biden administration before that have pushed hard, along with Egypt, to broker a ceasefire in the nearly two-year\u00a0war between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Palestinian group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Senior Israeli officials have also traveled to Qatar many times to take part in these negotiations since the war began.",

      "\"This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,\" Mr. Trump said in his social media post. \"Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals.\"",
      "He called \"eliminating\" Hamas \"a worthy goal,\" but added that he had spoken with both Netanyahu and leaders in Qatar, and had assured the prime minister in Doha, \"that such a thing will not happen again on their soil.\"",

      "\"I say to Qatar and all nations who harbor terrorists, you either expel them or you bring them to justice,\" Netanyahu said Wednesday. \"Because if you don't, we will.\"",
      "Netanyahu drew a parallel between Israel's attack in Doha and the U.S. invasion of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.",
      "\"We went after the terrorist masterminds who committed the October 7th massacre. And we did so in Qatar, which gives safe haven, it harbors terrorists, it finances Hamas,\" Netanyahu said.",

      "Qatar's prime minister said Netanyahu had \"killed any hope\" of returning the remaining 48 Israeli hostages held by Hamas, 20 of whom are believed to be alive in Gaza.",
      "Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said, before appearing Thursday at the United Nations, that Israel's attack had inflamed anti-Israeli sentiments among many Arab nations in the Middle East, telling CNN: \"I think that what Netanyahu has done yesterday (Tuesday), he just killed any hope for those hostages.\"",
      "Al Thani spoke as thousands of Palestinians continued to flee Gaza City ahead of Israel's ongoing offensive there. The numbers leaving the city have grown in recent days, though many have not heeded Israel's orders to leave because they say they no longer have the strength or money to relocate.",
      "The Israeli military's plans for the next phases of its operation in what it calls Hamas' last remaining stronghold are aimed at taking over the largest Palestinian city, which is already devastated from earlier raids and is now experiencing famine, according to the world's leading expert body on food crises.",
      "The plans have drawn widespread condemnation and added to Israel's global isolation, which intensified further this week following the strike on Qatar.",
      "Al Thani was expected to attend a U.N. Security Council meeting later Thursday, part of a diplomatic push by Qatar after the strike. The Foreign Ministry in Doha also said Thursday that it was convening an emergency Arab-Islamic leaders summit next week in Qatar to discuss the attack.",

    "summary": "South Africa's racist apartheid regime said no one was to blame for activist Steve Biko's death in prison. 48 years later, his family wants the truth to come out.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0South African activist and anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko died almost five decades ago at the age of 30 in police custody. Family members and others who saw his body that day said he was tortured and killed by South African police, and that he had not died from the effects of a hunger strike, as officers claimed at the time.",
      "Prosecutors announced on Friday that they would be reopening a formal inquest into Biko's death, exactly 48 years to the day after he died.",
      "Biko, a liberation leader who founded and led South Africa's Black Consciousness Movement, became one of the most globally recognized victims of the apartheid era following his 1977 death in a prison cell.",
      "The country's National Prosecuting Authority, in a landmark decision, confirmed it would reopen an inquest to allow judges to rule on whether an offense had been committed.",
      "Nobody has ever been held to account for Biko's death, and several police officers requested, but did not receive, amnesty for their alleged involvement during the hearings of South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).",
      "Biko was arrested at a roadblock in what was then called Grahamstown, now Makhanda, in August 1977. He was accused of violating a so-called \"banning order,\" a measure in the apartheid-era's racial segregation laws that allowed authorities to restrict the movement of individuals deemed a threat.",
      "Twenty days after his arrest he was driven over 600 miles, naked, with his legs in shackles in the back of a police vehicle, to Pretoria. He died in prison the day after arriving.",
      "According to reports from family members and others who saw his body soon after he died, Biko was brutally tortured by apartheid regime police during his incarceration and eventually died of a brain hemorrhage.",
      "The only government inquest into Biko's death was carried out in 1977, decades before the end of apartheid rule, and a judge came to the conclusion that no one was to blame.",
      "But his death was met by an international outcry, and calls for sanctions against the apartheid government and its leaders helped fuel the global movement against the racist regime.",
      "Biko's life was immortalized in music by Peter Gabriel's \"Biko,\" just three years after his death, and then again by reggae dancehall artist Beenie Man's \"Steve Biko\" in 1997. Denzel Washington played the anti-apartheid icon in the 1987 Hollywood movie \"Cry Freedom.\"",
      "Five former police officers from the South African regime's feared Special Branch testified at the TRC that Biko had attacked one of their colleagues with a chair, and that during an ensuing scuffle to restrain him, he hit his head against the wall, causing his death.",
      "They admitted under cross-examination, however, that they had colluded and submitted false affidavits during the initial 1977 investigation.",
      "\"My dad was a very healthy man, and we know he died of a severe brain hemorrhage,\" Biko's son Nkosinathi Biko said in an interview this week with the broadcaster Newzroom Africa. \"During the TRC process it was clear under intense cross-examination that one of the men admitted that they grabbed his head and rammed it into the wall which caused his death. They were denied amnesty at the TRC because of course they lied.\"",
      "The TRC, which conducted its work between 1996 and 2001, recommended more than 300 cases for prosecution by the National Prosecuting Authority. To date, no one has been prosecuted for those alleged apartheid-era offenses, however, leaving many families, including Biko's, frustrated.",
      "\"It's very clear that the history books of this country need to be corrected,\" Nkosinathi Biko said in the interview. \"The body of my father is a living testament to his last minutes and the torture and violence that was visited upon him. We should by now have dealt with these matters 30 years into our democracy, and it should have been handled better.\"",
      "In April, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered an inquiry into whether previous governments had intentionally blocked investigations and prosecutions of apartheid-era crimes.",
      "The National Prosecuting Authority has been under pressure to bring formal charges for apartheid-era crimes allegedly committed by individuals who did not receive amnesty through the TRC process, as well as to bring accountability and answers to unresolved cases of gross human rights violations during the apartheid regime.",
      "Nkosinathi Biko said his father's legacy was about giving and investing in a shared society, and he said setting the record straight was a vital step forward for the nation.",
      "\"I think that our sense of triumph, our sense of healing, rests in the prosecution, which is necessary in the inquests,\" he said. \"But it also rests in ensuring that we correct the history of this country and we accentuate the value of human life and human dignity.\"",

      "The conviction, he added, is \"very bad for Brazil.\"",
      "And later, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on his X account that the Trump administration \"will respond accordingly to this witch hunt.\"",
      "The sentence doesn't mean he will immediately go to prison. The court panel has now up to 60 days to publish the ruling. Once it does, Bolsonaro's lawyers have five days to file motions for clarification.  Lawyers for Bolsonaro have said they will appeal the verdict to the full Supreme Court of 11 justices.",
      "Bolsonaro has not attended the court proceedings, and on Thursday morning he was seen at his house's garage but didn't speak to reporters.",
      "Justice C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia Thursday said she was convinced by the evidence the Attorney General's Office presented against the former president.",
      "\"He is the instigator, the leader of an organization that orchestrated every possible move to maintain or seize power,\" she said.",
      "On Wednesday, Justice Luiz Fux disagreed and voted to acquit the ex-president of all charges.",
      "The trial has been followed by a divided society, with people backing the process against the former president, while others still support him. Some have taken to the streets to back the far-right leader who contends he is being politically persecuted.",
      "Bolsonaro's trial got renewed attention after Mr. Trump linked a 50% tariff on imported Brazilian goods to his ally's legal situation, calling it a \" witch hunt.\" Observers say the U.S. might announce new sanctions against Brazil after the trial, further straining their fragile diplomatic relations.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, said Tuesday that Bolsonaro was the leader of a coup plot and of a criminal organization, and voted in favor of convicting him.",
      "Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the former president's sons, on Thursday talk about his father on his social media platforms. But instead of mentioning his father's conviction, he pushed for his amnesty, which he is seeking through Congress.",
      "\"It is time to do nothing less than what is correct, just,\" he said.",
      "Fux, in his dissenting opinion on Wednesday, disagreed with de Moraes and the other two justices.",
      "\"No one can be punished for cogitation,\" Fux said. \"A coup d'\u00e9tat does not result from isolated acts or individual demonstrations lacking coordination, but rather from the actions of organized groups, equipped with resources and strategic capacity to confront and replace the incumbent power.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, L\u00facia also voted to convict Bolsonaro of organized crime in connection with the alleged coup attempt.",
      "L\u00facia allowed de Moraes to interrupt her vote and play several videos that showed Bolsonaro in front of thousands of supporters between 2021 and 2023 urging him to leave the Supreme Court. De Moraes also showed footage of some destruction inside the court's headquarters after the riots on Jan. 8, 2023.",
      "Bolsonaro faced accusations he attempted to illegally hang onto power after his 2022 electoral defeat to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.",
      "Prosecutors charged Bolsonaro with counts including attempting to stage a coup, being part of an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, as well as being implicated in violence and posing a serious threat to the state's assets and listed heritage.",
      "\"Bolsonaro attempted a coup in this country, and there is hundreds of pieces of evidence,\" Lula said early Thursday in an interview with local TV Band, ahead of the trial.",
      "Despite his legal woes, Bolsonaro remains a powerful political player in Brazil.",
      "The far-right politician had been previously banned from running for office until 2030 in a separate case. He is expected to choose an heir who is likely to challenge Lula next year.",
      "The ruling may push Bolsonaro's allied lawmakers to seek some amnesty for him through Congress.",
      "The embattled former leader could now faced increased pressure to pick a political heir to likely challenge Lula in the general elections next year.",

    "story": [
      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were released from a detention center early Thursday and boarded a charter flight back to their country.",
      "The flight, which departed Atlanta, is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News photographer Darrall Johnson watched as the Koreans boarded eight buses that then left for the airport, where a Korean Air charter flight was waiting to fly them home. Johnson said a cart full of documents was loaded onto one of the buses.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in an address delivered Thursday in Seoul, said 316 South Koreans would be on the flight, including 10 women. He said one South Korean had decided to remain in the U.S. as they have family members in the country.   The Foreign Ministry said there were also 14 non-Korean nationals boarding the plane, three Japanese, 10 Chinese and one Indonesian.",
      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",
      "The detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",

But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",

      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",

      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",

      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",
      "Rubio, during his meeting Wednesday in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho, \"said the United States welcomes ROK (South Korea) investment into the United States and stated his interest in deepening cooperation on this front,\" according to a readout shared by the State Department, which did not mention the ICE raid in Georgia.",
      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",
      "The ministry's statement said Cho had \"strongly requested the U.S. administration's special attention and support to ensure that these workers, who are not criminals, can quickly depart the US without physical restraint, such as handcuffs, and that they will not face any disadvantages in future visits to the U.S. He also proposed the establishment of a working group between the U.S. and South Korea to discuss various measures, including the creation of new visa categories, to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official's August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws - which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\" but he didn't elaborate.",
      "Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand's government hasn't disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers, at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Interviewed at his sprawling home by 60 Minutes in 2014, Dotcom told correspondent Bob Simon that he was inspired to seek his riches by the James Bond movies, \"where, you know, some characters had private islands and super tankers converted into yachts and space stations and underwater homes. So, you know, I got inspired by that.\"",
      "\"But you're not playing James Bond, you're playing Dr. No,\" suggested Simon.",
      "\"That's what everybody says,\" replied the web entrepreneur.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand's Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",
      "Under New Zealand law, it remained up to the country's justice minister to decide if the extradition should proceed. The minister, Paul Goldsmith, ruled in August 2024 that it should. \u00a0 \u00a0  But by then, Dotcom was the only person whose fate remained in question. Two of his former business partners, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk, pleaded guilty to charges against them in a New Zealand court in June 2023 and were sentenced to two and a half years in jail.",
      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him, too.",
      "Grice rejected that, saying the choice to only charge Ortmann and van der Kolk in New Zealand was \"a proper exercise of the Police's discretion.\" The jurist also dismissed Dotcom's claim that Goldsmith's extradition decision was politically motivated.",
      "Prosecutors earlier abandoned their extradition bid against a fourth Megaupload officer, Finn Batato, who was arrested in New Zealand. Batato returned to Germany, where he died from cancer in 2022.",
      "In November 2024, Dotcom said in a post on X that he had suffered a stroke. He wrote on X in July that he was making \"good progress\" in his recovery but still suffered from speech and memory impairments.",
      "Goldsmith's decision that Dotcom should be extradited was made before the stroke. But Grice said the minister had considered other \"significant health conditions\" Dotcom faced and wasn't wrong to conclude that these shouldn't prevent him from being deported.",

    "summary": "An activist group says two of its boats taking part in a flotilla trying to reach war-torn Gaza were attacked by drones in two days.",
    "story": [
      "An activist group sending a flotilla of aid boats to try to reach Gaza \u2014 the Global Sumud Flotilla \u2014 said a second one of its vessels was attacked by a drone while docked in Tunisia one day after it reported a similar strike.",
      "\"The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) confirms that on September 9, another boat in our fleet \u2014   the 'Alma' \u2014   was attacked by a drone as it was docked in Tunisian waters,\" the group said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The boat, sailing under the British flag, sustained fire damage on its top deck. The fire has since been extinguished, and all passengers and crew are safe. An investigation is currently underway and when more information is available it will be released immediately.\"",
      "The group shared a video clip that it said showed the moment of the second attack. The video appeared to show a fireball hitting the deck of the boat from above.",
      "A day earlier, GSF shared a security camera video that appeared to show the first drone strike on another one of its vessels.",
      "\"This marks the second such attack in two days. These repeat attacks come during intensified Israeli aggression on Palestinians in Gaza, and are an orchestrated attempt to distract and derail our mission. The Global Sumud Flotilla continues undeterred. Our peaceful voyage to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza and stand in unwavering solidarity with its people presses forward with determination and resolve,\" the group said.",
      "Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who took part in a separate Gaza flotilla that was\u00a0stopped by Israeli forces\u00a0earlier this year, is among those traveling with the GSF flotilla.",
      "After the first alleged attack, Tunisian officials initially dismissed the allegations. GSF later said Tunisia was investigating.",
      "Tunisia's Ministry of the Interior said in a statement on Wednesday that it was in fact investigating the incidents, and that it considered the second one a deliberate attack.",
      "\"The attack which took place yesterday on one of the ships docked at the Port of Sidi Bou Said was a deliberate act,\" the ministry said. \"The Ministry's departments are conducting all necessary investigations and inquiries to uncover the full facts, so that public opinion \u2014 not only in Tunisia but also worldwide \u2014 will be informed about who planned this attack, who colluded in it, and who carried out its execution.\"",
      "Israel maintains a blockade of Gaza, including its maritime border in the Mediterranean, so the flotilla would not have permission to dock there.",
      "Israeli forces have previously boarded and seized vessels taking part in activist flotillas to prevent them from breaching its blockade, including in a raid on a boat in 2010 that left at least nine activists dead.",
      "Israel has dismissed the flotillas as publicity stunts, and says its maritime blockade is necessary to prevent weapons and other materials being smuggled into the war-torn Palestinian territory, which has long been ruled by the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas.",

    "story": [
      "British Prime Minster Keir Starmer has fired his ambassador to the United States, long-time Labour Party politician Peter Mandelson, after days of revelations about Mandelson's years-long friendship with the late financier and convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In light of the additional information in emails written by Peter Mandelson, the Prime Minister has asked the Foreign Secretary to withdraw him as Ambassador,\" the British government said in a statement released Thursday. \"The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment. In particular Peter Mandelson's suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein's first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information. In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein's crimes he has been withdrawn as Ambassador with immediate effect.\"",
      "Pressure began mounting on the U.K. government to take action when messages written by Mandelson,were released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this month as part of a redacted 2003 \"birthday book\" for Epstein.",
      "They included a series of short notes accompanied by photos.",
      "\"Once upon a time, an intelligent, sharp-witted man they call 'mysterious' parachuted into my life,\" Mandelson wrote. \"You would spend many hours just waiting for him to turn up\u2026 and often, no sooner were you getting used to having him around, you would suddenly be alone... again\u2026\"",
      "With a photo of Mandelson setting a table alongside two women, whose faces were obscured, he wrote: \"Leaving you with some 'interesting' friends to entertain instead.\"",
      "Mandleson wrote that Epstein was known for \"taking you by surprise... in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum),\" and that \"whenever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the existence of Epstein's \"birthday book\" in July, prompting President Trump, who is also alleged to have written a message for Epstein in the book, to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and the owner of its parent company, Rupert Murdoch, seeking $10 billion in damages. Mr. Trump denies he wrote the message.",
      "Epstein was first criminally indicted in 2006 on state felony charges of solicitation of prostitution in Florida, three years after the book was written.",
      "Last week, when questioned about Mandelson's \"birthday book\" message, Prime Minister Starmer said Mandelson had \"repeatedly expressed his deep regret\" for his relationship with Epstein and \"he is right to do so. I have confidence in him, and he is playing an important role in the UK-US relationship.\"",
      "New revelations about Mandelson's communications with Epstein",
      "On Wednesday, Bloomberg published a report based on 100 emails sent between Mandelson and Epstein between 2005 and\u00a0 2010.",
      "In those emails, which CBS News has not been able to verify itself, Epstein and Mandelson discussed his legal cases, and Mandelson expressed support for Epstein, offering to raise his situation with at least one of his contacts and encouraging Epstein to fight back using strategies from Sun Tzu's \"Art of War.\"",
      "In one email from 2008, published by Bloomberg, Mandelson wrote: \"You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can. The whole thing has been years of torture and now you have to show the world how big a person you are, and how strong.\"",
      "In a podcast interview published Wednesday, Mandelson expressed his regret over his relationship with Epstein.",
      "\"I regret very much that I fell for his lies. I fell and accepted assurances that he had given me about his indictment, his original criminal case in Florida, like very many people, I took at face value what he said. With hindsight, with fresh information many years later, we realized that we had been wrong to believe him \u2014  he's a charismatic, criminal liar, we now see \u2014 and I regret very much indeed\u2026 I felt it like an albatross around my neck since his death,\" Mandelson said.",
      "Mandelson said he had never witnessed Epstein committing any crimes.",
      "\"During all the time I was an associate of his, I never saw the wrongdoing. I never saw any evidence of criminal activity. I never sought and nor did he offer any introductions to women in the way that he allegedly did for others. Perhaps it's because I'm a gay man. Perhaps when I knew him all those years ago\u2026When I was associated with him all those years ago, as I did with my then partner and now husband Reinaldo, we never, ever saw any evidence or sign of this activity which has since come to light,\" Mandelson said. \"That's why I feel so profoundly upset by what has now been revealed about what he did to women and why I feel profoundly upset that I was taken in by him and continued my association with him for far longer than I should have done.\"",
      "The now-former British ambassador said during his interview for the podcast that he expected his correspondence with Epstein to be made public.",
      "\"I have no doubt at all that there's a lot of traffic, correspondence, exchanges between us, absolutely, and we know those are going to surface, we know they're going to come out, we know they're going to be very embarrassing, and I know that I'm going profoundly to regret ever having met him and being introduced to him in the first place,\" Mandelson said. \"But I can't rewrite history. What I can do is express my profound sympathy for those who were badly treated by him and secondly I can accept, yes I can accept, that I continued my association with him for too long.\"",

      "Harry has said previously that he wants to rebuild his relationship with his family, which has been strained since he and his wife Meghan formally stepped down from their roles as working royals and moved to California.",
      "This meeting was at Buckingham Palace, the monarch's official residence in London. CBS News has been told they met privately, for tea, but that all other details of the encounter were private.",
      "Speaking to reporters at an event later, Prince Harry said only that his father was \"doing great\" amid his ongoing treatment for an unspecified form of cancer.",

      "Absent on this trip were Harry's wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their children, Archie and Lilibet.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' partner network BBC News in May, Harry said he couldn't envision bringing them all back to the U.K. with him since he has lost a legal bid to have his downgraded state security detail restored.",

So, there's been no contact,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News on Tuesday. \"There's no chance that William and Harry are going to meet up anytime soon...

      "\"Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones,\" Prime Minister Donald\u00a0Tusk said in a social media post. \"Those drones that posed  a direct threat were shot down. I am in constant communication with the Secretary General of NATO and our allies.\"",
      "Poland's military said it scrambled aircraft to shoot down \"hostile objects\" in Polish airspace, a first for a NATO country during the war. The military, in\u00a0a post on X, called it \"an unprecedented violation of Polish airspace by drone-type objects\" and an \"act of aggression that posed a real threat to the safety of our citizens.\"",
      "The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said early indications suggested the Russian drone incursion into Poland's airspace was intentional.",
      "\"Last night in Poland we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental,\" Kallas said in a statement. \"The EU stands in full solidarity with Poland. Russia's war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost to Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europe's defense.\"",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said its drones had not targeted Poland, but Moscow's close ally, Belarus, said it tracked some drones that \"lost their course\" after being jammed, according to The Associated Press. Polish officials have said some of the drones were launched from Belarus, which Russian forces have used as a base for both ground and aerial attacks on Ukraine throughout the war.",
      "In a statement posted on social media, a NATO spokesperson said fighter jets from the Netherlands were deployed and helped to shoot down the drones, confirming it was \"the first time NATO aircrafts have engaged potential threats in Allied airspace.\"",
      "In addition to the direct response by Polish and Dutch fighter jets, German Patriot missiles based in Poland \"were placed on alert,\" and an Italian airborne early warning aircraft and a NATO refueler aircraft were also launched, according to the statement from NATO spokesperson, Col. Martin L. O'Donnell.",
      "\"NATO responded quickly and decisively to the situation, demonstrating our capability and resolve to defend Allied territory,\" Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, NATO's commander for Europe, said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "\"My thanks and congratulations to the Polish Operational Command and our NATO pilots for shooting down Russian drones over Poland,\" Poland's Prime Minister\u00a0Tusk said in a later social media post. \"Actions speak louder than words.\"",
      "\"We stand by our NATO Allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said Wednesday in a social media post, in the first reaction from a senior American official to the Russian incursion into Poland's airspace.",
      "A White House official later told CBS News that President Trump was tracking the reports out of Poland, and there were plans for him to speak with the country's newly-elected President Karol Nawrocki later in the day. Mr. Trump then issued his own brief reaction to the incident, saying on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "Apparent Russian drones and missiles have entered the airspace of NATO members previously, including Poland's, several times during\u00a0Russia's three-and-a-half-year war, but no NATO country had ever tried to shoot them down.",
      "A cornerstone of the Western NATO military alliance is the principle that an attack on any member is considered an attack on all. A NATO source told the Reuters news agency that the alliance wasn't treating the Russian drone incursion into Polish territory as an attack, but that it did appear to have been deliberate.",
      "Tusk told Poland's parliament that authorities had identified 19 violations of the country's airspace overnight and shot down at least three drones, adding that no one was harmed in the \"Russian action.\"",
      "Tusk said Poland had made a \"formal request to invoke Article 4\" of the NATO alliance's founding treaty. Under Article 4, any member can call urgent talks when it feels its \"territorial integrity, political independence or security\" are at risk.",
      "The Polish case marked the eighth time the article has been invoked since the alliance was founded in 1949, and the third time Article 4 has been invoked to address Russia's incursions into and invasion of Ukraine.",
      "NATO's collective security is based on its Article 5 principle, which states that if one member is attacked, the entire alliance will come to its defense. That article has only been invoked once in the history of NATO, by the United States, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "Poland's military said efforts were \"underway to search for and locate the possible crash sites of these objects\" and \"the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces is monitoring the current situation, and Polish and allied forces and assets remain fully prepared for further actions.\"",
      "Polish police said officers had discovered a damaged drone in the eastern Polish village of Czosnowka, according to Reuters, and there were reports that a building was damaged by a falling drone or debris in another eastern Polish town, but there were no reports of any injuries.",
      "Hours later, Poland's military said on X that the operations had concluded but the search for downed drones was continuing. \"We urge that in the event of observing an unknown object or its debris, do not approach, touch, or move it. Such elements may pose a threat and contain hazardous materials. They must be thoroughly inspected by the appropriate services,\" the military cautioned.",
      "The Polish government announced it would hold an \"extraordinary\" meeting Wednesday morning.",
      "The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles from the Polish border.",
      "Warnings of further Russian aggression",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that eight Russian drones were \"aimed toward\" Poland in an overnight barrage that forced Warsaw to scramble air defenses. \"It was not just one Shahed that could be called an accident, but at least eight strike drones aimed toward Poland,\" Zelensky said, referring to Iranian-designed drones deployed by Moscow, adding that the incident represented \"An extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.\"",
      "Ukraine's foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga,\u00a0warned on X that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The longer he faces no strength in response, the more aggressive he gets. A weak response now will provoke Russia even more - and then Russian missiles and drones will fly even further into Europe.\"",
      "Poland's President Nawrocki issued a warning along the same lines Tuesday, saying at a news conference in Helsinki that, \"We do not trust Vladimir Putin's good intentions. We believe that Vladimir Putin is ready to also invade other countries.\"",
      "European Union chief Ursula said Moscow had carried out a \"reckless and unprecedented\" violation of Polish airspace.",
      "And the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, posted on X Wednesday that \"we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental. The EU stands in full solidarity with Poland. Russia's war is escalating, not ending.\"",
      "NATO-member Poland, a major supporter of Ukraine, hosts over a million Ukrainian refugees and is a key transit point for Western humanitarian and military aid to the war-torn country.",
      "Last month, Warsaw said a Russian military drone flew into its airspace and exploded in farmland in eastern Poland and depicted the incident as a \"provocation.\" In 2023, Poland said a Russian missile had crossed into its airspace to strike Ukraine. And in November 2022, two civilians were killed when a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile fell on a village near the border.",

      "The summer and fall months often see menacing storms roaring through the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 with the Atlantic hurricane season starting on June 1 and continuing through Nov. 30. Historically, on average, hurricane and tropical storm activity peaks on Sept. 10.",
      "But this year has been quieter than expected when it comes to tropical systems in the Atlantic, making some wonder: Where are all the hurricanes?",
      "Looking at the Atlantic Ocean Basin, most tropical waves that eventually strengthen into tropical systems come off of the coast of Africa and travel across the warm ocean waters. But this year,\u00a0Saharan dust has continued to move over the open waters, preventing the thunderstorm development that is needed to form a tropical cyclone.",
      "Dust from Africa typically moves across the Atlantic every year, usually peaking from late June to the middle of August. However, high pressure in place over the North-Central Atlantic is allowing for fewer storms to develop in Northern Africa which creates the perfect conditions for dry dust to move through.",
      "The planet is also in a cycle of what is known as \"ENSO Neutral,\" which means that neither El Nino nor La Nina are present. During El Nino, the winds near the equator weaken which allows warmer water to be pushed eastward. La Nina has the opposite effect of El Nino. During La Nina events, winds around the equator are stronger than usual, bringing colder water eastward.",
      "When La Nina is present, fewer Eastern Pacific hurricanes occur and more Atlantic hurricanes form, and vice versa for El Nino periods. Since neither is currently present, we do not have a typical hurricane season.",

      "Seoul\u00a0\u2014 A South Korean court acquitted on Wednesday a woman convicted six decades ago for defending herself against sexual violence, after she was inspired by the country's #MeToo movement to challenge the ruling.",
      "Choi Mal-ja was 19 in 1964 when she was attacked by a 21-year-old man in the southern town of Gimhae. He pinned her to the ground and repeatedly forced his tongue into her mouth, at one point blocking her nose to stop her from breathing, according to court records.",
      "Choi managed to break free by biting off about half of an inch of his tongue.",
      "In one of South Korea's most contentious rulings on sexual violence, the aggressor received only six months in prison, suspended for two years, for trespassing and intimidation \u2014 but not attempted rape.",
      "But Choi, now 79, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and handed a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.",
      "That decision was overturned Wednesday by the Busan District Court, which ruled that her actions \"constitute justifiable self-defense\" under South Korean law.",
      "Choi's actions at the time are now \"deemed an attempt to escape an unjust infringement on her bodily integrity and sexual self-determination,\" the court said in a statement sent to AFP.",
      "The ruling overturns Choi's 1965 conviction, when the court found her actions had \"exceeded the reasonable bounds of legally permissible self-defense.\"",
      "Wearing a bright pink blazer, Choi beamed as supporters handed her multiple bouquets after the ruling. Women's rights activists and her supporters celebrated, many visibly emotional, waving a placard that read, \"Choi Mal-ja did it!\"",
      "\"Sixty-one years ago, in a situation where I could understand nothing, the victim became the perpetrator, and my fate was sealed as a criminal,\" Choi said at a news conference following the ruling. \"For the victims who shared the same fate as mine, I wanted to be a source of hope for them.\"",
      "Choi's appeal gained momentum after the #MeToo movement, \u00a0which took off in South Korea and fueled massive women's rights protests\u00a0and led to victories on issues ranging from abortion access to tougher penalties for\u00a0spycam crimes, and a\u00a0reckoning for the international K-pop music industry.",
      "Choi filed for a retrial in 2020, but lower courts initially rejected her petition. After years of campaigning and an appeal, South Korea's top court finally ordered a retrial in 2024.",

      "Fox News\u2019 CB Cotton reports on new developments in the manhunt for Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassin. Former NYPD Lt. Darrin Porcher explains the latest information in the investigation.",
      "Security experts are questioning the adequacy of the threat assessment carried out ahead of Charlie Kirk's scheduled event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, where the conservative activist was assassinated in front of thousands of attendees. The scrutiny comes as federal authorities end a manhunt for the suspect linked to the attack.",
      "\"Universities have so many speakers that come on campus all the time. Rarely do they plan for somebody taking a longer-range shot with a rifle,\" explained retired Marine Lt. Col. Hal Kempfer in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "WHAT KIRK\u2019S ASSASSINATION MEANS FOR TRUMP\u2019S SECURITY",
      "\"Sniper assassinations are far less common and even in active shooter scenarios, usually the active shooter gets into a closed space where the person is very close to where the victims are,\" he said, noting the immense difficulty of defending against an assailant who can strike from a concealed, elevated, or distant position.",
      "\"It's a lot more involved to carry out and plan for counter-sniper missions,\" Kempfer said, emphasizing that this level of violence was never anticipated at what was meant to be a debate-style discussion.",

      "The revelation underscores an unprecedented challenge confronting law enforcement as they work to protect political rallies on college campuses and in communities nationwide.",
      "\"The campus has limited security. They don't have an unlimited budget for this. They had six officers out there, which for any college campus security force, that's not an insubstantial number of officers. But they also had 3,000 people at this event,\" Kempfer said.",
      "COMPLETE COVERAGE OF CHARLIE KIRK",
      "Wednesday's event, the first in what was supposed to be a series Turning Point USA's \"American Comeback Tour,\" was nothing out of the ordinary. Kirk, the charismatic founder of the nation\u2019s conservative youth activist group, gained recognition for his signature political debates on college campuses.",
      "In addition to local security, Kirk, who spoke outdoors, was flanked by his personal security detail.",

      "Despite those measures, former FBI special agent Stuart Kaplan said the gunman may have established his position on the rooftop ahead of time, which made it difficult for security to spot him.",
      "\"He was clearly undetected, there was no indication that anybody saw him on this rooftop,\" Kaplan told Fox News host Jesse Watters in an interview on Wednesday. \"This was a very well-planned, very well-orchestrated plot that was put in motion days before,\" he said, adding that the suspect \"had some level of sophistication to have mapped out exactly how this was going to go down.\"",
      "That assessment was echoed by former New York State Senator and Homeland Security advisor Michael Balboni, who said, \"One shot hitting the target from 200 meters away and then escaping without anybody seeing them\u2014those are the hallmarks of a professional.\"",

      "\"The hardest thing to do is anticipate where the threat comes from and what threats there are. I would argue that in an open air setting like this, a rifle attack is probably the most difficult thing to stop,\" Balboni added in an interview on Fox News 5.",
      "Kaplan said that the gunmen also thought through how to evade law enforcement after taking the fatal shot.",
      "WHAT IS A BOLT ACTION RIFLE? WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE GUN USED TO KILL CHARLIE KIRK",
      "Kempfer noted that the gun recovered by authorities on Thursday was a bolt-action rifle, a common hunting weapon valued for its durability and reliability. Unlike semi-automatic weapons, he explained, a bolt-action rifle often retains the spent cartridge in the chamber rather than ejecting it, leaving no shell casings\u2014or \"brass\"\u2014for investigators to collect.",
      "\"That's just one of those things where you, if you've thought it through, you know that you can't leave any forensic evidence for investigators to work with,\" he said.",

      "The attack relies on ClickFix tactics, where victims searching for Mac troubleshooting help are lured to fake websites or GitHub repositories. These spoofed sites trick users into copying and pasting a one-line command in Terminal, supposedly to fix an error. Instead, the command silently downloads Shamos, bypasses macOS Gatekeeper protections, and installs the malware.",

These pages pose as trusted troubleshooting guides and appear in search results for common Mac issues, such as \"how to flush resolver cache.\"",

Instead, confirm with Apple's official support site or the Apple Community forums, where experienced users and moderators can verify safe troubleshooting steps.",

The entry-level iPhone 17 starts at $799.",
      "Apple positioned the price hikes as a reflection of breakthrough innovation. The company spotlighted the iPhone Air's sleek redesign, the powerful A19 chip and major camera upgrades.

The design uses recycled aluminum, glass and titanium to reduce weight while staying durable. Engineers reinforced the frame and applied new drop-test algorithms to make sure it holds up in daily use.",
      "The Air debuts silicon anode battery technology, which allows Apple to shrink the device without cutting power. During the presentation, Apple promised \"all-day battery life,\" but never gave an exact hour count. That vague description raised questions. Moments later, Apple introduced a new low-profile MagSafe battery accessory. When paired with the iPhone 17 Air, Apple says the combo delivers up to 40 hours of video playback. The timing of that announcement made it clear that battery life could still be a concern.",

That change reduces glare both indoors and outdoors, making the display easier on the eyes in all conditions.",
      "At the core of the Pro sits the new A19 Bionic chip built on 3nm architecture. Apple paired it with a 16-core Neural Engine and an updated display engine to push speed and efficiency even further.

When attached, the Air can stretch to 40 hours of video playback, turning what could have been a limitation into a selling point for Apple's ecosystem.",
      "To complement the Air's slim profile, Apple also revealed a\u00a0new translucent case and a\u00a0lightweight bumper. The translucent case keeps the 5.6mm design visible while still protecting it, while the bumper adds shock resistance around the edges without adding bulk. Both aim to reassure buyers who worry that the thinnest iPhone yet might be more fragile.",
      "For the Pro and Pro Max models, Apple introduced\u00a0TechWoven cases made from a durable fabric blend. What stood out was the addition of an\u00a0optional cross-body strap, giving users a hands-free way to carry their phones. Apple leaned into the idea of the iPhone as not just a device but also a lifestyle accessory that blends technology with personal style.",
      "Together, the MagSafe battery, translucent Air case, protective bumper and fashion-forward TechWoven cases with cross-body straps showed Apple's strategy clearly. Accessories are no longer secondary; they are central to how Apple expects customers to protect, power and personalize their iPhones.",

      "An Amazon package with a QR code. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Now the practice has shifted from harmless free items to deliberate fraud. Instead of receiving a product, many victims find only a printed QR code.

      "The less personal data available about you online, the harder it is for scammers to target you with convincing fraud attempts. Consider using data removal services that scrub your information from people-search sites and marketing databases. This reduces the chances that your address or phone number ends up in the wrong hands and is connected to a scam package.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Software updates often contain fixes for security vulnerabilities that scammers try to exploit. Running the latest version of your phone's operating system, as well as updating apps regularly, gives you stronger protection against malware that can be delivered through a malicious QR code.",
      "If an unexpected package arrives at your door with a QR code inside, do not simply throw it away. Report it to local authorities and consider filing a complaint with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Reporting not only helps protect you, but it also gives law enforcement more information to track how these scams are spreading.",

      "This scam might not be everywhere yet, but it shows just how quickly criminals adapt to new technology. QR codes were meant to make life easier, and most of the time they do, but that same convenience can turn into a weakness when people let curiosity override caution. The lesson here is that a mystery package with a QR code is not some fun puzzle to figure out. It is a red flag. The safest move is to step back, resist the urge to scan and if something feels off, report it instead of interacting with it.",

      "When private conversations end up in recaps",
      "Many people are discovering that AI notetakers capture more than project updates and strategy points. Jokes, personal stories and even casual side comments often slip into the official meeting summaries.",
      "What might feel harmless in the moment, like teasing someone, chatting about lunch plans or venting about a frustrating errand, can suddenly reappear in a recap email sent to the whole group. In some cases, even affectionate nicknames or pet mishaps have shown up right alongside serious action items.",

      "Casual catch-ups mixed into meeting notes",
      "Embarrassing slip-ups becoming part of official records",
      "These surprises can be funny in hindsight, but they highlight a bigger issue. AI notetakers don't separate casual conversation from work-related discussion. And once your words are written down, they can be saved, forwarded or even archived in ways you didn't intend. That means an offhand remark could live far longer than the meeting itself.",
      "AI AND LEARNING RETENTION: DOES CHATGPT HELP OR HURT?",
      "A Google Gemini generative artificial intelligence webpage. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why AI notetakers capture too much",
      "These tools work by recording conversations in real time and then generating automatic summaries. Zoom's AI Companion flags its presence with a diamond icon. Google Meet's version uses a pencil icon and an audio cue. Only meeting hosts can switch them on or off.",
      "That sounds transparent, but most people stop noticing the icons after a few minutes. Once the AI is running, it doesn't separate \"work talk\" from \"side chatter.\" The result? Your casual remarks can end up in a summary sent to colleagues or even clients.",
      "And mistakes happen. An AI notetaker might mishear a joke, twist sarcasm into something serious or drop a casual remark into notes where it looks out of place. Stripped of tone and context, those words can come across very differently once they're written down.",

      "Need to share a side comment? Send it as a direct message rather than saying it out loud.",
      "Keep casual conversations off recorded calls. If you need to catch up, wait until the AI is off.",
      "If you're not the host, confirm that everyone is comfortable with AI note-taking. Setting expectations up front prevents awkward situations later.",
      "Check meeting notes before forwarding them. Edit or trim out personal chatter so only useful action items remain.",
      "Find out whether transcripts are saved in the cloud or on your device. Adjust retention settings, so private conversations don't linger longer than necessary.",

      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router's brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn't reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that's easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router's admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router's admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it much harder for hackers to intercept your data. This protection works anywhere, whether you're at home, in a coffee shop or on public Wi-Fi.

Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

This number includes students, employees, applicants and, in some cases, family members. Media outlets also reported that the threat actor claimed to have stolen approximately 460 gigabytes of data from Columbia's systems.",
      "Columbia confirmed that the stolen information relates to admissions, enrollment and financial aid records, as well as certain employee data. The categories of exposed information include:",

      "When contacted, Columbia referred CyberGuy to its official community updates, published June 24 and Aug. 5.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rental car drivers are now turning to artificial intelligence to protect themselves from surprise damage fees. Major companies, such as Hertz and Sixt, have begun using automated inspection tools to detect scratches and dents.",
      "While these scanners promise efficiency, they have sparked backlash from renters who say they were unfairly billed for minor blemishes.",
      "To level the playing field, new consumer-focused apps are stepping in. Proofr, which launched recently, gives renters the ability to generate secure, time-stamped before-and-after photos of their vehicles. The app uses AI to detect even subtle changes, then encrypts and stores the images so they cannot be altered.",

      "AI-POWERED SELF-DRIVING SOFTWARE IS DISRUPTING THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY",
      "AI-powered damage detection apps like Proofr could change the way rental car companies report vehicle damage. (Proofr)",
      "How the AI-powered damage detection app works",
      "Created by 21-year-old college student Eric Kuttner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Proofr, the app helps drivers create tamper-proof evidence when renting a car. Proofr secures every scan with geotags and timestamps, while its AI automatically flags potential damage or changes. It then organizes everything into smart, exportable reports, giving renters strong leverage against unfair claims.",
      "Instead of juggling dozens of photos in your camera roll, Proofr streamlines the process. With just eight quick scans, you get a detailed before-and-after report in under a minute. You can also generate polished PDF reports instantly, which helps with rental agencies, landlords or insurance claims. Although cars are the main focus, people also use Proofr for Airbnbs, eBay listings, moving into apartments and even documenting valuables. About 85% rely on it for car rentals, while 15% use it to protect themselves in vacation homes.",
      "By combining secure evidence with AI-powered detection, Proofr positions itself as a must-have travel hack. More than a convenience, it can save travelers real money by preventing hidden fees and leveling the playing field against large agencies.",
      "The app is free to download, while full features require a Pro subscription: $2.89 weekly, $9.90 monthly or $89.90 annually. Pricing is standardized in the US, and Apple automatically adjusts it for local currencies, taxes, and exchange rates in other countries.",
      "Competition in the AI damage space",
      "Proofr is not the only player. Ravin AI originally worked with Avis and Hertz but shifted its focus toward insurers and dealerships. Still, the company now offers a free demo on its website, allowing drivers to scan its vehicles and compare damage before and after rentals.",
      "Ravin's system has been trained on 2 billion images over ten years. However, like Proofr, it is not perfect. Testers have noted missed paint chips and false positives from reflections. Both companies admit that lighting, angles and photo quality remain challenges.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "Some companies are implementing physical scanners to detect damage to rental vehicles. (ProovStation)",
      "Why rental companies are under fire",
      "The frustration comes as rental agencies roll out AI inspection systems from firms such as UVeye and ProovStation. Sixt, for example, has already installed ProovStation's AI-powered scanners at several U.S. airport locations, including Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami and Maui, with more on the way in Orlando, Washington and Nashville.",
      "These scanners automatically photograph vehicles at the start and end of each rental. The system then compares images to flag potential damage, which is later reviewed by staff before any claim is issued.",
      "Critics argue these automated tools can turn every small scratch into a profit source. Some even point to ProovStation's own marketing, which describes routine inspections as\u00a0\"gold mines of untapped opportunities.\" Industry experts stress that companies should only pursue claims for significant damage, not charge hundreds for tiny scuffs.",

      "Rental car company Sixt has already installed ProovStation scanners at several U.S. airports. (ProovStation)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rent cars regularly, AI is already shaping your experience. Rental companies are using automated inspections to justify new charges, sometimes for barely visible marks. Apps like Proofr and Ravin give you the same technology, but on your side. By scanning your car before and after your rental, you create a digital record that can help you challenge unfair claims.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The rental car industry is in the middle of a technology shift. What was once a quick glance by an employee is now a machine-driven process that can generate steep charges. Consumer apps bring transparency, but they also highlight the growing need for fairness in damage claims.",

      "The unusual love story began when Wika started chatting with Kasper, an AI designed to simulate human conversation and companionship.

Every conversation with a chatbot is stored somewhere, and that data may include deeply personal thoughts and feelings. Companies that design these bots often use the information to train future models or improve features.",
      "This raises a larger concern: who actually owns the data from an AI \"partner\"? Users may believe their chats are private, but in many cases, the company controls how the information is stored, shared or even sold. Critics warn that such emotional connections could be exploited commercially, turning intimacy into a product.",
      "As AI companions grow more common, these questions will only get louder. People may accept unconventional forms of companionship, but they also want to know their most personal moments remain secure.",

      "How to protect yourself with AI chatbots",
      "If you use AI companions or chatbots, you can still take steps to protect your privacy.",
      "Start by checking the app's privacy policy and looking for details on how conversations are stored or shared. Many users skip this step, but it tells you who controls your data.",
      "Next, avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information, passwords, or anything you would not want exposed. Even if the AI feels personal, it is still software connected to a company's servers.",
      "Finally, consider using apps that allow data deletion or offer clear privacy settings. Choosing tools that respect your control makes it easier to enjoy the benefits of AI without giving up too much personal security.",
      "Even if an AI chatbot seems safe, malware or phishing links could sneak in through related apps or ads. A trusted antivirus tool can block these threats and give you extra peace of mind. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Wika's engagement illustrates how technology can evolve from being a casual tool to something deeply personal. The divided reactions online also show the tension between skepticism and acceptance of unconventional relationships. Whether people see it as heartwarming or unsettling, this story raises bigger questions about how love and relationships may be redefined as AI continues to advance.",

    "story": [
      "Officials have identified the person accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk as 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson.",
      "Utah Governor Spencer Cox said at a press conference on Friday morning that investigators arrested and identified Robinson after analyzing surveillance footage, interviewing Robinson's family members and reviewing online messages between Robinson and his roommate.",
      "\"We got him,\" Cox said, standing with FBI Director Kash Patel and other law enforcement officials. Robinson is expected to be charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury and obstruction of justice, according to a probable cause affidavit.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Kirk, a co-founder of Turning Point USA and an influential voice in the Trump administration, was shot and killed Wednesday during an event at Utah Valley University, a public school south of Salt Lake City. His killing launched a multi-day manhunt among local, state and federal authorities.",
      "The investigation and arrest",
      "Cox said that a family member of Robinson's \u2014 Robinson's father, according to two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation \u2014 reached out to a family friend who contacted the Washington County Sheriff's Office with information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident.",
      "The governor said that investigators interviewed a family member of Robinson's who said he had \"become more political in recent years.\"",
      "\"The family member referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to September 10, and in the conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU,\" Cox said. \"They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints he had.\"",
      "Cox said that investigators interviewed Robinson's roommate, who showed authorities messages on Discord between Robinson and his roommate.",
      "The messages associated with the name Tyler state \"a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush,\" engraving bullets, \"having left the rifle wrapped in a towel\" and \"a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique,\" Cox said.",
      "Discord confirmed in statement that Robinson had an account on its instant messaging social platform \u2014 which has since been taken down \u2014 but disputed Cox's characterizations of the messages.",
      "\"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages,\" the company said. \"These were communications between the suspect\u2019s roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "Authorities said on Thursday that recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle\" in a wooded area just off the of the university campus in conditions that match Robinson's messages.",
      "Cox said the rifle was Mauser 98 .30-06 and had a scope mounted on top of it. He added that inscriptions engraved on casings found with the rifle.",
      "One of the inscriptions had the lyrics to the Italian folk song \u201cBella Ciao,\" Cox said. Another read \u201cHey fascists! Catch!\u201d with an up arrow, a right arrow and three down arrows. A third stated, \"If you read this, you are gay LMAO.\u201d",
      "According to Cox, the inscription on the casing fired said: \u201cnotices, bulges, OWO, what\u2019s this?\u201d",
      "The governor added that investigators also identified Robinson in surveillance from the Utah Valley University \u2014 where Kirk was killed on Wednesday \u2014 which showed him arriving to UVU at 8:29 a.m. in a gray Dodge Challenger.",
      "When investigators approached Robinson Thursday, he \"was observed in consistent clothing with those surveillance images,\" Cox said. Surveillance images released by the FBI on Thursday show what appears to be a young, thin man wearing a black long sleeved T-shirt with an American flag on it, black sunglasses, an Adidas hat, jeans and converse sneakers.",
      "NBC News\u2019 searches of state and national public records associated with Robinson\u2019s name and date of birth found no indication of the 22 year old having a prior criminal record.",
      "Public records indicate that Robinson's last voter registration date was on July 13, 2021, and his political party is none declared.",
      "Robinson went to Utah State University for one semester in 2021, a spokesperson for the university confirmed to NBC News.",
      "Kristin Schwiermann, 66, is one of Robinson's neighbors, worked as a custodian at his elementary school and knew him and his family from church. She described him as being \"very considerate,\" \"quiet\" and \"respectful.\"",
      "\"He was a good kid,\" she said.",
      "Trump announced arrest on Fox News",
      "President Donald Trump, who announced Kirk\u2019s death on Wednesday, was again the first to share that the suspect in Kirk's slaying was in custody on Friday morning.",
      "\"I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him \u2014 in custody ... everyone did a great job we worked with the local police, the governor, everybody did a great job,\u201d he said in an interview on Fox News.",
      "Trump suggested that the suspect's father turned him into authorities.",
      "\"Somebody that's close recognizes even a little tilt of the head, which nobody else would do,\" Trump said \"And somebody that was very close to him said 'hm, that's him' and essentially went to the father, went to a U.S. Marshal.\"",
      "\"And the father convinced the son, 'this is it,'\" Trump added.",
      "Trump repeatedly warned throughout the interview that his information was preliminary, saying he is \"always subject to be corrected.\"",
      "The latest example of political violence",
      "Kirk's killing has prompted national outrage in recent days and renewed fears over political violence in the United States. The shooting was the latest in a series of attacks and threats targeting U.S. political figures of both parties, including President Donald Trump, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.",
      "\"This is certainly about the the tragic death, assassination, political assassination of Charlie Kirk,\" Cox, a Republican, said. \"But it is also much bigger than an attack on an individual. It is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the American experiment. It is an attack on our ideals.\"",
      "Turning Point USA has not publicly commented on the arrest or the identification of the suspect.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, Turning Point USA said Kirk had faced \"thousands\" of threats throughout his life but \u201calways prioritized reaching as many young Americans as possible over his own personal safety.\u201d",
      "\"All of us will miss Charlie,\" the group said. \"None of us will ever forget him.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe think that people who like looking at children in magazines must actually like children,\u201d Shepard wrote in a 2014 essay for HuffPost. \u201cWe are betting on the chance that they like them enough to protect them from constantly being shadowed by strange men (not trying to be sexist \u2014 I\u2019m sure there are plenty of strange women in the \u2018razzi game).\u201d",

He's a real unsung hero,\" Groff said. \"He was swapping genres before 'Cowboy Carter.' He was really ahead of his time.\"",

      "Groff also talked about his performance as Darin in an April interview with Vogue. The \"Frozen\" star revealed why he tends to go in and out of character during the show.",

She\u2019s a mother by choice \u2014 she adopted Liam before we met, as a single parent, which is an awesome responsibility to take. She\u2019s devoted herself to Liam and has done a really wonderful job raising him. I\u2019m happy to now have a part of the job.\u201d",

I think a lot of it has to do with that she loves to see me doing something that I love.\u201d",

      "The single-camera and interview style show became a hit, running for nine seasons before it concluded in 2013. It also won five Emmy Awards, including outstanding comedy series.",
      "Now, over a decade later, Daniels, along with Michael Koman (\u201cNathan For You\u201d), has returned with \u201cThe Paper,\u201d a spinoff that is set in the same universe but takes on a whole new crew of quirky characters \u2014 and one familiar face.",

As the years went by, viewers got to see office romances start, fizzle and more.",
      "The 10-episode Peacock series takes viewers to Toledo, Ohio, as Ned takes over a dying historic newspaper. Filled with ambition to revive it to its glory days, he is met with opposing figures, reporters with no experience and people willing to try new things \u2014\u00a0all while the cameras capture the process.",
      "The Companies",

      "A new company, One and Done Laser, took over the office space after Dunder Mifflin was purchased by Enervate in Toledo in 2019. This leads to the company that is now highlighted in \u201cThe Paper.\u201d",

Additionally, it also sells local newspapers, including the Toledo Truth Teller, the new setting for the show.",

Novak as Ryan Howard, Leslie David Baker as Stanley Hudson, Brian Baumgartner as Kevin Malone, Angela Kinsey as Angela Martin, Phyllis Smith as Phyllis Lapin, Craig Robinson as Darryl Philbin and Oscar Nu\u00f1ez as Oscar Martinez among many others.",

      "Catherine Parrat, 71, said that she initially voted for Macron but that he \"no longer gives a damn\" and that she believes she pays too much in tax. She told NBC News she was disappointed by Wednesday's turnout, saying there were not enough people to make an impact.",
      "For police, there was an element of unpredictability: The demonstrations are decentralized and leaderless, with no specific union, organization or individual leading the charge.",
      "On the eve of the demonstrations, Retailleau, the outgoing interior minister, said no violence would be tolerated and announced the deployment of 80,000 police and gendarmes \u2014 the French military police.",
      "It is a show of force not seen since the height of the Yellow Vests protests in 2018, sparked by Macron\u2019s proposed fuel tax to curb carbon emissions."

      "\u201cI was home alone. I packed my things in a panic,\u201d the teenager told NBC News, describing the morning in October 2022, eight months after Russian forces captured the city, when he said the soldiers forced him to get into a car and drove away \u201cin an unknown direction.\u201d",
      "It was the start of an eight-month nightmare as the teenager became part of a systematic effort by Russia to relocate and re-educate thousands of children from Ukraine, in some cases forcibly adopting them while sending others to military training camps.",

      "Kuleba, whose organization says it has rescued more than 750 children from Russia and Ukrainian territories occupied by its forces, says the push for their removal and re-education came from the highest levels of the Kremlin.",
      "The International Criminal Court has accused Putin of the war crime of overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia, and in March 2023 it issued a warrant for his arrest. The ICC has also accused Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, Putin\u2019s presidential commissioner for children\u2019s rights, of committing similar crimes.",
      "\u201cThey force these kids to be Russian, to be Russian soldiers,\u201d Kuleba said in a telephone interview last month, adding: \u201cThe Russian regime has a clear intention to annihilate Ukrainian identity.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey tried to break me in every possible way,\u201d he said, adding that he was treated \u201cvery badly\u201d and denied food in the first camp because he \u201cbegan to show my pro-Ukrainian position.\u201d",
      "On one occasion, he said, he \u201ctook down the Russian flag and hung my underwear there.\u201d This led to him being thrown into solitary confinement for a week, he said, adding that his captors \u201cfed me twice a day, did not allow me to communicate with anyone at all.\u201d",
      "Another time, he said, the head of security at one of the camps tore a girl\u2019s T-shirt and trampled on it because it bore Ukraine\u2019s coat of arms.",
      "In regular classes with other Ukrainian children whose ages ranged from 6 to 18, he said, \u201cWe learned everything about Russia only, the history of Russia and so on,\u201d adding that they also talked about recent events in the war, like what Ukrainian territories had been captured.",
      "\u201cI understood that Russia is an aggressor country and it took away my childhood and severed my contacts with my family so that I would not see them,\u201d he said.",
      "On the morning of his capture, Vlad said, he had managed to call his mother, Tatiana, 38, to tell her that he had been kidnapped.",
      "Tatiana said she wasn\u2019t home when he was taken because she had been taken to the Russian commandant\u2019s office to write a statement about her mother, Rudenko Tamara, 53, who died in an attack the previous day. They wanted her to say \u201cthat Ukraine killed my mother,\u201d she said.",
      "On the call, Tatiana said, Vlad told her he was in the city of Olezhky and was \u201cgoing to Crimea to rest,\u201d which left her bewildered. \u201cAt that moment we just had a little fight,\u201d she added. \u201cI simply told him, \u2018How could you leave your family at such a difficult time?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know any details.\u201d",
      "Along with other parents, she only realized much later that Russian soldiers had been coaching children to say they were being evacuated from bombing and sent to summer camps.",
      "With fighting intense in Kherson, even after Russian forces were pushed out of the city in November 2022, Tatiana said that the month after the kidnapping, she decided to move west to the city of Mykolaiv.",

NBC News agreed not to use Oleksandr\u2019s last name as he was called up to Ukraine\u2019s army in February 2023 and is still serving. Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Although Vlad\u2019s phone was routinely checked by his Russian captors, Tatiana said, she was able to keep in touch with her son through occasional text messages, but she \u201ctold him not to create problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cI said when you can, if you are there alone or no one is escorting you, then write,\u201d she said, adding that she was able to establish he was being held in a camp in Lazurne in southeast Ukraine.",
      "After a friend told her about Save Ukraine, Tatiana said, she reached out to the organization, which after several months of planning arranged for her to travel to Russia along with six other women whose children had been taken.",
      "With no direct route across the front lines, Tatiana said, she traveled through Poland, Belarus and Russia\u2019s capital, Moscow, before she was eventually able to travel to the camp via Crimea.",
      "No one from Save Ukraine accompanied the group, she said, but its representatives were in touch by phone and arranged for her to be put up by a volunteer in a temporary home.",
      "Although she was roughly searched by masked men on arrival, Tatiana said, things initially seemed to be going well. But on the second day, she said, agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB spy agency, came around, put a mask over her head and took her somewhere for questioning, after \u201cconfiscating my documents and my phone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",
      "They also brought a cameraman and a journalist, who she said expected her to say \u201chow great Russia is, how it helps us and how bad Ukraine is for us.\u201d",
      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",
      "The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After giving the interview on camera, she said, she was released with Vlad and allowed to make the arduous journey home.",

      "The group has monitored the movement of children by analyzing satellite photos and photographing airplanes and vehicles apparently used to transport the kids, among other techniques.",

      "Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",
      "But both Save Ukraine and the HRL took a financial hit last spring after the Trump administration cut funding for their programs.",
      "As Russia pushes to take control of more Ukrainian territory, rescuing the Ukrainian children has become an even more urgent issue, experts say.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get all the kids we can back before the door closes,\u201d Raymond said.",
      "\u201cNow is the decisive moment when America cannot allow itself to step back,\u201d added Kuleba, of Save Ukraine.",
      "As for Vlad, who is now 19, he said thinking about his family kept him going during his time in captivity, and he rushed to see his baby sister Stefania as soon as he got home.",
      "Now in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, he is hoping to become a sports trainer.",
      "\u201cWhat helped me all the time was probably that I had family in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could return to Ukraine and build a normal future.",

      "The Global Sumud Flotilla said Alma, a British-flagged boat in the civilian fleet, was hit by a drone while it was docked in the second such strike in two days. On Monday, the group said that one of its main boats, which is Portuguese-flagged, was also hit.",
      "Both incidents caused fire damage but no injuries, according to GSF.",
      "The attacks are an \u201corchestrated attempt to distract and derail\u201d the group\u2019s mission to deliver aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, GSF said in a statement, stressing that members were \u201cundeterred.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur peaceful voyage to break Israel\u2019s illegal siege on Gaza and stand in unwavering solidarity with its people presses forward with determination and resolve,\u201d it added.",
      "While a \u201cfull investigation\u201d is ongoing, Alma crew members have recovered a charred electronic device from the deck that further indicates the boat was \u201cdeliberately targeted,\u201d GSF said in a separate statement on Instagram.",
      "A spokesperson for the Tunisian Coast Guard did not respond to a call on the latest reported attack from Reuters on Wednesday.",
      "Officials earlier denied that the first boat had been attacked by a drone, saying the explosion came from inside the vessel. A National Guard spokesperson told local media that claims of the first drone attack on the flotilla \u201chave no basis in truth,\u201d Reuters reported Tuesday.",
      "With around 20 boats and participants from 44 countries, including activist Greta Thunberg, the group is the largest civilian maritime attempt to break the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory.",
      "Miguel Duarte, a crew member, said the suspected drone stopped close to the flotilla, moved slowly to the front and then dropped \u201cwhat was obviously a bomb\u201d on the forward part of the deck.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear 100%. It was a drone dropping a bomb on the forward deck of our ship,\u201d Duarte said when he was asked whether the team was \u201cabsolutely certain that this was a drone attack,\u201d a video he posted on Instagram shows.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m OK, but we could have been killed, right?\u201d Duarte said, citing the deaths during the Israel-Hamas war of humanitarian and medical workers.",
      "\u201cWe know the dangers that we\u2019re facing,\u201d he said.",
      "After the explosion, crew members repeatedly yelled for help and sounded the fire alarm, according to a CCTV video shared by Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s confirmed that this is a drone attack, it will be an assault and aggression against Tunisia and against Tunisian sovereignty,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cAnd again, we cannot keep on tolerating this and normalizing the illegal.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators gathered at the port of Tunis around 2 a.m. local time (10 p.m. Monday ET), some waving Palestinian and Turkish flags and chanting \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d according to a video reposted by GSF.",
      "In 2010, Israeli forces stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza and killed at least nine pro-Palestinian activists, sparking global outrage.",
      "In June, Israel intercepted a vessel of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla and detained all 12 people on board, including Thunberg.",
      "Starvation deaths in Gaza surged after Israel\u2019s blockade in March, and aid was resumed in May under a system backed by the United States and Israel. Since then, nearly 1,400 people have died and 4,000 more have been injured seeking food, with at least 859 killed near aid sites, the United Nations says."

      "Hundreds of South Korean nationals arrested in an immigration raid last week were en route to the airport in Atlanta where they will leave for Seoul later Thursday, the South Korean foreign ministry said, after their flight was previously delayed on what the ministry said were orders from President Donald Trump.",
      "More than 300 South Koreans \u2014 307 men and 10 women \u2014 were detained in the Sept. 4 raid on a Hyundai plant in Georgia, the ministry said, one of whom has decided to remain in the U.S. rather than agree to \u201cvoluntary departure.\u201d The 316 others will be on the flight to Seoul, along with 14 employees of South Korean companies from other Asian countries: 10 from China, three from Japan and one from Indonesia.",
      "The workers were released from the Folkston ICE Processing Center in rural Georgia at 2:18 a.m. ET, the foreign ministry said, and were being driven several hours to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport where a plane sent by the South Korean government is waiting for them.",
      "The Korean Air plane is scheduled to leave Atlanta at noon ET and arrive in Seoul on Friday around 4 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET).",
      "South Korean officials originally hoped the plane would leave Atlanta as early as Wednesday afternoon local time, shortly after it arrived from Seoul. But the foreign ministry said its departure was likely to be delayed \u201cdue to circumstances on the U.S. side,\u201d and an airport spokesperson later said the charter flight had been canceled.",
      "At a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun learned that Trump had ordered the suspension of the repatriation process in order to discuss with South Korea whether its detained nationals \u2014 all of them skilled workers who were helping set up an electric vehicle battery plant \u2014 should remain in the U.S. to continue their work rather than be sent home.",
      "Cho told Rubio that it would be better for them to return home first and then re-enter the U.S. \u201csince these individuals were already in shock and are exhausted,\u201d a South Korean government official said.",
      "The official said that the U.S. agreed to repatriate the South Koreans and that Trump had instructed that they be transported to the airport without physical restraints such as handcuffs, in a departure from standard U.S. practice.",
      "Images of South Koreans being shackled at the wrists and ankles have caused outrage in South Korea, a key U.S. ally in Asia that has pledged hundreds of billions in U.S. investment as part of tariff negotiations. The raid came weeks after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung reinforced that commitment at a meeting with Trump at the White House.",
      "\u201cWe believe that President Trump\u2019s consideration in this regard stems from the deep bonds formed between the two leaders at the successful South Korea-U.S. summit, as well as the consistent position our government has maintained on this detention issue,\u201d the South Korean government official said.",
      "Lee said all but one of the 317 detained South Koreans had elected to fly home.",
      "\u201cEach person was allowed to choose, and the U.S. government said essentially, \u2018If you want to go, you may go; if you want to stay, you may stay,\u2019\u201d Lee said at a news conference in Seoul marking his 100th day in office.",
      "The raid has raised concerns about the potential impact on U.S.-South Korea relations, though Lee said his government had \u201cnot considered it to that depth yet.\u201d",
      "He said the incident could make South Korean companies more hesitant to invest in the U.S., where they have long sent employees on a temporary basis to provide training or assistance in areas where U.S. expertise is lacking.",
      "\u201cIf this is not allowed, companies will inevitably worry: \u2018If setting up factories in the U.S. brings endless restrictions and difficulties, should we even proceed?\u2019\u201d Lee said.",
      "What happened?",
      "The South Korean nationals were among the 475 people federal and immigration agents arrested in the raid on a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building an electric vehicle battery plant.",
      "U.S. officials, who said the arrested people were working or living in the country illegally, have described the raid as the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. No criminal charges have been filed.",
      "Of the detained South Koreans, 47 were employed by LG Energy Solution and the rest were hired by subcontractors. Hyundai, South Korea\u2019s largest automaker, said none of its direct employees were detained.",
      "Most of the detained South Koreans either were engineers or they worked in after-sales services and installation, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who is representing at least seven of them. He said they were in the U.S. under various visa programs that South Koreans and other foreign nationals have long used to do business in the country in the face of U.S. bureaucratic delays and murky regulations.",
      "Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition, said Monday that the detained workers should not be blamed for the challenges companies face trying to secure the proper U.S. visas for employees who are key to getting new facilities up and running.",
      "James S. Kim, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, said Wednesday in an interview in Seoul: \u201cI wish that Americans in America would be a little bit more sympathetic to what the Koreans have witnessed. And as long as they do that, I think the two countries can work together to kind of mitigate what had happened and move forward.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s behind the raid?",
      "Federal authorities showed up at the Hyundai-LG plant to execute a judicial search warrant in connection with what they said was a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices.",
      "According to the warrant, agents were authorized to seize employment records and immigration documents, as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site. Authorities were also looking for four people, but the reasons the federal government was specifically interested in them remain under seal.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. and South Korean government officials reached a deal to release the workers from immigration custody and return them to their home country.",
      "Consulate officials and other South Korean officials met with those detained at the Folkston ICE Processing Center over the weekend, Meredyth Yoon, a litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, which has been assisting detainees and their families seeking legal help, told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Yoon said that, as part of the deal, most of the South Korean nationals had agreed to \u201cvoluntary departure,\u201d avoiding formal deportation orders.",
      "She said that about 175 of the remaining detainees \u2014 who hail from Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela \u2014 remain in immigration detention and that her organization is working to connect the affected families to aid."

The Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed that the phone call happened, saying they \"exchanged views in a candid and constructive manner\" and agreed to more talks.",
      "\"Secretary Hegseth made clear that the United States does not seek conflict with China nor is it pursuing regime change or strangulation of the PRC,\" chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said. \"At the same time, however, he forthrightly relayed that the U.S. has vital interests in the Asia-Pacific, the priority theater, and will resolutely protect those interests.\"",
      "Details of the lawmakers' visit are being tightly held, and even senior members of the committee were unaware it was happening. A Rogers spokesperson did not respond to questions about the trip.",
      "Smith declined to provide the names of lawmakers who will be attending or the exact dates of the travel. However, the House will be on a recess the week of Sept. 22 for the Rosh Hashanah holiday.",
      "The CODEL will also include a stop in Cambodia, Smith said, but Taiwan will not be on the itinerary.",
      "The visit comes as the Trump administration and Beijing continue negotiating a trade deal. Trump has imposed significant tariffs on China and other trading partners, but he extended the deadline to Nov. 10 for those tariffs to kick in, to give the two sides more time to strike a deal.",
      "\"My important message is, you know, we have to have dialogue and communication,\" Smith said. \"I am deeply worried that, yes, China is a major rising power that we seem to be talking less and less to. We need to figure out a way to resolve our differences and can't do it by not talking to each other.\"",
      "In 2023, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a bipartisan delegation of senators to China, where they met with Xi and discussed issues such as trade, economic competition and fentanyl, according to Schumer.",
      "But House lawmakers had not visited China since March 2019, when Reps. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill. \u2014 then the co-chairs of the U.S.-China Working Group \u2014 led a bipartisan group to Beijing. Unlike an official government-funded CODEL, that 2019 trip was sponsored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.",
      "The Covid-19 pandemic struck a year later, and official House travel to the region has since focused on Taiwan, Japan and other U.S. allies.",
      "In 2022, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made an unannounced visit to Taiwan during a CODEL to Asia, angering Beijing and sparking live-fire military exercises around the self-governing island that China claims as its own.",
      "A year later, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., led a House delegation to Taiwan and met with then-President Tsai Ing-wen, just as Pelosi\u2019s group did.",
      "And in 2024, then-Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, led a House delegation to meet with Taiwan\u2019s new president, Lai Ching-te, promising that more weapons were on the way."

      "Australia has approved the first vaccine to protect its shrinking koala population against chlamydia, a disease that accounts for as many as half of deaths in the wild among the country\u2019s iconic marsupials.",
      "Researchers spent over 10 years developing the single-dose vaccine, which Australia\u2019s veterinary medicine regulator has approved for use in wildlife hospitals and veterinary clinics and in the field.",
      "There are estimated to be 224,000 to 524,000 koalas left in Australia, according to Australia\u2019s national science agency, which cited numbers from the National Koala Monitoring Program. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the koala population has been cut in half in the past 20 years.",
      "Since 2022, they have been listed as endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, where the monitoring program estimates the combined population is 95,000 to 238,000.",
      "Along with habitat loss, climate change and bushfires, a major reason for koalas\u2019 vulnerability is chlamydia, a sexually transmitted infection also found in humans that can cause infertility and blindness.",
      "It is not uncommon for half the koalas within a population to be infected, and rates can go as high as 70%, said Peter Timms, a professor of microbiology who led the research at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.",
      "\u201cSome individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day,\u201d Timms said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "While both male and female koalas can contract chlamydia through physical contact such as mating, it is a different strain from the one found in humans. A joey can also contract it from an infected mother\u2019s pouch.",
      "The vaccine was found to have reduced the likelihood of koalas\u2019 developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.",
      "Before it was approved, the vaccine was tested on more than 500 koalas in eight trials.",
      "According to Samuel Phillips, a molecular microbiologist and senior researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast who worked on the project, the vaccine offers three levels of protection: reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and in some cases reversing existing symptoms.",
      "\u201cRegistration of the vaccine has been very challenging,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cWe started this five years ago, thinking it would take one year, and here we are. Five years later, we finally got to the point.\u201d",
      "Until now, the only treatment available to koalas infected with chlamydia was antibiotics, but they can make it difficult for koalas to digest food, leading to starvation and sometimes even death.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite humbling, really. I keep thinking to myself, [I] can\u2019t believe that we did this,\u201d Phillips said."

      "Israel's brazen strike on Doha, the capital of the influential Gulf state that has played a key role in negotiations, was roundly condemned as an escalation that threatened to derail efforts to end the war.",

      "It raised fears that there would be no truce to avert Israel's threatened ground assault on famine-stricken Gaza City, where it has ordered residents to immediately leave the area and bombed high-rise buildings it says are used by Hamas.",
      "The Israeli attack hit an area surrounded by residences, diplomatic missions and international schools. The front of one building appeared blackened Wednesday when an NBC News team traveled to the site. Security surrounded the building, preventing onlookers from getting close."
