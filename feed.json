      "Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days",
      "NEW YORK -- Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days. But Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners,\u201d led by twin Michael B. Jordans, proved a bloody exception to modern movie rules, launching with $45.6 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d a Warner Bros. release that cost about $90 million to produce, was a bold gamble on originality \u2014 albeit with genre elements \u2014 and one of the most bankable American directors in Coogler. The \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director wrote and produced \u201cSinners,\u201d a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the year\u2019s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release. That gave Warner Bros., after a handful of disappointments, an enviable one-two punch at the box office with one original, director-driven movie and one IP-based property.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which Warner Bros. co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has amassed $720.8 million worldwide in three weeks of release.",
      "Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, co-chairs of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, celebrated the two films\u2019 resonance with moviegoers. The studio accounted for a remarkable 64% of the domestic box office for the Easter weekend.",
      "\u201cMovies have the power to transport us to worlds only seen on the big screen, and Warner Bros. Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,\u201d Abdy and De Luca said in a statement Sunday.",
      "But all eyes were on the performance on \u201cSinners,\u201d which Warner Bros. went to extreme lengths to secure. Abdy and De Luca agreed to give Coogler not just a cut of gross ticket sales but ownership of the film after 25 years \u2014 a virtually unheard of concession.",
      "But Coogler and Jordan, whose collaborations stretch back to \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d make up one of the industry\u2019s most potent director-actor duos. Reviews (98% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for \u201cSinners\u201d and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.",
      "Overseas, \u201cSinners\u201d faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, \u201cSinners\u201d attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian.",
      "Before \u201cSinners,\u201d dual roles had been rough business for Warner Bros. The studio saw flops in both \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d (a period gangster film featuring a doubled Robert De Niro) and \u201cMickey 17\u201d (a sci-fi movie with two Robert Pattinsons).",
      "But the strong opening for \u201cSinners,\u201d which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler\u2019s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences. Another would be Jordan Peele, whose \u201cNope\u201d (2022) debuted similarly with $44.3 million.",
      "Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d an animated tale of Jesus\u2019 life aimed at Christian audiences, capitalized on the Easter weekend, grossing $17.2 million in its second week of release. That was nearly equal to its opening weekend ($19.1 million), and brought \u201cThe King of Kings\u201d to a domestic total of $45.3 million.",
      "Bleecker Street\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d Andrew Ahn\u2019s reimagining of Ang Lee\u2019s 1993 queer comedy of errors, opened on 1,142 North American screens with $922,906 in ticket sales. \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d a hit at the Sundance Film Festival, stars Lily Gladstone, Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran and newcomer Han Gi-chan.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \u201cSinners,\u201d $45.6 million.",
      "2. \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d $41.3 million.",
      "3. \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d $17.3 million.",

      "Two days later, officers received another report at Chick-fil-A and took Seiders into custody. They searched his home and found evidence connecting him to the two incidents. His charges include possession of child sex abuse materials, molesting a child, and invasion of privacy, the sheriff's department said.",
      "The Riverside County Public Defender's Office declined to comment on Seiders' behalf.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The last time Keri Hilson put out an album, Barack Obama was in the second year of his first term as U.S. president, the iPad was released and Instagram was brand new.",
      "\u201cOn some days, I\u2019m like that was just a blink away. But for the most part, yeah, it feels like a long time because I\u2019ve been waiting. I felt stagnant, I felt stuck for a while, and conflicted,\u201d said the two-time Grammy-nominated artist. \u201cI\u2019m very much approaching this like I\u2019m starting over because that\u2019s how it feels to me. I\u2019ve lived nine lives since I last released \u2026 I\u2019m a whole different person.\u201d",
      "Hilson, the 42-year-old R&B star known for late 2000s hits like \u201cKnock You Down,\u201d featuring Kanye West and Ne-Yo. and \u201cPretty Girl Rock,\u201d released \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d on Friday. It's her third album, following 2010\u2019s \u201cNo Boys Allowed,\u201d and is the first of a trilogy set for release this year. Led by the sultry single \u201cBae,\u201d the nine-track album delves into romance and introspection.",
      "\u201cI feel resolved, both with the art and within about stepping back into the light. So, I think that resolve kind of had to be found before I felt confident enough to release the body of work and also unleash myself to the world again,\u201d explained Hilson, who said she\u2019s never stopped recording. \u201cThere were songs in my past that I felt were political moves, songs I didn\u2019t really love that I had to sing \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to feel like that this time around.\u201d",
      "One of those songs was a leaked remix to her popular 2009 single \u201cTurnin Me On\u201d featuring Lil Wayne, which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lyrics included a diss fans perceived to be aimed at Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "Hilson, who had yet to drop her introductory album, \u201cIn A Perfect World,\u201d which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on Top R&B albums, claimed that she was forced to sing the lines, \u201cShe can sing / But she need to move it to the left, left,\u201d assumed to reference Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIrreplaceable.\u201d She says she was threatened her album might not be released if she refused.",
      "Last week, Hilson trended on social media following an interview with iHeartMedia\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d after recalling the incident. While she has talked about it several times in the past, during that interview, the singer publicly named those involved, including producer Polow Da Don who she was signed to. She did not name singer-songwriter Ester Dean. However, after social media users tagged Dean in posts, she later identified herself.",
      "The ending of a decadelong relationship, a lack of control over her career and the intense, never-ending backlash from the BeyHive triggered depression and led to her retreat from music.",
      "During her time away, the Georgia native embarked on a journey of healing that included therapy, journaling and spiritual retreats.",
      "\u201cThere were some perspectives that I needed to uncover ... untruths, beliefs that I kind of picked up or inherited about myself,\u201d said Hilson, who shifted to acting.",
      "Her comeback has included very selective press, avoiding what she describes as \u201cnew media\u201d outlets such as social media-driven platforms, saying monetization can reward the promotion of gossip or incentivize the creation of lies. The salacious blog culture of the 2010s was a driving force in fanning the flames of her perceived beef with Beyonc\u00e9, who has never publicly commented on the situation.",
      "Hilson \u201ccan definitely operate and navigate within the realm of R&B. She has a fan base,\u201d said Keithan Samuels, founder of the popular website RatedRnB.com. \u201cHer core fan base has matured \u2026 she can navigate within this new era of R&B where there\u2019s a lot of diversity and sound.\u201d",
      "Crafted with unofficial writing camps and records created throughout the years, \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d finds Hilson delivering vulnerable and flirty lyrics over a wide range of R&B sounds. Writing on all but one song, she avoided current R&B trends that developed during her absence, citing individuality as a key to her early success. She also believes algorithms have created a culture of musical homogeny, rather than creativity.",
      "There are quintessential \u201cMs. Keri Baby\u201d songs like the fun, Pop&B styled \u201cSomethin (Bout U),\u201d but there\u2019s also the introspective \u201cNaked (Love),\u201d and \u201cSay It,\u201d in which she expresses, \u201cI won\u2019t say I love you / \u2018til you say you love me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very \u2018girl boss\u2019 in my life, right? When it comes to relationships, I prefer to be a lady. I prefer to be approached. \u2026 I prefer for the man to say \u2018I love you\u2019 first. I just prefer for a man to lead,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI\u2019m really a damsel \u2013 without the distress.\u201d",
      "The bedroom mood is set on the sexy slow jam \u201cScream,\u201d while the bright \u201cWhatever\u201d floats with beautiful stacked harmonies.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s something I would have written for Whitney. And I actually wrote a song for Whitney that she never was able to record,\u201d said Hilson, who began her career as an in-demand writer whose credits include songs for Chris Brown, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. \u201cThis reminds me of a Whitney Houston record, where I think she would be now.\u201d",
      "Samuels of RatedRnB.com says this project is evident of the newfound control Hilson has over her career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not, to me, an attempt to have this commercial comeback \u2026 it feels more personal,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cThe other two albums, I feel like were more catered to what was current then.\u201d",
      "Hilson says she\u2019s still open to writing for other artists and giving away songs that may not fit her current musical era. She also has a new Lifetime movie, \u201cFame: A Temptations Story,\u201d co-starring Keshia Chant\u00e9, premiering April 26 at 8 p.m. EDT. Hilson says acting is now an equal part of her career.",
      "Though Hilson may be cautiously re-emerging musically, fans are welcoming her return. After The Breakfast Club interview, fans flooded her with sympathy and positivity, possibly due to a combination of her finally telling her side of the story in detail, as well as the passing of time. Some fans said they forgot about the incident or were too young to know about it.",
      "\u201cI just control what I can control \u2026 I control what I allow to bring me up or down. These are realizations that I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been away,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI feel unburdened \u2026 I\u2019m not projecting too much of the past onto now, and all of that is freeing.\u201d",

      "Judge Paul Goetz late Thursday ordered that Weinstein be immediately relocated from the city\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail complex to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan so he can receive necessary medical treatment.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers lobbied for the move as jury selection got underway this week.",
      "They argued in court papers that being locked up in a sometimes freezing jail cell was exacerbating the Oscar-winning producer's health issues, which include chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes and walking difficulties that require a wheelchair to get in and out of court.",
      "Goetz\u2019s order will remain in effect at least until next Thursday, when he is set to hold a hearing to discuss the matter further.",
      "A different judge, Curtis Farber, is presiding over Weinstein's retrial. The case will resume Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week. In all, 12 jurors and six alternates need to be seated.",
      "Weinstein is being tried again on rape and sexual assault charges after New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial, finding that improper rulings and prejudicial testimony tainted the original one.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Weinstein has been back and forth numerous times to Bellevue in recent months for treatment of various maladies. At a pretrial hearing in January, he railed against his treatment at Rikers, telling Farber he wanted to \u201cget out of this hellhole as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Weinstein's lawyers filed a legal claim against New York City last November, alleging he was receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at Rikers. The claim, which seeks $5 million in damages, argues that Weinstein has been returned to Rikers each time before fully recovering at the hospital.",
      "The troubled jail complex has faced growing scrutiny for its mistreatment of detainees and dangerous conditions. Last year, a federal judge cleared the way for a possible federal takeover, finding the city had placed inmates in \u201cunconstitutional danger.\u201d",

      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar's performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year's Super Bowl, adding it to his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over the diss track and its allegations of pedophilia against Drake.",
      "\u201cThe Recording was performed during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever, over 133 million people, including millions of children, and millions more who had never before heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,\" says the amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "It adds, \"It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist.\u201d",
      "Although Lamar removed the word \u201cpedophile\u201d that's in the track during the halftime show, the fact that it was omitted showed that \u201cnearly everyone understands that it is defamatory,\u201d the suit says. It also alleges Universal Music used financial benefits and leveraged business relationships to secure the headliner spot for Lamar at the Super Bowl, and promoted the performance.",
      "\u201cDrake\u2019s amended complaint makes an already strong case stronger,\u201d his lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. \"Drake will expose the evidence of UMG\u2019s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions.\u201d",
      "This year's Super Bowl and its halftime show were the most-watched ever, according to Nielsen.",
      "In a statement responding to the court filing, Universal Music, the parent record label of both artists, continued to deny Drake's allegations.",

      "The amended lawsuit also adds that defamatory portions of \u201cNot Like Us\" were played at the Grammy Awards in February, when the single won five awards, including song and record of the year. The suit claims that Universal Music also helped secure the Grammy nominations and allowed the song to be played at the ceremony.",
      "Drake sued Universal Music, but not Lamar, for undisclosed damages in January, saying the company published and promoted \u201cNot Like Us\u201d despite its false pedophilia allegations and suggestions that listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home and two attempted break-ins there, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand\u2019s value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The amended lawsuit also adds more online comments indicating people believe the pedophilia allegations.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner with 22 Grammy wins, have been beefing for years. The feud is among the biggest in hip hop in recent years.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year, as both launched diss tracks at each other, including Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d Lamar raps.",
      "In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Universal Music says Drake helped fuel the beef with his own inflammatory diss tracks aimed at Lamar.",
      "\u201cPlaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,\" the motion says. \"Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.\u201d",

By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance.",
      "Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany.

      "He formed his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, to develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was \u201cHeadline Chasers,\u201d a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season.

    "story": [
      "Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d has become a phenomenon",
      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose, oh! What if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",
      "\u201cI was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, \u2018What, you saw moose in the city?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s on the TV,\u2019\u201d Garp Liljefors said.",
      "Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.",
      "\u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it\u2019s the great migration,\u2019\" she said. \"They know.\u201d",

      "A woman in the southern African country of Namibia runs a program that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism",
      "WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Susan de Meyer's horses have different effects on different children. Hyperactive kids learn to be a little quieter around them while nonverbal children are moved to communicate and to bond with them.",
      "De Meyer runs a program in the southern African country of Namibia that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like ADHD and autism.",
      "Each weekday morning, de Meyer's dusty paddock just outside the capital, Windhoek, is enlivened by a group of eight to 10 children from one of the special schools she helps. The children ride the horses, groom them, stroke them and often, de Meyer says, talk to them.",
      "De Meyer grew up on a farm surrounded by horses and they've always been part of her life. She said they have a quality that is invaluable: They don't judge the children, no matter how different they are.",
      "\u201cThe horse is the hero in this whole situation because these kids don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people,\" de Meyer said.",
      "De Meyer's program, \"Enabling Through the Horse,\" is supported by the Namibian Equestrian Federation and won an award last year from the International Equestrian Federation because it \u201cunderlines the wonderful characteristics of the horse in exuding sensitivity and intuition.\u201d",
      "Horse therapy has been promoted by autism groups and those that work with children with learning disabilities as having a positive impact. And animal therapy in general has been found to be useful in many instances, like dogs that help military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and therapy cats that are taken to hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Some survivors of the devastating 2023 Hawaii wildfires found relief in horse therapy while grieving loved ones they had lost.",
      "De Meyer jokes she has \u201ctwo-and-a-half horses.\u201d These include two Arabians \u2014 a white mare named Faranah and a brown gelding, Lansha \u2014 while the \u201chalf\u201d is a miniature horse called Bonzi, who is about head-high for a 5-year-old.",
      "The Arabians are often the most useful for the children's therapy because of their size, de Meyer said.",
      "\u201cIt gives them self-esteem. When they stroke the horse, the therapy starts because this is a very big animal compared to their height, and they are not scared to stroke the horse ... and then to ride it and tell the horse what they want,\u201d she said.",
      "De Meyer works with children with a range of conditions or disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Down syndrome, those who are nonverbal or touch sensitive, and some who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome and have developmental problems.",
      "She has received interest from other countries in Africa and Asia to start similar programs there.",
      "\u201cThe changes that I\u2019ve seen with the learners are significant,\u201d said Chriszell Louw, a teacher at Dagbreek School, which says it is one of just two government schools in Namibia for children with intellectual disabilities. \u201cWe have a learner that likes to talk a lot. When we come here, she knows she has to keep quiet. She sits in her place.\u201d",
      "\"Some of them you see they are more open, they are happy. Some of them were very scared when they started with the horse riding but now they are very excited. When they hear we\u2019re going to the horses they are very excited and just want to go by themselves,\u201d Louw said.",
      "De Meyer said her program helps with fine-motor skills, gross-motor skills, muscle strengthening, coordination, balance and posture, all important for kids who struggle to sit at a desk at school and learn.",
      "One simple exercise de Meyer has children do when they ride is to let go of the reins and stretch their arms out straight and to the sides, using only their torso and lower body to balance as a groom leads the horse around the paddock.",
      "Some of the kids break out in smiles when they let go and look like they're soaring.",
      "\"We make the world different for these kids,\" de Meyer said.",

      "Amazon and Walmart are undergoing national expansions in same-day prescription deliveries. They\u2019re joining a trend that has gained momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugstore chains and companies like Instacart and DoorDash rushing to deliver prescriptions as soon as possible.",
      "Fast prescription delivery options are growing as traditional drugstores close and more people use telemedicine or subscription-based care that encourages regular deliveries.",
      "But this trend may run into limits in the complicated U.S. health care system, where drug costs and coverage can outweigh convenience for consumers, some of whom still like visiting a store.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot to change people\u2019s behavior when it comes to their health care,\u201d said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst with the consulting firm Forrester.",
      "Independent drugstores have done same-day deliveries for years, especially for patients who are homebound or recovering from surgeries, said Brigid Groves, a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association.",
      "CVS Health started same-day deliveries in 2017 and has since expanded its reach. The chain delivered more than 4 million prescriptions through that service in 2023.",
      "Walgreens also does this nationally and offers a service at hundreds of locations that will deliver within two hours.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,\u201d Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall.",
      "The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists.",
      "Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items.",
      "It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour.",
      "Customer demand drove Walmart\u2019s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company.",
      "Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window.",
      "\u201cThis is just elevating that level of convenience,\u201d he said.",
      "Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine.",
      "McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has \u201cbig plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.\u201d",
      "Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more.",
      "Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly.",
      "People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp.",
      "\u201cThe practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,\u201d he said.",
      "Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies.",
      "Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store.",

If you can\u2019t wash your hair every day, try covering it when you go outside with a hat or scarf. Don\u2019t get in the bed with your outside clothes on, because the pollen will follow.",
      "It's also useful to rinse your eyes and nose with saline to remove any pollen, experts said. And the same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won\u2019t help with eye symptoms.",
      "Over-the-counter nasal sprays are among the most effective treatments for seasonal allergies, experts said.",
      "But the vast majority of patients use them incorrectly, irritating parts of the nose, said Dr. Kathleen Mays, an allergist at Augusta University in Georgia. She suggested angling the nozzle outward toward your ear rather than sticking it straight up your nose.",
      "Over-the-counter allergy pills like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec are helpful, but may not be as effective as quickly since they're taken by mouth, experts said.",
      "Experts also said that if your allergy symptoms are impacting your quality of life, like causing you to lose sleep or a lack focus at work or school, it might be time to consider an allergist appointment for immunotherapies.",
      "Some remedies for allergy relief that have been circulating on social media or suggested by celebrities \u2014 like incorporating local honey into your diet to expose yourself to pollen \u2014 have been debunked.",
      "Dr. Shayam Joshi, an allergist at Oregon Health and Science University, said that's because the flowers that bees pollinate typically don't contain the airborne pollen that causes allergy symptoms.",
      "With climate change, winters are milder and growing seasons are longer, meaning there\u2019s more opportunity for pollen to stay in the air, resulting in longer and more severe allergy seasons.",
      "In many areas across the country, pollen counts have broken decades of records. In late March, the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Center measured a pollen count of over 14,000 grains per cubic meter, which is considered extremely high.",

      "First, the nation\u2019s top law firms",
      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",
      "\u201cGood governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy,\" Libowitz said. \"We will continue to do our work to ensure Americans have an ethical and accountable government.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Taking a mental health leave from work is becoming more of an option for people in the United States even thought most of them probably don't know it",
      "NEW YORK -- Her first panic attack came at a company-wide meeting, right before her scheduled presentation. Carolina Lasso had given many similar talks about her marketing team's accomplishments. When her name was called this time, she couldn\u2019t speak.",
      "\u201cI felt a knot in my throat,\u201d Lasso said. \u201cMy head, it felt like it was inside a bubble. I couldn\u2019t hear, I couldn\u2019t see, and it felt like an eternity. It was just a few seconds, but it was so profound, and in a way earth-shattering to me.\u201d",
      "Lasso was struggling after a cross-country move followed by a divorce. Her boss suggested a mental health leave, a possibility she didn\u2019t know existed. She worried whether taking time off would affect how her team viewed her or cost her a future promotion, but in the end she did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful for that opportunity to take the time to heal,\" Lasso, 43, said. \u201cMany people feel guilty when they take a leave of absence when it\u2019s mental health-related. ... There is some extra weight that we carry on our shoulders, as if it had been our fault.\u201d",
      "Despite a fear of repercussions, more adults are recognizing that stepping back from work to deal with emotional burdens or psychological conditions that get in the way of their lives is a necessary choice, one that a growing number of employers recognize.",
      "ComPsych Corp., a provider of employee mental health programs and absence management services, encourages its business clients to make the well-being of workers a priority before individuals get to a breaking point while also having processes in place for those who require leaves of absence.",
      "\u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, collectively we\u2019ve just been in this constant state of turmoil,\u201d Jennifer Birdsall, the senior clinical director at ComPysch, said. \u201cWe just have had this barrage of change and uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorder, which involves excessive reactions to stress, were the top three diagnoses of employees who took mental health leaves in the past two years among clients of Alight, a Chicago-based technology company which administers leaves and benefits for large employers.",
      "A mental health leave can last weeks or months. In some cases, workers get approval to work a reduced schedule or to take short periods of time off when needed, using an approach called \u201cintermittent leave.\u201d",
      "At most U.S. organizations with 50 or more employees, people can request leaves through the Family and Medical Leave Act. The federal law entitles workers with serious health conditions to paid or unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks, depending on state and local laws.",
      "Some employers require people to use sick days or accumulated vacation days to continue receiving a paycheck while out. For longer leaves, workers can access short-term disability plans, if their employer offers one.",
      "Lasso's leave lasted six months, and included therapy and travel to India for additional treatment. She returned to her job but decided after a year to leave for good. She later launched a business to train people on fostering a more humane work culture.",
      "A mental health leave is \u201cnot only OK, but it can really unlock new possibilities once we have the time to do the work \u2014 therapy, medication, whatever it is \u2014 and have enough distance from work to be able to reconnect with ourselves,\u201d Lasso said.",
      "A social stigma around mental health challenges causes many people to avoid seeking treatment or requesting a leave of absence. Newton Cheng, director of health and performance at Google, hopes to change that by sharing his own struggles.",
      "His first self-disclosure happened during the pandemic, when a senior manager invited employees at a meeting to share how they were doing. When it was his turn, Cheng started crying.",
      "He explained he was struggling to live up to his expectations of himself as a father and didn't know how to turn things around.",
      "\u201cIt was just totally horrifying to me because, one, I had just cried in front of my coworkers and I was definitely taught as a professional \u2014 and as a man \u2014 you do not do that,\" Cheng recalled. \"And then two, I had never really articulated and said out loud those words. I hadn\u2019t even allowed myself to think that. But now they\u2019re out there and I had to face them.\u201d",
      "Colleagues responded by relaying their own struggles, but Cheng's difficulties continued. By February 2021, he couldn't get out of bed because he felt paralyzed by dread, he said. A therapist said he was showing symptoms of major depression and anxiety.",
      "\u201cI just realized, \u2018I\u2019m struggling a lot and this goes pretty deep. I don\u2019t think I can keep just putting duct tape on this. I probably need to take some leave,\u2019\u201d Cheng recalled.",
      "Hoping his decision would benefit others, he announced to 200 people at a conference that he planned to take mental health leave. Instead of derailing the gathering as he feared, his honesty inspired fellow conference attendees to open up.",
      "\"It was like a fireworks show,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe he did that.\u2019 Then they forgot about me. But the tone was set. It was like \u2019Oh, this is what we\u2019re doing. Let me talk about what\u2019s going on with me, too.'\u201d",
      "While balancing classes and a full-time job during her last year of college, Rosalie Mae began struggling to get out of bed and crying uncontrollably. Yet she felt like she had \u201cto keep it together\u201d to avoid burdening her colleagues at the University of Utah bookstore, where Mae worked as an accounting clerk.",
      "Then she found herself calling a suicide hotline. \u201cOnce it reached that point, I knew, especially at the urging of my husband, we need to do something more,\u201d Mae, 24, said.",
      "In her case, that meant taking a five-week work leave to put her own health and well-being first. She recommends the same for others who find themselves in a similar position.",
      "\u201cTaking a mental health leave is not necessarily a cure-all, but it is important to give yourself a break and allow yourself to regroup, make a plan of how to proceed and take the steps to work towards feeling better,\" Mae said.",
      "Before broaching the subject of a mental health leave with a manager, consider the workplace culture and the strength of your professional relationships, Cheng said. He recalls saying, \u201cFor my health and well-being, and the sake of my family and what's best for the business, the least risky thing for me to do is to go on leave soon.\u201d",
      "Individuals who suspect an unsympathetic reception can simply say, \u201cI need to go on medical leave. I need time to recover,\u201d he advised.",
      "There's also no legal or ethical requirement to tell everyone you work with the nature of your leave.",
      "\u201cYour coworkers don't need to know why,\u201d said Seth Turner, co-founder of AbsenceSoft, a leave and accommodation management solutions provider. \u201cThey just need to know, 'I\u2019m going to be here at this time, and I'm going to be gone at this time, and I'll be back.'\u201d",

      "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition",
      "LONDON -- In a judgment with far-reaching implications, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition.",
      "The ruling was cheered by some feminists who have campaigned to safeguard rights for women on the basis of biological sex. Trans rights campaigners were disappointed, and worry about the ruling's implications for transgender women.",
      "The court was asked to determine the definition of a woman under Britain\u2019s 2010 Equality Act, which sets out protections against discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion and other traits.",
      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament calling for 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. Its definition of women included trans women whose gender is legally affirmed with a Gender Recognition Certificate.",
      "A feminist group, For Women Scotland, challenged that in court, saying the Scottish government had overstepped its powers by effectively redefining the meaning of \u201cwoman.\u201d",
      "The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the Supreme Court, which held hearings in November.",
      "Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that \u201cthe terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman.\u201d",
      "In the law, \u201cthe words \u2018sex,\u2019 \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 \u2026 mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The judges argued that a broader definition that includes transgender people would make the Equality Act \u201cincoherent and unworkable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the (Equality Act) should apply to these complex, heterogenous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of (biological) women and girls (or men and boys) with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The ruling makes no mention of intersex people, who also are not explicitly protected under the Equality Act.",
      "As in other countries, the issue has polarized opinion, pitting transgender rights campaigners against \u201cgender critical\u201d feminists, who argue that trans women's rights should not come at the expense of those who are born biologically female.",
      "For Women Scotland said it was \u201cabsolutely jubilant\u201d at the ruling. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling, a prominent supporter of the group, said the court victory had \u201cprotected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.\u201d",
      "But LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said there is \u201cdeep concern\u201d surrounding the ruling's consequences.",
      "Vic Valentine, manager of the group Scottish Trans, said the judgment \u201cseems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International U.K. described the ruling as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but said it is \u201cimportant to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court judges stressed that their ruling should not be seen as an attack on transgender people. They said it \u201cdoes not remove or diminish the important protections \u2026 for trans people\u201d under the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender people.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what the ruling will mean in practice.",
      "The judgment highlights a range of spaces and services that could be intended just for women, including \u201crape or domestic violence counselling, domestic violence refuges, rape crisis centers, female-only hospital wards and changing rooms.\u201d The law already allowed for trans women to be excluded from single-sex spaces under certain circumstances, but Wednesday\u2019s ruling appears to make such a ban easier.",
      "The ruling could also see transgender female athletes excluded from participating in women\u2019s and girls sports, and there could also be ramifications in workplaces.",
      "But much depends on how the ruling is interpreted and implemented.",
      "Hannah Ford, an employment partner at law firm Stevens & Bolton, told the BBC that because of the ruling, ensuring workplaces are welcoming places for trans people will be \u201can uphill battle.\u201d",
      "She said one positive aspect was that \u201cat least we have simplicity and clarity. So it is in one sense a triumph of sense over legal incoherency and legal fiction.\u201d",

      "The liver is the only organ that can regenerate, but the question is whether having the pig's liver filter the patient's blood for several days could give it that chance.",
      "In experiments with four deceased bodies, that \u201cbridge\u201d attempt showed the pig liver could support some functions of a human liver for two or three days, said Mike Curtis, CEO of Massachusetts-based eGenesis, which genetically modifies pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "The trial will enroll up to 20 patients in intensive-care units who don't qualify a liver transplant, he said. A device made by Britain\u2019s OrganOx, currently used to preserve donated human livers, will pump participants' blood through the pig liver.",
      "It\u2019s the latest step in attempts to use gene-edited pig organs to save human lives. Pig kidneys from eGenesis and another pig producer, United Therapeutics, are being used in experimental transplants.",

      "A new study has found that fewer people crossed state lines for abortions in 2024 than the previous year",
      "Fewer people crossed state lines to obtain abortions in 2024 than a year earlier, a new survey has found.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, estimates in a report released Tuesday that the overall number of clinician-provided abortions in states where it's legal rose by less than 1% from 2023 to 2024.",
      "But the number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped by about 9%.",
      "The report, based on a monthly survey of providers, is the latest look at how the abortion landscape in the U.S. has evolved since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022 in a ruling that eliminated a national constitutional right to abortion and opened the door to state bans and restrictions.",
      "Guttmacher estimates there were 1.04 million abortions in 2024, up about 1% from its total the previous year.",
      "Multiple studies have found that the total number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since Dobbs, despite some states implementing bans.",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Guttmacher's tally does not capture self-managed abortions such as people obtaining abortion pills from community networks, foreign pharmacies or through telehealth from medical providers in states that have laws intended to protect those who send pills into places with bans. There\u2019s a court battle over the constitutionality of such laws. But another survey found that the number of telehealth pills being sent into states with bans has been growing and accounted for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S. by the summer of 2024.",
      "Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher, said even though the number of abortions is up, it's likely some people who would like to end their pregnancies are not able to.",
      "\u201cWe know that some people are accessing abortion through telehealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know it\u2019s not an option for everybody.\u201d",
      "The number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped to about 155,000 from nearly 170,000.",
      "The year-to-year impact varies by state.",
      "For instance, about 1 in 8 abortions in Florida in the first half of 2023 were provided to people coming from out of state. By the second half of 2024 \u2014 when a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect \u2014 only about 1 in 50 were for people from another state.",
      "More people traveled to states including Virginia and New York after the Florida law took hold.",
      "A drop in people traveling to Minnesota could be linked to abortions being offered again in clinics in Wisconsin.",
      "Most abortions in Kansas are provided to people from elsewhere and the number grew as clinic capacity expanded.",
      "A working paper released in March provided different insight into the impact of the bans.",
      "It found that birth rates rose from 2020 to 2023 in counties farther from abortion clinics. Rates rose faster for Black and Hispanic women, those with lower education levels, and people who are unmarried.",
      "\u201cThe takeaway is that distance still matters,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economic professor and one of the authors of the working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t obvious that that would be the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese bans are more than just policies; these are direct attacks on bodily autonomy,\" said Regina Davis Moss, president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda.",
      "The bans also exacerbate the huge disparities in maternal mortality for Black women in the U.S, she said. Black women died around the time of childbirth at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be faced with increasing numbers of births, which is going to increase the maternal mortality rate, the infant mortality rate and inequities in care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very upsetting and sad.\u201d",
      "Bree Wallace, director of case management at the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund in Florida, which helps with the logistics and costs of abortions, said people who consider getting an abortion don\u2019t always know their options.",
      "\u201cMany people don\u2019t know their choices or think that it\u2019s just not possible to go out of state,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people hear \u2018ban\u2019 or \u2018six-week ban\u2019 in their state and that\u2019s it.\u201d",

      "An Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis shows one in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours",
      "AURORA, Ill. -- At her mother\u2019s home in Illinois, Tracy Balhan flips through photos of her dad, Bill Speer. In one picture, he\u2019s smiling in front of a bucket of sweating beers and wearing a blue T-shirt that reads, \u201cPops. The man. The myth. The legend.\u201d",
      "Balhan\u2019s father died last year after struggling with dementia. During one episode late in his life, he became so agitated that he tried to exit a moving car. Balhan recalls her dad \u2014 larger than life, steady and loving \u2014 yelling at the top of his lungs.",
      "His geriatric psychiatrist recommended she take him to the emergency room at Endeavor Health\u2019s Edward Hospital in the Chicago suburb of Naperville because of its connection to an inpatient behavioral care unit. She hoped it would help get him a quick referral.",
      "But Speer spent 12 hours in the emergency room \u2014 at one point restrained by staff \u2014 waiting for a psych evaluation. Balhan didn\u2019t know it then, but her dad\u2019s experience at the hospital is so common it has a name: ER boarding.",
      "One in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours, according to an Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis. Fifty percent of the patients who were boarded for any length of time were 65 and older, the analysis showed.",
      "Some people who aren\u2019t in the middle of a life-threatening emergency might even wait weeks, health care experts said.",
      "ER boarding is a symptom of the U.S. health care system\u2019s struggles, including shrinking points of entry for patients seeking care outside of ERs and hospitals prioritizing beds for procedures insurance companies often pay more for.",
      "Experts also warn the boarding issue will worsen as the number of people 65 and older in the U.S. with dementia grows in the coming decades. Hospital bed capacity in the U.S. may not keep up. Between 2003 and 2023, the number of staffed hospital beds was static, even as emergency department visits shot up 30% to 40% over that same period.",
      "For older people with dementia, boarding can be especially dangerous, Chicago-based geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Shafi Siddiqui said. One research letter published in June 2024 in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 200,000 patients and found long ER stays could be linked to a higher risk of dementia patients developing delirium \u2014 a temporary state of mental confusion and sometimes hallucinations.",
      "\u201cPeople need to be enraged about (boarding),\u201d said Dr. Vicki Norton, president-elect of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.",
      "National emergency physician groups have lobbied for years to keep boarding under control. While they\u2019ve made some progress, nothing substantial has changed, despite concerns that it leads to worse patient outcomes.",
      "Dr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that\u2019s because boarding is a failing of the entire health care system that manifests in the ER, so solving it demands a systemic approach.",
      "Federal and state policy decisions made nearly 40 years ago limited the number of hospital beds, said Arjun Venkatesh, who studies emergency medicine at Yale. People are now living longer, he said, resulting in more complicated illnesses.",
      "In 2003, there were 965,000 staffed hospital beds compared to 913,000 in 2023, according to the American Hospital Association. And another JAMA research letter published in February shows there are 16% fewer staffed beds in the U.S. post-pandemic.",
      "The ones available may be prioritized for \u201cscheduled care\u201d patients who need non-urgent procedures, like cancer care or orthopedic surgeries. Insurance companies pay hospitals more for those surgeries, Haddock said, so hospitals aren\u2019t likely to move patients into those beds \u2014 even as emergency rooms fill up.",
      "Though long stays in the emergency department are common, there isn\u2019t good data that tracks the extremes, emergency medicine experts said.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently ended a requirement that hospitals track the \u201cmedian\u201d wait times in their emergency departments. An advisory group that develops quality measures for CMS recommended that the agency try to more accurately capture long emergency department stays. That measure has recently been submitted to CMS, which can choose to adopt it.",
      "Patients\u2019 families worry that long emergency room stays may make things worse for their loved ones, forcing some to search for limited alternatives to turn for support and care.",
      "Nancy Fregeau lives in Kankakee, Illinois, with her husband Michael Reeman, who has dementia.",
      "Last year, she said he visited the Riverside Medical Center emergency department several times, often staying more than four hours and in one case more than 10, before finally getting access to a behavioral care bed. Riverside declined to comment on Reeman\u2019s case.",
      "During long waits, Fregeau doesn\u2019t know what reassurance she can offer her husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for anyone to be in the ER but I cannot imagine someone with dementia being in there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just kept saying \u2018When am I going? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d",
      "Since November, Reeman has been going to the MCA Senior Adult Day Center in Kankakee. Fregeau said Reeman treats the day center like it\u2019s his job, offering to vacuum and clean, but comes home happier after having time around other people and away from the house.",
      "In Illinois, there are fewer adult day centers than there are counties, and other resources for people with dementia are shrinking, too. A report from the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living found that 1,000 nursing homes in the U.S. closed between 2015 and 2022. At least 15 behavioral health centers, which are facilities that specialize in treating mental health issues, closed in 2023.",
      "With fewer places for patients to go after being discharged, hospital beds are being used for longer, exacerbating the boarding problem. It\u2019s becoming more difficult to get a specialty hospital bed, especially when patients\u2019 dementia causes aggression.",
      "That was the case for Balhan\u2019s father, who became increasingly agitated during his ER stay. Hospital staff told Balhan the behavioral care unit wasn\u2019t taking dementia patients, so Speer was stuck in the ER for 24 hours until they found a behavioral health facility, separate from the health system, that would take him.",
      "While the hospital couldn\u2019t comment on Speer\u2019s specific situation, Endeavor Health spokesperson Spencer Walrath said its behavioral care unit typically admits geriatric psychiatry patients, including those with dementia, but it depends on factors like bed availability and the patient\u2019s specific medical needs.",
      "Balhan feels that the U.S. health care system failed to treat her dad as a human being.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t feel to me like he was being treated with any dignity as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything could change, that would be the change that I would want to see.\"",

    "story": [
      "Even though cardinals don\u2019t campaign for the job, there are always front-runners going into a conclave to choose the next pope",
      "VATICAN CITY -- A popular saying in Vatican circles is that if you \u201center a conclave as pope, you leave as a cardinal.\u201d",
      "It implies the sacred and secretive process is no popularity contest or campaign, but rather the divinely inspired election of Christ\u2019s Vicar on Earth by the princes of the church.",
      "Still, there are always front-runners, known as \u201cpapabile,\u201d who have at least some of the qualities considered necessary to be pope \u2014 much like those depicted in last year's Oscar-nominated film \u201cConclave.\u201d",
      "Any baptized Catholic male is eligible, though only cardinals have been selected since 1378. The winner must receive at least two-thirds of the vote from those cardinals under age 80 and thus eligible to participate. Pope Francis, who died Monday, appointed the vast majority of electors, often tapping men who share his pastoral priorities, which suggests continuity rather than rupture.",
      "Anyone trying to handicap the outcome should remember that Jorge Mario Bergoglio was considered too old to be elected pope in 2013 at age 76, and that Karol Wojtyla wasn\u2019t on any front-runner lists going into the 1978 conclave that elected him Pope John Paul II.",
      "Some possible candidates:",
      "Erdo, 72, the archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary, was twice elected head of the Council of European Episcopal Conferences, in 2005 and 2011, suggesting he enjoys the esteem of European cardinals who make up the biggest voting bloc of electors. In that capacity, Erdo got to know many African cardinals because the council hosts regular sessions with African bishops\u2019 conferences. Erdo had even more exposure when he helped organize Francis\u2019 2014 and 2015 Vatican meetings on the family and delivered key speeches, as well as during papal visits to Budapest in 2021 and 2023.",
      "Marx, 71, the archbishop of Munich and Freising, was chosen by Francis as a key adviser in 2013. Marx later was named to head the council overseeing Vatican finances during reforms and belt-tightening. The former president of the German bishops\u2019 conference was a strong proponent of the controversial \u201csynodal path\u201d process of dialogue in the German church that began in 2020 as a response to the clergy sexual abuse scandal there. As a result, he is viewed with skepticism by conservatives who considered the process a threat to church unity, given it involved debating issues such as celibacy, homosexuality and women\u2019s ordination. Marx made headlines in 2021 when he dramatically offered to resign as archbishop to atone for the German church\u2019s dreadful abuse record, but Francis quickly rejected the resignation and told him to stay.",
      "Ouellet, 80, of Canada, led the Vatican\u2019s influential bishops office for over a decade, overseeing the key clearinghouse for potential candidates to head dioceses around the world. Francis kept Ouellet in the job until 2023, even though he was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, and thus helped select the more doctrinaire bishops preferred by the German pontiff. Considered more of a conservative than Francis, Ouellet still selected pastorally minded bishops to reflect Francis\u2019 belief that bishops should \u201csmell like the sheep\u201d of their flock. Ouellet defended priestly celibacy for the Latin Rite church and upheld the ban on women\u2019s ordination but called for women to have a greater role in church governance. He has good contacts with the Latin American church, having headed the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Commission for Latin America for over a decade. Since 2019, his office has taken charge of investigating bishops accused of covering up for predator priests, a job that would have made him no friends among those sanctioned but also could have given him lots of otherwise confidential and possibly compromising information about fellow cardinals.",
      "Parolin, 70, of Italy, has been Francis\u2019 secretary of state since 2014 and is considered one of the main contenders to be pope, given his prominence in the Catholic hierarchy. The veteran diplomat oversaw the Holy See\u2019s controversial deal with China over bishop nominations and was involved -- but not charged -- in the Vatican\u2019s botched investment in a London real estate venture that led to a 2021 trial of another cardinal and nine others. A former ambassador to Venezuela, Parolin knows the Latin American church well. He would be seen as someone who would continue in Francis\u2019 tradition but as a more sober and timid diplomatic insider, returning an Italian to the papacy after three successive outsiders: St. John Paul II (Poland); Benedict (Germany) and Francis (Argentina). But while Parolin has managed the Vatican bureaucracy, he has no real pastoral experience. His ties to the London scandal, in which his office lost of tens of millions of dollars to bad deals and shady businessmen, could count against him.",
      "The idea of an American pope has long been taboo, given the geopolitical power already wielded by the United States. But the Chicago-born Prevost, 69, could be a first. He has extensive experience in Peru, first as a missionary and then an archbishop, and he is currently prefect of the Vatican\u2019s powerful dicastery for bishops, in charge of vetting nominations for bishops around the world. Francis clearly had an eye on him for years and sent him to run the diocese of Chiclayo, Peru, in 2014. He held that position until 2023, when Francis brought him to Rome for his current role. Prevost is also president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, a job that keeps him in regular contact with the Catholic hierarchy in the part of the world that still counts the most Catholics. In addition to his nationality, Prevost\u2019s comparative youth could count against him if his brother cardinals don\u2019t want to commit to a pope who might reign for another two decades.",
      "Sarah, 79, of Guinea, the retired head of the Vatican\u2019s liturgy office, was long considered the best hope for an African pope. Beloved by conservatives, Sarah would signal a return to the doctrinaire and liturgically minded papacies of John Paul II and Benedict. Sarah, who had previously headed the Vatican\u2019s charity office Cor Unum, clashed on several occasions with Francis, none more seriously than when he and Benedict co-authored a book advocating the \u201cnecessity\u201d of continued celibacy for Latin Rite priests. The book came out as Francis was weighing whether to allow married priests in the Amazon to address a priest shortage there. The implication was that Sarah had manipulated Benedict into lending his name and moral authority to a book that had all the appearances of being a counterweight to the Francis' own teaching. Francis dismissed Benedict\u2019s secretary and several months later retired Sarah after he turned 75. Even Sarah\u2019s supporters lamented the episode hurt his papal chances.",
      "Schoenborn, 80, the archbishop of Vienna, Austria, was a student of Benedict's, and thus on paper seems to have the doctrinaire academic chops to appeal to conservatives. However, he became associated with one of Francis\u2019 most controversial moves by defending his outreach to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics as an \u201corganic development of doctrine,\u201d not the rupture that some conservatives contended. Schoenborn\u2019s parents divorced when he was a teen, so the issue is personal. He also took heat from the Vatican when he criticized its past refusal to sanction high-ranking sexual abusers, including his predecessor as archbishop of Vienna. Schoenborn has expressed support for civil unions and women as deacons, and was instrumental in editing the 1992 update of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the handbook of the church\u2019s teaching that Benedict had spearheaded when he headed the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office.",
      "Tagle, 67, of the Philippines, would appear to be Francis\u2019 pick for the first Asian pope. Francis brought the popular archbishop of Manila to Rome to head the Vatican\u2019s missionary evangelization office, which serves the needs of the Catholic Church in much of Asia and Africa. His role took on greater weight when Francis reformed the Vatican bureaucracy and raised the importance of his evangelization office. Tagle often cites his Chinese lineage \u2013 his maternal grandmother was part of a Chinese family that moved to the Philippines -- and he is known for becoming emotional when discussing his childhood. Though he has pastoral, Vatican and management experience -- he headed the Vatican\u2019s Caritas Internationalis federation of charity groups before coming to Rome permanently -- Tagle would be on the young side to be elected pope for life, with cardinals perhaps preferring an older candidate whose papacy would be more limited.",
      "Zuppi, 69, the archbishop of Bologna and president of the Italian bishops conference, elected in 2022, is closely affiliated with the Sant\u2019Egidio Community, a Rome-based Catholic charity that was influential under Francis, particularly in interfaith dialogue. Zuppi was part of Sant\u2019Egidio\u2019s team that helped negotiate the end of Mozambique\u2019s civil war in the 1990s and was named Francis' peace envoy for Russia's war in Ukraine. Francis made him a cardinal in 2019 and later made clear he wanted him in charge of Italy\u2019s bishops, a sign of his admiration for the prelate who, like Francis, is known as a \u201cstreet priest.\u201d In another sign of his progressive leanings and closeness to Francis, Zuppi wrote the introduction to the Italian edition of \u201cBuilding a Bridge,\u201d by the Rev. James Martin, an American Jesuit, about the church\u2019s need to improve its outreach to the LGBTQ+ community. Zuppi would be a candidate in Francis\u2019 tradition of ministering to those on the margins, although his relative youth would count against him for cardinals seeking a short papacy. His family had strong institutional ties: Zuppi\u2019s father worked for the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano, and his mother was the niece of Cardinal Carlo Confalonieri, dean of the College of Cardinals in the 1960s and 1970s.",

      "A Thai-Chinese company has denied allegations its steel rods did not pass safety standard tests after nationwide criticism prompted an investigation into the collapse of a high-rise building under construction after an earthquake last month in Bangkok",
      "BANGKOK -- A Thai-Chinese company denied Monday allegations its steel rods did not pass safety standard tests after nationwide criticism prompted an investigation into the collapse of a high-rise building under construction after an earthquake last month in Bangkok.",
      "Authorities are probing Xin Ke Yuan Steel and another Chinese contractor involved in the construction to find out why the building crumbled following a quake centered in Myanmar, more than 800 miles (1,200 kilometers) away. It was the only building that completely collapsed that day.",
      "The 7.7 magnitude quake on March 28 killed more than 3,700 in Myanmar, while in Thailand, 47 were killed, mostly at the collapse site, and 47 others went missing.",
      "The collapse sparked questions about the enforcement of construction safety and the state-run Chinese contractor, China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group, leading to the arrest Saturday of its Chinese executive in Thailand, identified as Zhang, on suspicion of operating the business through the use of nominees.",
      "Foreigners can operate a business in Thailand, but it must be a joint venture with a Thai partner, and they cannot own more than 49% to protect local competitiveness.",
      "Three Thai shareholders of the company are also wanted on suspicion of being the nominees, said officials of the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand\u2019s equivalent of the FBI. They also said they were looking into the quality of the construction material and whether the company illegally fixed its bidding.",
      "The company posted a video online last year advertising the building, meant to be a new office of the State Audit Office, with plenty of drone footage and boasting about the quality of the design, construction and management of the project.",
      "Last week, a Thai engineer filed a police complaint saying that his name and signature were forged as a project controller in one of the construction plans. He denied any involvement in the project.",
      "Xin Ke Yuan Steel, also partly owned by Chinese nationals, came under scrutiny over the quality of the steel rods they provided for the buildings. Its operating license is currently suspended following a fatal fire accident in December at its factory in Rayong province.",
      "Industry Minister Akanat Promphan said two types of steel rods found at the collapse site did not pass safety standards and that Xin Ke Yuan supplied both. He raided the company\u2019s factory on April 11 for evidence, saying that samples of the steel products confiscated by authorities following its December suspension have already failed two tests.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at the age of 88. Here are the key things to know about the death of the Argentine pontiff, history's first from Latin America, who presided over the Catholic Church for more than 12 years.",
      "The death of Francis was announced by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Irish-born Vatican camerlengo, a position that will be important in the coming weeks as he takes charge of the administration of the Holy See until a new pope is elected.",
      "\u201cAt 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father,\" Farrell said. \u201cHis entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church.\u201d",
      "The pontiff died in the Vatican\u2019s Domus Santa Marta, where he returned less than a month ago after being hospitalized for double pneumonia.",
      "Francis made his final public appearance a day earlier on Easter Sunday, though he had delegated the celebration of the Easter Mass to another cardinal.",
      "He blessed a crowd of faithful from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica. \u201cBrothers and sisters, Happy Easter,\u201d he said from the same loggia where Jorge Mario Bergoglio was introduced to the world on March 13, 2013 as the 266th pope.",
      "Francis also made a surprise ride in the square in his popemobile, drawing wild cheers and applause.",
      "Beforehand, he met briefly with U.S. Vice President JD Vance.",
      "\u201cI was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill,\" Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, said on Monday during a visit to India.",
      "Even before the great bells of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica began tolling to mark Francis\u2019 death, messages of tribute began pouring in from across the world.",
      "Catholic and non-Catholic leaders alike honored a spiritual leader who was a voice for the marginalized and the weak, for migrants and LGBTQ+ people, and who showed concern for nature.",
      "He \u201ccared about the great global challenges of our time \u2014 migration, climate change, inequalities, peace \u2014 as well as the everyday struggles of the one and all,\u201d European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa said.",
      "The outgoing German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said that the world had lost \"an advocate for the weak, a reconciling and a warm-hearted person.\u201d",
      "Other religious leaders also praised him for seeking dialogue. The head of the Church of England remembered him for his commitment to improving relations among the world\u2019s religions, while Rome's chief rabbi described Francis' pontificate as an important new chapter in relations between Judaism and Catholicism.",
      "Francis, who suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli hospital in Rome on Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there, the longest hospitalization of his papacy.",
      "For the faithful, those were weeks of fear that his illness could be fatal or lead to another papal resignation after that of Pope Benedict XVI, a surprise move that led to the election of Francis.",
      "The pontiff's return to the Vatican on March 23 brought relief to many at the time.",
      "Francis' death now sets off a weekslong process of allowing the faithful to pay their final respects, first for Vatican officials in the Santa Marta chapel and then in St. Peter\u2019s for the general public.",
      "That will be followed by a funeral to be celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, and a conclave to elect a new pope.",

Zelenskyy said that Russian forces carried out 96 assault operations along the front line, shelled Ukrainian positions more than 1,800 times and used hundreds of drones during the course of the ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThe nature of Ukrainian actions will continue to be mirror-like: we will respond to silence with silence, and our blows will be a defense against Russian blows. Actions always speak louder than words,\u201d he said.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- The death of a pope starts a centuries-old ritual involving sacred oaths by the cardinals electing a successor, the piercing of ballots with a needle and thread after they're counted, and then burning them to produce either the white or black smoke to signal if there's a new leader for the world's 1.3 billion Catholics.",
      "The election itself is shrouded in secrecy, with cardinals forbidden from communicating with the outside world what happened during the voting in the conclave behind the frescoed walls of the Sistine Chapel.",
      "St. John Paul II rewrote the regulations on papal elections in a 1996 document that remains largely in force, though Pope Benedict XVI amended it twice before he resigned. Here is what happens when a pope dies, a period known as the \u201csede vacante,\u201d or the \u201cvacant See.\u201d",
      "If the pope has died, the camerlengo, or chamberlain, must certify the death and seal the papal apartment. He runs administrative and financial duties of the Holy See until a new pope takes over.",

      "The dean of the College of Cardinals summons the cardinals for the funeral, presiding at the Mass before the conclave begins. That position is currently held by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the retired head of the Vatican\u2019s office for bishops.",
      "In November 2024, Francis reformed the rites to be used for his funeral, simplifying them to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican. Francis has chosen to be buried in St. Mary Major Basilica, where his favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, the Salus Populi Romani, is located.",
      "The death of a pope begins a precise sequence of events that include the confirmation of death in the pontiff's home, the transfer of the coffin to St. Peter's Basilica for public viewing, a funeral Mass and burial. Interment must take place between the fourth and sixth day after his death.",
      "After the funeral, there are nine days of official mourning, known as the \u201cnovendiali.\u201d",
      "During this period, the cardinals arrive in Rome. To give everyone time to assemble, the conclave must begin 15-20 days after the \u201csede vacante\u201d is declared, although it can start sooner if the cardinals agree.",
      "Only cardinals under age 80 are eligible, and current regulations limit the number of electors to 120. According to the most recently updated Vatican statistics, there were 135 cardinals under age 80 and eligible to vote, though that number may change before the conclave begins.",
      "Those over 80 can\u2019t vote but can participate in pre-conclave meetings, known as general congregations, in which church problems are discussed. It was in these meetings in 2013 that then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke about the need for the church to go to the \u201cexistential peripheries\u201d to find those who suffer \u2014 an off-the-cuff speech that helped his election.",

Each cardinal makes his choice, folds the paper in half, walks to the front of the chapel and declares: \u201cI call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.\u201d",
      "He then puts the ballot on a tray and tips it into a receptacle.",
      "Three designated cardinals, known as scrutineers, check each ballot to see if it is filled out correctly. Each name is read aloud and counted, with the results announced to the conclave after each round.",

Benedict decreed that a two-thirds majority is always needed, no matter how long it takes. He did so to prevent cardinals from holding out for the 12 days foreseen by John Paul and then pushing through a candidate with a slim majority.",
      "Benedict also tightened the oath of secrecy in the conclave, making clear that anyone who reveals what went on inside faces automatic excommunication.",
      "In John Paul\u2019s rules, excommunication was always a possibility, but Benedict revised the oath that liturgical assistants and secretaries take to make it explicit, saying they must observe \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy\u201d and explicitly refrain from using any audio or video recording devices.",

      "Cardinals also are bound by secrecy, although the threat of excommunication only hangs over them explicitly if they are found to have accepted payment for their vote, allowed secular powers to influence it, or entered into pacts with other cardinals to back a candidate.",
      "After the ballots are pierced, they are burned in a cylindrical stove at the end of the voting session. Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney means no decision; white smoke signals the cardinals have chosen a pope and that he has accepted.",

      "The death of a pope sets in motion a series of carefully orchestrated rites and rituals well before the conclave to elect his successor begins",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The death of a pope sets in motion a series of carefully orchestrated rites and rituals well before the conclave to elect his successor begins. They involve the certification of death and public display of his body for the faithful to pay their respects, followed by the funeral and burial.",
      "Pope Francis, who died on Monday, revised various rites last year, simplifying the funeral rituals to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes. But the core elements remain, including the three key moments that must be observed between the death of a pope and his burial.",
      "The reforms are incorporated into the slim red volume \u201cOrdo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis,\u201d Latin for \u201cRite of Burial for Roman Pontiffs.\u201d",
      "While popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that elects their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites hadn\u2019t been undertaken since 2000.",
      "The changes became necessary after Francis expressed his own wishes, and after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on Dec. 31, 2022. For Benedict, the Vatican had to work out the novelty of a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years.",
      "A few months later, Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican\u2019s master of liturgical ceremonies, Archbishop Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the entire book of rites to simplify them.",
      "In explaining the reforms, Ravelli said the changes aimed \u201cto emphasize even more that the Roman Pontiff\u2019s funeral is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world.\u201d",
      "The three main stations, or moments, occur first in his home, then in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and then in the place of burial.",
      "The reform allows for the formal confirmation of death to occur in Francis\u2019 personal chapel rather than his bedroom. It is unclear why, the change may be more practical than anything since Francis chose to live in a small suite in the Vatican\u2019s Santa Marta hotel rather than the Apostolic Palace. He has a personal chapel at Santa Marta.",
      "Upon the pope\u2019s death, the head of the Vatican health service examines the body, ascertains the cause of death and writes a report. The body is dressed in white.",
      "The body rests in the pope\u2019s personal chapel for the ritual pronouncement of death, presided over by the camerlengo, the Vatican official who runs the Holy See administration between the death or resignation of one pope and the election of another. The camerlengo is American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, one of Francis\u2019 most trusted aides.",
      "In a change from the past, the rite no longer requires the body to be placed in the traditional three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak. Now, the pope\u2019s body is placed in a wooden coffin, with a zinc coffin inside. The pope is dressed in red liturgical vestments, his miter \u2014 the traditional headdress of bishops \u2014 and the pallium woolen stole, a kind of scarf. The Pasqual candle, a large, decorated candle used at Easter, is placed nearby.",
      "The camerlengo drafts the formal declaration of death, attaching the certificate that had been prepared by the health service chief.",
      "The master of liturgical celebrations, Ravelli, then decides when other faithful can pay their respects before the coffin is moved to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing.",
      "When the body is brought into the basilica, the Litany of Saints chant is sung. The camerlengo leads the procession.",
      "In another change, the pope\u2019s body is no longer placed on an elevated bier. Rather, the simplified wooden coffin is placed facing the pews, with the Pasqual candle nearby.",
      "The night before the funeral, the camerlengo presides over the closing and sealing of the coffin, in the presence of other senior cardinals. A white cloth is placed over the pope\u2019s face.",
      "A bag containing coins minted during his papacy is placed in the coffin along with a one-page written account of his papacy \u2014 known in Italian as a \"rogito,\" a word indicating an official deed. It is read aloud by the master of liturgical ceremonies and then rolled up and slipped inside a cylindrical tube that is placed inside the coffin. Another copy is kept in the Vatican archives. The covers of both the zinc coffin and the wooden one bear a cross and the papal coat of arms.",
      "Francis\u2019 coat of arms, which he kept from when he was bishop, features a shield and the monogram of his Jesuit order, with the words \u201cMiserando atque eligendo,\u201d Latin for \u201cHaving had mercy, he called him.\u201d It comes from an episode in the Gospel where Christ picks a seemingly unworthy person to follow him.",
      "The funeral is presided over by the dean of the College of Cardinals or, if that is not possible, by the vice dean or another senior cardinal. The current dean is Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91. The vice dean is Argentine Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 81. Francis earlier this year extended both of their five-year terms rather than appoint new ones.",
      "Francis\u2019 reform allows for burial outside the Vatican, with the camerlengo presiding. Various seals are impressed on the coffin, and it is placed inside the tomb.",
      "Francis has said he wants to be buried not in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica or its grottoes, where most popes are buried, but in the St. Mary Major Basilica across town. His choice reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus Populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).",
      "After every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my great devotion,\u201d Francis told Mexico\u2019s N+ in revealing his future burial plans. \u201cThe place is already prepared.\u201d",
      "With the burial, the Catholic Church begins nine days of official mourning, known as the \u201cnovemdiales\u201d and the conclave begins.",

      "Pope Francis had an informal, lighthearted speaking style",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis, who died on Monday, had an informal, lighthearted speaking style, and sometimes he even created words in a combination of his native Spanish with the Italian that he spoke as pope.",
      "Some of his memorable quotes:",
      "\u201cBrothers and sisters, good evening!\u201d -- Francis\u2019 first words delivered from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica after his election as pontiff on March 13, 2013.",
      "___",
      "\u201cWhen the votes reached two-thirds, there was the usual applause, because the pope had been elected. And he gave me a hug and a kiss and said: \u2018Don\u2019t forget the poor!\u2019 And those words came to me: the poor, the poor. Then, right away, thinking of the poor, I thought of Francis of Assisi. Then I thought of all the wars, as the votes were still being counted, till the end. Francis is also the man of peace. That is how the name came into my heart: Francis of Assisi. \u2026 How I would like a Church which is poor and for the poor!\u201d \u2014 Francis, speaking to journalists on March 16, 2013, recounting how Cardinal Claudio Hummes gave him the idea of choosing the name Francis.",
      "___",
      "\u201cIn these days, I\u2019ve been able to read a book by a cardinal \u2014 Cardinal Kasper, a good theologian \u2014 about mercy. And this book has done me a lot of good, though don\u2019t think I\u2019m just doing publicity for my cardinals\u2019 books! It\u2019s not like that. But it\u2019s done me so much good. Cardinal Kasper said that feeling \u2018mercy,\u2019 this word changes everything. It\u2019s the best thing we can feel: It changes the world. A bit of mercy makes the world less cold and more just.\u201d \u2014 Francis' First Angelus prayer from his studio window, March 17, 2013. ___",

      "\u201cIn certain cases, this can include the help of the sacraments. Hence, \u2018I want to remind priests that the confessional must not be a torture chamber, but rather an encounter with the Lord\u2019s mercy.\u2019 I would also point out that the Eucharist \u2018is not a prize for the perfect, but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak.'\u201d \u2014 Footnote 351 in encyclical \u201cAmoris Laetitia\u201d (\u201cThe Joy of Love\u201d), referencing Francis\u2019 writings about access to the Eucharist, April 8, 2016. ___",

      "Indonesia and China say they have committed to maritime cooperation promoting safety and security in the South China Sea",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Indonesia and China said Monday they committed to maritime cooperation promoting safety and security in the South China Sea, amid longstanding Indonesian suspicions about China's actions in waters controlled by Jakarta.",
      "The sides agreed to cooperate in infrastructure building, minerals development and joint security, the last being the most significant because of Indonesia\u2019s concerns over Chinese development near the Natuna island group in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety.",
      "While neither side mentioned the islands directly, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the officials agreed to further enhance their security cooperation in a comprehensive and sustainable way.",
      "\u201cWe will enhance law enforcement and security cooperation to jointly combat transnational (inaudible) cooperation,\u201d Wang said following the first joint meeting of foreign and defense ministers from the two sides in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe agreed that safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea is in line with the interests of all parties, and we will set up an example in maritime cooperation,\u201d Wang said, adding that the coast guards signed a memorandum of understanding on maritime security and safety.",
      "Indonesia borders the strategic waterway through which an estimated $5 trillion in world trade passes annually, but it is not formally one of the six parties that share overlapping sovereign maritime claims with China. Such disputes have raised fears of a larger conflict that could put China and the U.S. on a collision course.",
      "Despite that, China's southernmost territorial claim lies within Indonesia's 370-kilometer (200-nautical-mile) exclusive economic zone, and Indonesian security patrols routinely drive off or seize Chinese fishing boats, fueling tensions between the countries. Meanwhile, officials in Jakarta are mulling over Beijing's plans for the Natuna island chain, part of which lies inside China\u2019s \u201cnine-dash line,\u201d which it uses to roughly demarcate its claim to most of the South China Sea.",
      "Chinese coast guard ships have escorted fishing vessels \u2014 some of which have been confronted by the Indonesian coast guard \u2014 while Indonesia has increased the number of patrols and size of garrisons on the hundreds of scattered islands.",
      "Last year, during a state visit by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, the sides pledged to \"joint maritime development\" in the area, while having no effect on sovereignty claims, seemingly calming the situation somewhat.",
      "While that appeared to apply mainly to economic opportunities, Chinese Defense Minister Adm. Dong Jun on Monday said the sides had also agreed to boost communication and stage joint counter-terrorism exercises later this year.",
      "The South China Sea, especially its parts lying close to Indonesia, has at times become notorious for piracy in which ships are repainted, renamed and have their electronic identities altered in the countless ports and islands in the archipelago.",
      "Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono and Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin largely echoed the Chinese sides' comments, underscoring their joint desire to smooth over economic and security divisions.",
      "\u201cWe also agreed to stand united against terrorism, violent extremism and cyberthreats and we shared concerns over the threat of transnational crime in the region which increasingly targets our nationals,\u201d said Sugiono, who like many Indonesians uses just one name.",
      "Indonesia is also in the process of establishing a consulate in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu, which has close relations with Southeast Asia, Sugiono said.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s economic ties with China have flourished in recent years. China became Indonesia\u2019s largest trading partner and plowed billions into major infrastructure projects such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway and Cirata, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest floating solar power project, on a reservoir in West Java, 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the capital, Jakarta.",
      "Disagreements have emerged over the pricing and timing for the projects, but China has been determined to follow through on them in keeping with President Xi Jinping's signature \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative to build infrastructure throughout the region.",
      "China's strategy in the South China Sea has been to deal with each claim on an individual basis while avoiding facing a united front, as well as going back on pledges such as not to militarize human-made islands in the area it controls.",

      "Poilievre, a career politician and firebrand populist, has campaigned with Trump-like braggadocio, even taking a page from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president by adopting the slogan \u201cCanada First.\u201d But his similarities to Trump might cost him the chance to become prime minister when Canadians head to the polls on April 28.",
      "Trump\u2019s frequent attacks on Canada\u2019s economy and sovereignty have infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in nationalism that has bolstered Liberal Party poll numbers.",
      "Like Trump, Poilievre brags about the size of the crowd at his campaign rallies and attacks the mainstream media, recently calling a female journalist a protester. In response to the changes in public opinion, some Poilievre supporters wore hoodies to a recent rally with the slogan, \u201cDo you believe the polls?\u201d",
      "The change in the polls has been dramatic. In a mid-January poll by Nanos, the Liberals trailed the Conservatives by 47% to 20%. In the latest Nanos poll, which was conducted during a three-day period that ended April 19, the Liberals led by six percentage points. The January poll had a margin of error 3.1 points while the latest poll had a 2.7-point margin.",
      "\u201cThe Trumpy hectoring of people, the slogans, the big rallies \u2014 like it all just seems like so Trump. And people are not loving Trump right now in Canada,\u201d said Kory Teneycke, a key figure in conservative Canadian politics who directs campaigns.",
      "\u201c(Poilievre's) style and his approach to politics certainly channels a lot of Trump. It\u2019s like a cheap karaoke version of Trump.\"",
      "Poilievre is imploring Canadians not to give the Liberals a fourth term after \u201ca lost Liberal decade.\" He hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined toward the end of his decade in power as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.",
      "But Trump attacked, Trudeau resigned and Mark Carney, a two-time central banker, became Liberal party leader and prime minister. After decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.",
      "Poilievre is best known for his populist slogans and attacks on Trudeau, whom he blamed for high inflation. He was a Cabinet minister in former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s government and has led the opposition Conservatives since 2022.",
      "Teneycke said Poilievre's skill as a \u201cpolitical attack dog\u201d is what led him to great heights.",
      "\"When that ire was focused on a very unpopular prime minister in Justin Trudeau, that was working for him,\" Teneycke said. \u201cExit Trudeau, enter Trump and it\u2019s a totally changed game. He hasn\u2019t brought that level of ferocity to Trump.\"",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Poilievre is different from Trump in quite a few ways but, stylistically, their rhetoric is often similar.",
      "\u201cSounding like someone many of your fellow citizens perceive as their country\u2019s public enemy No. 1 can\u2019t be a good thing in politics,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "A married 45-year-old father of two, Poilievre represents a district outside the capital, Ottawa, but he grew up in Alberta, Canada's most conservative province. He has been a member of Parliament since age 25.",
      "Poilievre volunteered on conservative campaigns during his teenage years, joined the campus conservative club at the University of Calgary and was a finalist for an essay-writing contest about what he would do if he were prime minister.",
      "Trump has said he isn\u2019t concerned that his trade war with Canada was boosting the Liberal Party ahead of the parliamentary elections. And although he said Poilievre's views are more aligned than Carney\u2019s with his own, he's not a fan of Poilievre.",
      "\u201cThe conservative that\u2019s running is stupidly no friend of mine,\u201d Trump has said, criticizing Poilievre for \u201csaying negative things.\u201d",
      "Poilievre, like Carney, said that if he's elected, he would accelerate renegotiations of the free trade deal with the U.S. He also wants Trump to suspend U.S. tariffs during the talks. He said Trump should \u201cknock off\u201d his attacks on Canada, but that, \u201cnobody can control this president.\u201d",
      "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a conservative ally of Poilievre, said Poilievre would be \u201cvery much in sync\u201d with the \u201cnew direction in America.\u201d",
      "Poilievre has vowed to defund the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the public broadcaster and a cultural institution in Canada. He wants to cut taxes and hopes to approve pipelines that would diversify oil exports. He has also promised to be tough on crime and has denounced \u201cwoke-ism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s ready for change in Canada? Who\u2019s ready to ax some taxes? Who\u2019s ready to build some homes? Who\u2019s ready for some pipelines to make us independent from the Americans? And who\u2019s ready to put Canada first for a change?\" Poilievre said at a recent rally.",

      "Mark Carney\u2019s political career is only months old, and it\u2019s already been a roller-coaster ride",
      "TORONTO -- Mark Carney's political career is only months old, and it's already been a roller-coaster ride. The former central banker appeared destined to become one of Canada's shortest-serving prime ministers until President Donald Trump picked a fight with the U.S.'s northern neighbor.",
      "Carney, who was sworn in on March 14 following Justin Trudeau's resignation and a Liberal Party leadership race, now leads in the polls heading into the April 28 parliamentary elections, marking a dramatic turnaround for a party that seemed headed for a crushing defeat until the American president started attacking Canada's economy and sovereignty almost daily.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war and threats to make Canada the 51st state have infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has helped Liberals flip the election narrative. In a mid-January poll by Nanos, Liberals trailed the Conservative Party by 47% to 20%. In the latest Nanos poll, which was conducted during a three-day period that ended April 19, the Liberals led by six percentage points. The January poll had a margin of error 3.1 points while the latest poll had a 2.7-point margin.",
      "\u201cTiming is everything in politics and Carney entered the political arena at a most favorable time,\u201d said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Carney's opponent is Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, a career politician and firebrand populist who has campaigned with Trump-like swagger, even taking a page from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president by adopting the slogan \u201cCanada First.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis election is a test about whether Canada will embrace or reject populism,\" B\u00e9land said, suggesting many voters view Carney as reassuring because of his experience and calm.",
      "\u201cWithout the Trump effect, the Conservatives would probably be in a much stronger position in the polls right now. If Trump wasn\u2019t currently in the White House, it would be hard to imagine the Liberals being the favorites in this federal race, considering how unpopular they were just a few months ago.\u201d",
      "Carney navigated crises when he ran Canada\u2019s central bank and when he later became the first non-U.K. citizen to run the Bank of England since its founding in 1694.",
      "His Bank of England appointment won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.",
      "Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called it \u201cextraordinary\u201d that a country would choose a foreigner to head its central bank, and that it's a mark of how admired Carney is.",
      "\"He is calm and cool in a crisis,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cHe\u2019s a clear thinker and he understands finance cold. He\u2019s very well prepared.\u201d",
      "Carney, 60, is credited with keeping money flowing through the Canadian economy by acting quickly in cutting interest rates to their lowest level ever, working with bankers to sustain lending through the financial crisis and, critically, letting the public know that rates would remain low so they would keep borrowing. He was the first central banker to commit to keeping them at a historic-low level for a definite time \u2014 a step the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow.",
      "Carney also helped manage the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K. Paulson said Carney has the \u201cperfect background\u201d for these challenging times.",
      "\u201cEverything he\u2019s done, he\u2019s excelled at. Every job \u2014 the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who has dealt with him that doesn\u2019t respect him. Whether they agree or disagree with him, they respect him. He\u2019s got a very, very nice manner.\u201d",
      "Both Conservative and Liberal prime ministers tried to make Carney their finance minister, the second-most powerful position in Canada's government. Former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper named Carney the Bank of Canada Governor and later offered to make him finance minister. Trudeau, Carney's Liberal predecessor, long wanted him as his finance minister.",
      "Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.",
      "He was born in Fort Smith, in Canada\u2019s remote Northwest Territories. When he was 6, his family moved to Edmonton, where his mother taught school and his father became a professor of education history at the University of Alberta.",
      "Carney earned a partial scholarship to Harvard University, where he was the backup goalie on the hockey team. Influenced by John Kenneth Galbraith, who pioneered the popular notion that economics should be accessible to the masses, Carney took up economics.",
      "A married father of four, Carney earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Harvard in 1988, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in economics from Oxford University.",
      "Carney has said Canada's close friendship with the U.S. has ended, and he squarely blamed Trump.",
      "Trump mocked Carney\u2019s predecessor by calling him Governor Trudeau. He has not trolled Carney. But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this month that Trump had not changed his position that Canada \u201cwould benefit greatly by becoming the 51st state.\u201d",
      "Carney said the 80-year period when the U.S. embraced the mantle of global economic leadership and forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect is over.",
      "\u201cThere is no going back. We in Canada will have to build a new relationship with the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "If elected, Carney said he would accelerate renegotiations of the free trade deal with the U.S in an effort to end the uncertainty hurting both economies.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is trying to fundamentally restructure the international trading system and in the process he\u2019s rupturing the global economy,\u201d Carney said.",
      "\u201cThe core question is who is going to be at the table for Canada,\u201d he said.",

      "The deaths mark the latest in America\u2019s intensified campaign of strikes targeting the rebels. The U.S. military\u2019s Central Command declined to answer questions about the strike or discuss civilian casualties from its campaign.",
      "The Houthis described the strike as hitting the Farwa neighborhood market in Sanaa\u2019s Shuub district. That area has been targeted before by the Americans.",
      "Footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showed damage to vehicles and buildings in the area, with screaming onlookers holding what appeared to be a dead child. Others wailed on stretchers heading into a hospital",
      "Strikes overnight into Monday also hit other areas of the country, including Yemen's Amran, Hodeida, Marib and Saada governorates.",
      "The strikes come after U.S. airstrikes hit the Ras Isa fuel port in Yemen last week, killing at least 74 people and wounding 171 others.",
      "The strikes follow the resumption of negotiations in Rome between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program, which Washington has linked to its attacks in Yemen.",
      "The U.S. is targeting the Houthis because of the group\u2019s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis are the last militant group in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.",
      "The new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than attacks on the group were under President Joe Biden, an AP review found. The new campaign started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid from entering the Gaza Strip.",
      "From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",
      "Assessing the toll of the month-old U.S. airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn\u2019t released information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",

Residents of town, which sits pressed up next to Mexico\u2019s active Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, prepare for months for the three-day celebration every Easter weekend.",

      "Throughout the years, the tradition grew to take on its own identity, mixing with local Mexican customs like many Easter and Holy Week celebrations across Latin America.",
      "The hats of the sayones, meant to imitate the helmets worn by Roman soldiers, are the dominant part of the celebration, and have gradually grown more elaborate over the past 25 years as residents have sought to out-do each other.",

Every year, residents pick new colors for their costume, from deep yellows and reds, to brilliant pinks and blues.",
      "This year, 20-year-old Eduardo Canizal chose a three-pronged pink and black tissue paper structure, fastened to a black cowboy hat and with a cushion on the back of his neck to support the hat\u2019s weight. Others fasten them onto construction hats or metal wire.",
      "\u201cEvery year, you want to do something bigger, better and you keep going,\u201d he said.",

      "Jimenez, the town\u2019s cultural director, said it\u2019s a celebration the town has clung to as other Easter marches and traditions like Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead have been flooded by tourists, often watering down longtime traditions.",
      "In Tetela, more than a thousand people participated this year, he said, yet the celebration still remains local at its heart.",

      "\u201cThe only reason they are imprisoned is for having opposed you and your electoral fraud,\u201d he wrote to Maduro. \u201cHowever, I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and surrender of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners you hold.\u201d",

      "Bukele said he would ask El Salvador's foreign ministry to be in contact with the Maduro government, which did not immediately respond to the post.",
      "The proposal comes as El Salvador has come under sharp international scrutiny for accepting Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported by the Trump administration, which accused them of being alleged gang members with little evidence. Deportees are locked up in a \u201cmega-prison\u201d know as the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), built by the Bukele government during his crackdown on the country\u2019s gangs.",

      "Several canoes paddle toward Makoko, a vast floating slum built on stilts in the lagoon at one end of Nigeria\u2019s economic hub of Lagos",
      "MAKOKO, Nigeria -- Several canoes paddle toward Makoko, a vast floating slum built on stilts in the lagoon at one end of Nigeria\u2019s economic hub of Lagos. Riding on the vessels are giant cardboard puppet animals along with their puppeteers dressed in black.",
      "Once on the water, the animals \u2014 a gorilla, a leopard, an elephant, a wildebeest, a giraff and a donkey \u2014 all come alive. The gorilla hoots, the donkey brays and wags its tail as the leopard bends its neck toward the surface as if to drink but halts just before its face meets the water and then turns to look around.",
      "It is Saturday, the second day of \u201c The Herds\u201d theatrical tour stop in Nigeria on a journey 20,000 kilometers (12,427 miles) from Africa's Congo Basin to the Arctic Circle with puppet animals. It's a journey organizers say is meant to bring attention to the climate crisis and \u201crenew our bond with the natural world.\u201d",
      "The tour started last week in Kinshasa, the capital of Congo, and will continue across the world with Dakar, the Senegalese capital, as the next stop.",
      "The story goes that the animals will be forced out of their natural habitats due to global warming and displaced north, stopping in cities along the way and being joined by more animals.",
      "The sprawling slum of Makoko \u2014 an old fishing village \u2014 was perfect to illustrate that because it has for many years shown resilience in the face of climate change, often finding ways to adapt to extreme weather, said Amir Nizar Zuabi, \u201cThe Herds\u201d artistic director.",
      "Dubbed the Venice of Africa, the Makoko slum is a low-lying community vulnerable to rising sea levels and flooding. Lagos itself is no stranger to the impacts of climate change, with roads and houses across the coastal city often engulfed during annual flooding.",
      "\u201cWe are on the edge of one of the greatest global crises, and ... I think the global south offers a lot of knowledge and a lot of resilience,\u201d Zuabi said, referring to developing countries in the Southern Hemisphere with lower incomes and higher poverty rates compared to the \u201cglobal north.\u201d",
      "Spread out beneath the Third Mainland Bridge that connects much of Lagos, Makoko came alive as \u201cThe Herds\u201d moved in. People poked their heads out of windows in awe of the exhibition. Children and women stood on the plank porches outside their rickety wood houses, watching as the animals paddled in through the narrow waterways. Some mimicked the animals while others applauded and waved at them.",
      "\u201cIt looked so real,\u201d Samuel Shemede, a 22-year-old resident of Makoko, said in awe of the puppets. \u201cI had never seen something like that before in my life. It is not real, but they made it look so real.\u201d",
      "As the tour left Makoko and moved to the Yaba suburb, the city's notorious traffic stood still for the puppets as they towered over people and vehicles. The big animals had been joined by smaller primates like monkeys who hoot noisily, prance around, and even dance.",
      "The tour was punctuated by dance and choreography performances from a local theater group whose performers, clothed in beige sack material and straw hats, intermittently charged toward the puppets as though they were about to attack them.",
      "As they journeyed through the streets, spectators were treated to chants from the Hausa language song \"Amfara,\" which loosely translates to \u201cWe have started.\u201d",
      "At a time when African nations are losing up to 5% of their gross domestic product every year as they bear a heavier burden than the rest of the world from climate change, \u201cThe Herds\u201d organizers said it is important to break down climate change and its impacts in a way that many people can relate to.",
      "\u201cA lot of climate debate is about science \u2026 and scientific words don\u2019t mean anything for most people,\u201d Zuabi, the artistic director, said. \u201cI wanted to create a piece of art that talks about nature, beauty and how animals are wild and majestic.\"",
      "The animals invading cities is a metaphor for abnormal things now becoming normal as the world deals with climate change, he said. \u201cAnd hopefully this becomes a way to talk about what we are going to lose if we continue burning fossil fuels.\u201d",

      "The International Pentecost Holiness Church was founded in South Africa in the early 1960s. It is an African-initiated church, meaning it was founded by Africans rather than foreign missionaries, and blends Pentecostal beliefs with local traditions.",
      "The church has held mass weddings before, including in 2023 when around 400 couples or bridal parties tied the knot. It says this year's event was its largest by far.",
      "Ndala said the large number of people being married this year was because of \u201ca large number of men marrying more than one wife at a go.\u201d",
      "In some cases, grooms brought their current wife or wives to be with them for their new marriage.",
      "The weddings were held at the church's headquarters, a huge, dome-shaped building in the town of Heidelberg, near Johannesburg, that can seat 60,000 people.",
      "The congregants who were being married waited in long white tents set up in open fields next to the church building, where they were given bridal flowers, food packs and water. They then filed into the church building in long queues, the women wearing white bridal gowns and many of the men in matching white suits and red ties.",
      "Polygamy is legal in South Africa if the union is registered as a customary marriage.",

      "\u201cThe first weeks of a calf\u2019s life are always the most delicate \u2014 even if the calf currently appears healthy and fit,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "The Asian elephant, or Elephas maximus, is a critically endangered species with about 50,000 estimated in the wild, and their numbers are declining, the zoo said. The zoo breeds the elephants as part of conservation efforts under the European Endangered Species Program, Dressen said.",

      "They have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well.",
      "Vance\u2019s first visit to New Delhi comes amid the backdrop of Trump's now-paused tariff program against most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi\u2019s main rival in the region.",
      "Modi and Vance are expected to \u201creview the progress in bilateral relations\u201d and \u201cexchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest,\u201d India\u2019s Foreign Ministry said last week.",
      "\u201cWe are very positive that the visit will give a further boost to our bilateral ties,\u201d spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.",
      "Vance was greeted with an Indian classical dance performance after he arrived at New Delhi\u2019s Palam airport on Monday, following his visit to Rome, where he met Pope Francis on Easter Sunday. He is accompanied by his wife, Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India, along with their children and officials from the U.S. administration.",
      "The couple and their three young children visited the Akshardham Hindu temple in New Delhi after their arrival and are expected to tour the iconic Taj Mahal monument and the 12th-century Amer Fort \u2014 a UNESCO world heritage site \u2014 during their trip.",
      "India is a close partner of the U.S. and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "It is also part of the Quad, which is comprised of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China\u2019s expansion in the region. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year.",
      "Modi established a good working relationship with Trump during his first term in office and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries.",
      "He was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \u201cmega partnership\u201d with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration\u2019s demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S.",
      "Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a \u201ctariff abuser\u201d and \u201ctariff king.\u201d",
      "The trade negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors.",

      "Stores selling secondhand clothing, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s trade war even as global businesses race to avoid potential damage",
      "NEW YORK -- Stores selling secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from President Donald Trump'strade war even as businesses the world over race to avert potential damage, according to industry experts.",
      "American styles carry international influence, but nearly all of the clothing sold domestically is made elsewhere. The Yale University Budget Lab last week estimated short-term consumer price increases of 65% for clothes and 87% for leather goods, noting U.S. tariffs \"disproportionately affect\u201d those goods.",
      "Such price hikes may drive cost-conscious shoppers to online resale sites, consignment boutiques and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash. Used items cost less than their new equivalents and only would be subject to tariffs if they come from outside the country.",
      "\u201cI think resale is going to grow in a market that is declining,\u201d said Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel industry analyst at market research firm Circana. \u201cWhat I think is going to continue to win in this chaotic environment are channels that bring value.\u201d",
      "The outlook for preowned fashion nevertheless comes with unknowns, including whether the president's tariffs will stay long enough to pinch consumers and change their behavior. It's also unclear whether secondhand purveyors will increase their own prices, either to mirror the overall market or in response to shopper demand.",
      "Jan Genovese, a retired fashion executive, sells her unwanted designer clothes through customer-to-customer marketplaces like Mercari. If tariffs cause retail prices to rise, she would consider high-end secondhand sites.",
      "\u201cUntil I see it and really have that sticker shock, I can\u2019t say exclusively that I\u2019ll be pushed into another direction,\u201d Genovese, 75, said. \u201cI think that the tariff part of it is that you definitely rethink things. And maybe I will start looking at alternative venues.\u201d",
      "The secondhand clothing market already was flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the U.S. fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predicted after the COVID-19 pandemic that global revenue from preowned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year as shoppers looked to save money or spend it in a more environmentally conscious way.",
      "While millennials and members of Generation Z were known as the primary buyers of used clothing, data from market research firm Sensor Tower shows the audience may be expanding.",
      "The number of mobile app downloads for nine resale marketplaces the firm tracks \u2014 eBay, OfferUp, Poshmark, Mercari, Craigslist, Depop, ThredUp, TheRealReal and Vinted \u2014 increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years, Sensor Tower said.",
      "The firm estimates downloads of the apps for eBay, Depop, ThredUp and The RealReal also surged compared to a year earlier for the week of March 31, which was when Trump unveiled since-paused punitive tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "Circana\u2019s Classi-Zummo said that while customers used to seek out collectible or unusual vintage pieces to supplement their wardrobes, she has noticed more shoppers turning to secondhand sites to replace regular fashion items.",
      "\"It's still a cheaper option\u201d than buying new, even though retailers offer discounts, she said.",
      "Poshmark, a digital platform where users buy and sell preowned clothing, has yet to see sales pick up under the tariff schedule Trump unveiled but is prepared to capitalize on the moment, CEO Manish Chandra said.",
      "Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces upgrade their technology to make it easier to find items. A visual search tool and other improvements to the Poshmark experience will \u201cpay long dividends in terms of disruption that happens in the market\u201d from the tariffs, Chandra said.",
      "Archive, a San Francisco-based technology company that builds and manages online and in-store resale programs for brands including Dr. Martens, The North Face and Lululemon, has noticed clothing labels expressing more urgency to team up, CEO Emily Gittins said.",
      "\"Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the U.S., either in people\u2019s closets or in warehouses not being used,\u201d offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty,\u201d Gittins said. \u201cEveryone believes that this is going to be hugely damaging to consumer goods brands that sell in the U.S. So resale is basically where everyone\u2019s head is going.\"",
      "Stock analysts have predicted off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores will weather tariffs more easily than regular apparel chains and department stores because they carry leftover merchandise in the U.S.",
      "Still, resale vendors aren't immune from tariff-induced upheavals, said Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of Circular Services Group, a firm that advises brands and retailers on reducing the fashion industry's environmental impact.",
      "U.S. sellers that import secondhand inventory from European Union countries would have to pay a 20% duty if Trump moves forward with instituting \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most trading partners and eliminates an import tax exception for parcels worth less than $800, Kibbe said.",
      "A circular fashion coalition she leads is seeking a tariff exemption for used and recycled goods that will be offered for resale, Kibbe said. Trump already ended the duty-free provision for low-value parcels from China, a move that may benefit sellers of secondhand clothing by making low-priced Chinese fashions pricier, she said.",
      "James Reinhart, co-founder and CEO of the online consignment marketplace ThredUp, said the removal of the \u201cde minimis\u201d provision and the 145% tariff Trump put on products made in China would benefit businesses like his. He doubts creating resale channels would make a big difference for individual brands.",
      "\u201cBrands will explore this and they may do more, but I don\u2019t see them massively changing their operations,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be figuring out how to survive. And I don\u2019t think resale helps you survive.\u201d",
      "Rebag, an online marketplace and retail chain that sells used designer handbags priced from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars, expects tariffs to help drive new customers and plans to open more physical stores, CEO Charles Gorra said.",
      "Gorra said the company would analyze prices for new luxury goods and adjust what Rebag charges accordingly. The two historically rose in tandem, but Rebag could not match Chanel's 10% price increase last year because of lower resale demand, Gorra said.",
      "\u201cThat has nothing to do with the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are feeling priced out.\u201d",
      "Norah Brotman, 22, a senior at the University of Minnesota, buys most of her own clothes on eBay. She also thrifts fashions from the 1990s and early 2000s at Goodwill stores and resells them on Depop.",
      "If tariffs upend the economics of fast fashion and discourage mindless consumption, Brotman would count that as a plus.",
      "\u201cI would love if this would steer people in a different direction,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Removing lanes to slow down speeding drivers is a long-embraced strategy for improving safety on city streets",
      "A stylist was just starting her shift at a salon in Kansas City, Missouri, when a car smashed through the storefront window and landed in the waiting area a few feet away.",
      "Such crashes were so common along 31st Street that business owners regularly texted one another photos showing the damage caused by vehicles speeding along the four-lane road lined with shops, bars and restaurants, which drivers used as a shortcut between major highways.",
      "\u201cA wide road makes people think, \u2018We\u2019ll just drive as fast as we want on it,'\" said Ryan Ferrell, who owns the property housing the salon, a bookstore and apartments above.",
      "When concrete sidewalk barriers didn\u2019t work, Ferrell and other business leaders campaigned to put the street on a \u201croad diet.\"",
      "Removing lanes has been a tool numerous cities have used for years to calm traffic, despite resistance from some Republican governors. President Donald Trump's administration doesn't like it either.",
      "Federal transportation officials once heralded road diets for cutting crashes by 19% to 47%, but criteria for an upcoming round of road safety grants say projects aimed at \u201creducing lane capacity\u201d should be considered \u201cless favorably,\" the administration said.",
      "Forcing travelers into more constrained spaces \u201ccan lead to crashes, erratic maneuvers, and a false sense of security that puts everyone at risk,\u201d the U.S. Department of Transportation said in an email statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThe update reflects the Department\u2019s concerns about the safety hazards associated with congestion.\u201d",
      "Kansas City saved some money when it converted 31st Street in 2022 because a gas line was going in anyway. It reopened with one lane in each direction instead of two, a shared turn lane near the signalized intersections, better pedestrian crossings and protected on-street parking spaces.",
      "Road diets are now an almost automatic part of the process in Kansas City whenever a street is up for repaving. For years, federal guidelines said lane reductions were usually appropriate on roads carrying fewer than 25,000 vehicles a day. Most of the city's four-lane roads don't meet that threshold.",
      "Bobby Evans, an urban planner at the Mid-America Regional Council who has worked on Kansas City's road diets, calls the strategy \"a smashing success\" and one of the most effective tools at reducing speed, crashes and injuries.",
      "\u201cIn the architectural world you\u2019d call it environmental determinism,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou want to make it so they don\u2019t feel comfortable going too fast. You\u2019re really not slowing them down. You\u2019re bringing them back to the speed limit.\u201d",
      "Numerous other cities have credited road diets with improving safety.",
      "Philadelphia cited a 19% drop in injury crashes. Portland, Oregon, saw a more than 70% decline in vehicles traveling at least 10 mph (16 kph) over the speed limit. The average speed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fell by 5 mph (8 kph) on some roads within months.",
      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said most road diets represent an ill-advised effort to force vehicles off the road. The number of vehicles may decline on dieted roads, but then surrounding roads have to absorb the traffic, he said.",
      "\u201cThose cars have to go somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cCars are like water. They seek their own level.\u201d",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said road diets are inexpensive and supported by years of research. Cities in Republican-led states are among the converts and Shahum isn't sure if the Trump administration's new guidance will make them reconsider.",
      "\u201cI certainly hope that does not bleed over into indirectly discouraging communities from using this proven safety countermeasure,\u201d Shahum said. \u201cThat would be a real loss.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s transportation department cited delivery and emergency vehicles among its concerns.",
      "When University of Iowa researchers surveyed first-responders in Cedar Rapids, their study published last year found no noticeable difference in response time when a road diet was in place. There was, however, a perceived need to educate drivers about what to do when an ambulance uses a center turn lane to pass.",
      "Cara Hamann, an associate professor of epidemiology who co-authored the study, said she recalled no major examples of EMS or fire trucks being unable to get through.",
      "\u201cThe road diet didn\u2019t cause a level of congestion that slowed them down,\u201d she said.",
      "Even before Trump, skepticism was growing in some red states.",
      "San Antonio spent years planning to repurpose a formerly state-owned portion of its Broadway Street by removing vehicle lanes and improving a stretch for bikes and pedestrians. But Texas abruptly reclaimed the road in 2022 and nixed the project as GOP Gov. Greg Abbott ran for reelection and called for an end to anti-car policies.",
      "\u201cThey basically used Broadway as a political football,\u201d said Bryan Martin, owner of Bronko Bikes, an electric bike repair shop.",
      "Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last year a 180-day review period and other numerous steps before a local government can eliminate a lane. He said it would prevent activists from intentionally clogging roads to slow vehicles.",
      "Not all the pushback has come from Republican-led states. During the pandemic, Culver City, California, implemented a road diet to prioritize walking, biking and transit. But when cars returned and traffic backed up for miles, the city reversed the plan.",
      "Some residents sued in Vancouver, Washington, saying the city should have put its road diets up for a public vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen people passing in the shoulder or the bike lane,\u201d said Justin Wood, one of the opponents. \u201cIt creates more opportunity for conflict.\u201d",
      "Evans, the planner in Kansas City, said road diets can't stop all reckless drivers.",
      "\u201cIf you are bound and determined to go 12 miles over the speed limit on a three-lane road, you\u2019re going to have to engage in some stupid, dangerous driving,\u201d Evans said.",

      "An Associated Press analysis of an aviation safety database reveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial aircraft taking off and landing at major U.S. airports",
      "WASHINGTON -- A commercial airliner was on final approach to San Francisco\u2019s international airport in November when the crew spotted a drone outside the cockpit window. By then it was too late \u201cto take evasive action,\u201d the pilots reported, and the quadcopter passed by their windshield, not 300 feet away.",
      "A month earlier, a jetliner was flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet near Miami\u2019s international airport when its pilots reported a \u201cclose encounter\u201d with a drone. In August, a drone came within 50 feet of clipping the left wing of a passenger jet as it departed Newark International Airport.",
      "The incidents were all classified as \u201cnear midair collisions\u201d \u2014 any one of which could have had catastrophic consequences, according to aviation safety experts. They were also not isolated encounters.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of an aviation safety database reveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial passenger planes taking off and landing at the country's top 30 busiest airports. That was the highest percentage of such near misses since 2020, when air traffic dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The first reports of near misses involving drones were logged in 2014, the AP found. The number of such encounters spiked the following year. Over the last decade, drones accounted for 51% \u2014 122 of 240 \u2014 of reported near misses, according to AP's analysis.",
      "Passenger jets have long been subject to risks around airports \u2014 whether from bird strikes or congested airspace \u2014 as was made clear by the January collision between a military helicopter and commercial jet near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.",
      "The threat from drones has become more acute in the last decade as the use of quadcopters and remote-controlled planes has exploded in popularity. The FAA estimates that Americans are operating more than a million drones for recreational and commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cIf you have the money, you can go on the internet and buy a pretty sophisticated drone that can reach altitudes they really have no business being at,\u201d said William Waldock, a professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.",
      "The risk is most acute near airports because that is where the flight paths of drones and airplanes most overlap, experts said.",
      "The incidents represent only a portion of such close calls because the database \u2014 NASA\u2019s Aviation Safety Reporting System \u2014 relies on voluntary submissions from pilots and other aviation workers. A separate FAA program, which includes reports from the public, tallied at least 160 sightings last month of drones flying near airports.",
      "\u201cThe FAA recognizes that urgency, and we all know additional changes need to be made to allow the airports to go out and detect and mitigate where necessary,\u201d said Hannah Thach, executive director of the partnership, known as Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence.",
      "The FAA said it has taken steps to mitigate the risks of drones. It has prohibited nearly all drones from flying near airports without prior authorization, though such rules are difficult to enforce, and recreational users may not be aware of restrictions.",
      "The agency requires registrations for drones weighing more than 250 grams (0.55 pounds), and such drones are required to carry a radio transponder that identifies the drone\u2019s owner and broadcasts its position to help avert collisions. Additional rules govern commercial drone use.",
      "The agency has also been testing systems to detect and counter drones near airports. Among the methods being examined: Using radio signals to jam drones or force them to land. Authorities are also weighing whether to deploy high-powered microwaves or laser beams to disable the machines.",
      "Experts said the FAA and other authorities could do more. They suggested creating a system similar to speed cameras on roadways that could capture a drone\u2019s transponder code and send its pilots a ticket in the mail.",
      "They also said the FAA should consider regulations that require all manufacturers to program a drone\u2019s GPS unit to prevent it from flying near airports and other sensitive areas, a method called \u201cgeofencing.\u201d",
      "DJI, a leading drone maker, used such geofencing restrictions for years. However, it eliminated the feature in January, replacing it with an alert to drone pilots when they approach restricted areas.",
      "Adam Welsh, head of global policy at DJI, said managing requests from authorized users to temporarily disable the geofencing became an increasingly time-consuming task. More than one million such requests were processed last year.",
      "\u201cWe had around-the-clock service, but the number of applications coming in were becoming really hard to handle,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cThey all had to be reviewed individually.\u201d",
      "With no other manufacturers enabling geofencing, and without government rules requiring it, DJI decided to end the practice, he said.",
      "The FAA declined to say if it is considering whether to mandate geofencing.",
      "Experts said authorities should take more aggressive action to hold drone users accountable for violating restricted airspace \u2014 to highlight the problem and deter others from breaking the rules, pointing to recent arrests that they hoped might send such a message.",
      "In December, for example, Boston police arrested two men who operated a drone that flew dangerously close to Logan International Airport. Police reported that they were able to find the drone flyers, in part, by tracking the aircraft thanks to its FAA-mandated transponder signal.",
      "A month later, a small drone collided with a \u201cSuper Scooper\u201d plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane's left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs.",
      "Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man, who has yet to be sentenced, admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that's when it struck the \u201cSuper Scooper.\"",

      "The Kansas City, Missouri, metropolitan area has long been a regional hub for the federal government, and the pain from the Trump administration's cuts can be seen everywhere",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided day care for the children of U.S. soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs.",
      "Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion.",
      "But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in the latest mass firing ordered by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter out of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at the Administration for Children and Families, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cNot only me, but all these peoples\u2019 lives are turned upside down,\u201d Giagnorio said.",
      "The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency can be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy.",
      "With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.",
      "An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout.",
      "A U.S. Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically Black neighborhood\u2019s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded.",
      "The withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic.",
      "A landlord may have to sell an office building for a loss after his federal tenants were among several that abruptly canceled local leases, adding a glut of real estate to the market.",
      "And the city's Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk\u2019s electric car company out of Missouri.",
      "The nation's health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency's 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families.",
      "\u201cThe poor will become even more poor now,\u201d Giagnorio said. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we\u2019re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?\u201d",
      "Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers.",
      "But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn\u2019t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year.",
      "For now, she can\u2019t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when?",
      "The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful.",
      "The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what\u2019s required of them,\u201d said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.",
      "By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week.",
      "Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies.",
      "Ellis said IRS workers share the public\u2019s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she\u2019s decided to take a \u201croll of the dice\u201d and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer.",
      "\u201cI love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the bully force me out.\u201d",
      "Urban farmer Rosie Warren grew 2,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighborhood, where many Black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century.",
      "Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers\u2019 market serving the area.",
      "Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children.",
      "In February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award \u201cno longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "On a recent morning, Warren took a break from preparing the soil for planting to ponder the USDA\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cWhat do you do if you don\u2019t support providing access to food to people who don\u2019t have it? Wouldn\u2019t this make your job easier?\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",
      "Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising.",
      "At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City.",
      "\u201cIt just means giving families less food,\u201d said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he\u2019s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Health Department\u2019s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.",
      "One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times.",
      "Kansas City\u2019s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.",
      "\u201cThat early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,\u201d she said.",
      "But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration's $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news \u201ccrushed\u201d the department's carefully laid plans, Jones said.",
      "Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents.",
      "\u201cIt would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.\u201d",
      "Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he\u2019s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.",
      "Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month.",
      "Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz of hundreds of lease cancellations that has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.",
      "In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE\u2019s online \u201cWall of Receipts.\u201d",
      "Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market.",
      "But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cBusinesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are going to be unhappy but it\u2019s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.\u201d",
      "With liberal anger growing at Musk\u2019s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts.",
      "State records show Tesla sales there have dropped amid calls for a boycott. Now, enough voter anger could even force the business to close.",
      "Organizers of a newly launched \u201cUnplug Musk\u201d initiative are seeking to use democracy to strike at the world\u2019s richest man by changing state law to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.",
      "They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a soul in this country who\u2019s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people\u2019s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that. And it is going to cause some devastating impacts,\u201d said organizer Brad Ketcher, a prominent Democrat and lawyer who helped draft the state\u2019s 2022 marijuana legalization referendum.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, \u201cHHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "The IRS has offered a similar rationale for its downsizing, saying it is making process improvements that will ultimately more efficiently serve the public.",
      "Musk said last year that Trump\u2019s budget cuts would cause a \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d that would soon put the economy on stronger footing.",
      "One local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship will be in Kansas City, including whether it will just slow growth or cause population losses.",
      "\u201cIt's a big burden that\u2019s being placed on a narrow group of people,\u201d said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a nonprofit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. \u201cIt will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.\"",
      "Trump has credited DOGE with helping end \u201cthe flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d saving billions to help improve the nation\u2019s finances.",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about Kansas City. But Trump said recently he would invite the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House to make up for a 2020 Super Bowl victory celebration that was canceled during the pandemic.",

      "Raising a child in America has never been cheap",
      "Sam Rutledge and his wife have a baby due in mid-July, so they thought they had a few more months to research and buy the gear they\u2019ll need.",
      "But President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in early April turned the couple\u2019s slow walk into a sprint. In the past few weeks, they\u2019ve bought two strollers, a car seat, a nursery glider, a crib and a high chair. All of them are made overseas.",
      "\u201cThese are all pretty expensive under normal conditions, but when it became clear tariffs were coming we decided to buy them in case they became prohibitively expensive,\u201d said Rutledge, who is a high school physics teacher.",
      "Raising a child in America has never been cheap. In the first year alone, it costs an average of $20,384, according to Baby Center, a parenting website. But tariffs \u2013 ranging from 10% for imports from most countries to 145% for imports from China -- will make it many times more expensive for new parents.",
      "An estimated 90% of the core baby care products and the parts that go into making baby paraphernalia \u2013 from bottles and diaper pails to strollers and car seats \u2013 are made in Asia, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, a U.S. trade group. The vast majority come from China.",
      "\u201cOverseas manufacturing has been the norm in our industry for decades,\u201d said Lisa Trofe, the association's executive director.",
      "It wasn\u2019t always this way. When Munchkin Inc. CEO Steven Dunn founded his company in 1991, it made baby bottles in California with tooling from New Jersey. But over the years, the manufacturers he used shut down and the cost of doing business in the U.S. skyrocketed. Now, about 60% of Munchkin\u2019s 500 products, from a $5 sippy cup to a $254 Night Owl Stroller with headlights, are made in China.",
      "In response to the tariffs, Dunn halted orders from China and instituted a hiring freeze at Munchkin\u2019s California headquarters, where 320 people are employed. Dunn expects Munchkin will run out of some products within three months.",
      "\u201cThere is no possibility of being able to pass on those tariffs\u201d to customers in the form of price increases, he said.",
      "Dunn said he tried to reduce his dependence on China in recent years, shifting some manufacturing to Vietnam and Mexico. He also spent a year communicating with American manufacturers to see if one could make Munchkin\u2019s new Flow Nipple Shield, which allows a breastfeeding mother to see if her milk is flowing. But most said they couldn\u2019t make the complex silicone product, Dunn said. It\u2019s now made in Vietnam.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough tool makers and manufacturing expertise and automation and skilled labor in the U.S. to make the thousands of products the juvenile industry needs,\u201d Dunn said.",
      "Multiple baby brands and companies contacted by The Associated Press didn\u2019t respond or said they weren\u2019t commenting on the tariffs, including Graco, Chicco, Britax, Nuna, Dorel Juvenile, UppaBaby, Evenflo and Bugaboo.",
      "The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association said it asked the Trump administration for a tariff exemption, arguing that baby products are essential for children's well-being. Trump exempted some baby products, including car seats and high chairs, from import taxes during his first administration. But he hasn't said whether he would consider doing so again.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with the White House.",
      "Nurture&, a company that makes a popular nursery glider and other baby furniture, said it\u2019s trying to be transparent about the impact of tariffs.",
      "In a recent email, the company told customers it started lowering prices on some items when the tariffs hit. The company, which was founded in 2020, said it would keep those lower prices in place until April 30, but after that it may not be able to absorb the full cost of the import duties.",
      "\u201cThese are large purchases, these are investments, and this is a very sensitive life stage,\u201d Nurture& Chief Merchant Jill Gruys said. \u201cWe want people to make the best decision for their budget and their family.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Mahon, the owner of Three Littles, a baby store in Washington, said she\u2019s worried the tariffs will make essential products too expensive for some families.",
      "Mahon volunteers twice per month at the Department of Motor Vehicles, where she teaches people how to buckle their kids safely into car seats. Some families still must be persuaded to use car seats, she said. Mahon fears higher prices would be another deterrent.",
      "\u201cNo one is dying if they can\u2019t buy a toy, but if they don\u2019t have access to car seats, kids will get seriously injured,\u201d she said.",
      "At her own store, Mahon is getting notices that some manufacturers plan to introduce steep price increases in May. She feels lucky she could rent a storage facility and build up inventory ahead of the tariffs. For many small businesses, she said, the extra costs are \u201ca death sentence.\u201d",
      "At The Little Seedling baby shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, owner Molly Ging said she would normally be putting in Christmas orders at this time of year. Instead, she\u2019s sorting through price increase notices from many of the vendors she works with.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to manage, and I just have no idea how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d she said.",
      "Business is brisk right now, with customers hoping to beat tariff-related price increases. But Ging worries about her 13 employees \u2013 all moms who bring their kids to work \u2013 and about whether she can maintain enough inventory to meet future demand.",
      "\u201cBabies don\u2019t stop being born because there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster off the Gulf Coast, the effects of the largest oil spill in U.S. history are still being felt",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the Gulf Coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons (500 million liters) of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nation's worst offshore oil spill are still being felt.",
      "Oil company BP paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significant compensation.",
      "Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in Louisiana. As the Trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the Gulf Coast are slipping away.",
      "In the coastal community of Lafitte in southeast Louisiana, Tammy Gremillion is celebrating Easter Sunday, the anniversary of the April 20 spill, without her daughter. She remembers warning Jennifer against joining a cleanup crew tasked with containing the spill for BP.",
      "\"But I couldn\u2019t stop her \u2014 they were offering these kids lots of money,\u201d Gremillion said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the dangers. They didn\u2019t do what they should have to protect these young people.\u201d",
      "Jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. She also was exposed to Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has been linked to health problems.",
      "In 2020, Jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can be caused by exposure to oil.",
      "Gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughter's death, is \u201c1,000% confident\u201d that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against BP in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. Gremillion's suit is one of a small number of cases still pending.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed and only one has been settled.",
      "In a 2012 settlement, BP paid ill workers and coastal residents $67 million, but this amounted to no more than $1,300 each for nearly 80% of those seeking compensation.",
      "Attorneys from the Downs Law Group, representing Gremillion and around 100 others in cases against BP, say the company leveraged procedural technicalities to block victims from getting their day in court.",
      "BP declined to comment on pending litigation. In court filings, BP denied allegations that oil exposure caused health problems and attacked the credibility of medical experts brought by plaintiffs.",
      "The environmental impact was devastating, recalled PJ Hahn, who served on the frontlines as a southeast Louisiana coastal management official. He watched the oil eat away at barrier islands and marsh around his community in Plaquemines Parish until \u201cit would just crumble like a cookie in hot coffee, just break apart.\u201d",
      "Oyster beds suffocated, reefs were blanketed in chemicals and the fishing industry tanked. Pelicans diving for dead fish emerged from the contaminated waters smeared in a black sheen. Tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Since then, \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made restoring Gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to The\u200b Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against BP.",
      "The council says more than 300 restoration projects worth $5.38 billion have been approved in the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America. The projects include acquiring wetlands in Mississippi to protect nesting areas for birds, rebuilding reefs along Pensacola Bay in Florida and restoring around 4 square miles (11 square kilometers) of marsh in Lake Borgne near New Orleans.",
      "While a tragedy, the spill \"galvanized a movement \u2014 one that continues to push for a healthier, more resilient coast,\u201d said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a conservation coalition.",
      "The influx of billions of dollars in penalties paid by BP \"allowed us to think bigger, act faster and rely on science to guide large-scale solutions,\u201d she added.",
      "Yet what many conservationists see as the flagship of the restoration projects funded by the Deepwater Horizon disaster payout \u2014 an approximately $3 billion effort to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to rebuild 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) of land in southeast Louisiana \u2014 has stalled over concerns of its impact on the livelihoods of local communities and dolphin populations.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has said the project would \u201cbreak our culture\" by harming local oyster and shrimp fisheries due to the influx of freshwater. Earlier this month, his administration paused the project for 90 days, citing its high costs, and its future remains uncertain.",
      "The Trump administration is seeking to sell more offshore oil and gas leases, which the industry trade group American Petroleum Institute called \u201ca big step forward for American energy dominance.\u201d",
      "BP announced an oil discovery in the Gulf last week and plans more than 40 new wells in the next three years. The company told the AP it has improved safety standards and oversight.",
      "\u201cWe remain keenly aware that we must always put safety first,\u201d BP said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have made many changes so that such an event should never happen again.\"",
      "Still, Joseph Gordon, climate and energy director for the nonprofit Oceana, warned Deepwater Horizon's legacy should be \u201can alarm bell\u201d against the expansion of offshore drilling.",

      "The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an \u201ceconomic and national security\u201d priority and says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, leading to \u201cbetter-paying ...",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Drew Greenblatt is fully on board with the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs to rebalance a global trading system that it says favors foreign companies over U.S. manufacturers.",
      "Greenblatt is the president and owner of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore, Maryland, which makes baskets and racks for medical device manufacturers, aerospace companies, food processing companies and others. It has 115 employees and makes its products in three locations in Maryland, Indiana and Michigan. The steel is sourced from Tennessee, Illinois and Michigan.",
      "Currently, it\u2019s hard to compete with baskets made overseas., Greenblatt says, because the countries he competes against have an \u201cunfair advantage.\u201d For example, due to European tariffs and taxes, it costs much more for a German consumer or company to buy Marlin wire baskets than it does for Americans to buy a German-made basket, creating an uneven playing field, Greenblatt said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wildly unfair to the American worker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this has, by the way, been going on for decades.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an \u201ceconomic and national security\u201d priority. U.S. manufacturing has been declining for decades. In June 1979, the number of manufacturing workers peaked at 19.6 million. By January of 2025, employment was down 35% to 12.8 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Small manufacturers, which make up 99% of all American manufacturing, have been hit particularly hard.",
      "The administration has implemented some tariffs against major U.S. trading partners, while putting a hold on other tariffs pending negotiations. The Trump administration says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, which will mean \u201cbetter-paying American jobs,\u201d for people making cars, appliances and other goods.",
      "Greenblatt agrees, saying he could double his staff if \u201cparity\u201d in tariffs becomes a reality.",
      "While other small manufacturing businesses also support the tariffs, other owners have concerns. The Trump tariffs threaten to upend the existing economic order and possibly push the global economy into recession. And the uneven rollout of the policy has created uncertainty for businesses, financial markets and U.S. households.",
      "For Corry Blanc, the injection of uncertainty around the economy outstrips any potential benefit.",
      "He started his business, Blanc Creatives in Waynesboro, Virginia, in 2012. He makes handcrafted cookware such as skillets and other kitchenware and bakeware with American steel and wood and employs 12 staffers. He gets his steel from a plant in South Carolina and a distributor in Richmond. Wood comes from local regional sawmills near the company\u2019s headquarters in Waynesboro, Virginia.",
      "He said he\u2019s been fielding worried calls from customers in Canada and overseas. And he says the infrastructure isn\u2019t in place to increase production if more people do start buying American-made goods.",
      "Blanc said he survived the pandemic and other tough times, but conditions now are the hardest they\u2019ve ever been.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty and not a lot of direction,\u201d he said.",
      "Michael Lyons is the founder of Rogue Industries, a company that makes wallets and other leather goods in a workshop in Standish, Maine, with a staff of nine. He uses leather from Maine and the Midwest. About 80% of his products are made in Maine and 20% are imported.",
      "He said the uncertainty around the tariffs is outweighing any potential long-term benefit. A long-time customer from Canada recently told Lyons that he would no longer be buying from Rogue Industries because of the friction between the two countries.",
      "\u201cHopefully this will pass, and he\u2019ll be able to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did think that was kind of an interesting indicator for him to reach out.\u201d",
      "Lyons would like to expand his business, but says, \u201cat the time being, it\u2019s probably going to be, we hold with what we have.\u201d",
      "American Giant CEO Bayard Winthrop takes a more positive view. He founded his clothing company in 2011 after watching the textile industry go offshore, and seeing a lack of quality, affordable American-made clothing. He started by selling one sweatshirt, and now sells a wider range of clothing, mostly direct-to-consumer, but he also has a contract with Walmart.",
      "He sources cotton from Southeastern states like Georgia, Florida and North Carolina and has a factory in North Carolina and a joint partnership facility in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cPeople forget that in about 1985 that all the clothing that Americans bought was made in America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only in the last 40 years that that we really pursued as a country a very aggressive approach to globalization.\u201d",
      "In 1991, more than half of U.S. apparel, about 56%, was made in the U.S., according to statistics from the American Apparel and Footwear Association. By 2023 that number had shrunk to less than 4%.",
      "Winthrop hopes the tariffs will bring about a return to more American-made products.",
      "\u201cThe imbalances between our trading, in particularly with China, particularly the textiles, it\u2019s just shocking, to be honest with you,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes Trump's policies \"put domestic manufacturers on a bit more of a competitive footing.\u201d",
      "Winthrop understands people\u2019s concerns but said it\u2019s important to think longer term.",
      "\u201cAmericans are worried about tariffs, and I think there\u2019s a lot of justification for the worry because I think the administration can be volatile and unpredictable,\u201d he said. But he added that people should put that aside.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to be more protective of our domestic marketplace and have an industrial policy that includes manufacturing jobs is, an old idea. It\u2019s not a new idea,\u201d he said.",

      "The federal agency tasked with protecting workers\u2019 civil rights is classifying all new gender identity-related discrimination cases as its lowest priority, essentially putting them on indefinite hold, according to two agency employees.",
      "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission held a meeting on Wednesday clarifying how it would treat new worker complaints of gender-identity discrimination in view of President Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Staff who handle incoming charges, or intakes, were directed to code them as \u201cC,\u201d the lowest categorization in the EEOC's system that is usually reserved for meritless charges, according to the agency employees who attended the Microsoft Teams meeting for intake supervisors, district directors and support staff that was led by the EEOC's national intake coordinator. The employees asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to reveal the meeting details.",
      "An EEOC spokesman declined to comment on the meeting, saying that \u201cper federal law, we cannot discuss investigatory practices.\u201d",
      "The decision is the latest step by the EEOC to back away from defending the rights of transgender and nonbinary workers in a major shift in civil rights enforcement under the Trump administration. In February, the EEOC moved to drop seven of its own pending lawsuits alleging discrimination against transgender and nonbinary people.",
      "EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, has said one of her priorities will be implementing Trump\u2019s executive order on gender and \u201cdefending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\u201d She had previously ordered that any worker discrimination charge that \u201cimplicates\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order on gender should be elevated to headquarters for review.",
      "This latest decision to bury gender identity-related complaints leaves transgender and nonbinary people experiencing discrimination at work with limited recourse. U.S. workers must file discrimination complaints through the EEOC in most cases before they can seek other legal avenues.",
      "Giving gender identity-related cases the lowest priority essentially pre-determines that they are meritless, said Chai Feldblum, who was an EEOC commissioner from 2010-2019.",
      "\u201cIf they say they are bringing it to a central location to give them due consideration, they at least have the facade of doing something,\u201d Feldblum said of Lucas\u2019 previous directive on gender identity cases. \u201cIf they are sweeping them out the door as \u201cC\u201d charges, they are not doing their job.\u201d",
      "The EEOC has said that it will still issue \u201cright to sue\u201d notices in gender-identity related cases upon request, meaning workers can decide to pursue a lawsuit on their own. The agency will also honor requests for mediation, according to the employees who attended Wednesday's meeting. But if mediation fails, the EEOC will take no further action on the case, the employees said.",
      "The EEOC\u2019s new approach to gender-identity related discrimination has raised a debate over whether the agency is acting in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, a landmark case that established that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Civil rights activists have accused the EEOC of illegally defying the Supreme Court and abdicating its duty to enforce anti-discrimination laws by abandoning gender-identity related lawsuits. Lucas has previously told The AP that the EEOC has a duty to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders but she has not directly addressed the criticism that the agency\u2019s handling of gender-identity cases are in tension with the Supreme Court.",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand, the Cambodian government agency heading the project announced Friday.",
      "The deal to fund the Funan Techo Canal was signed Thursday during the state visit to Cambodia of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the agency said in a news release. Xi returned home Friday after a three-nation Southeast Asian tour that also included Vietnam and Malaysia.",
      "Construction of the 151.6-kilometer (94-mile) canal began last year but was halted shortly after the Aug. 5 groundbreaking ceremony for reasons that were not made clear. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said at the time that the canal will be built \u201cno matter what the cost,\u201d emphasizing that the project promotes \u201cnational prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Described as a public-private partnership contract, the deal was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol on behalf of Cambodia\u2019s government, and by Ieng Sunly of the Funan Techo Coastal-Inland Waterways Company Ltd., the private sector partner. The project is being developed on a build-operate-transfer basis, with Cambodian investors holding a 51% stake, and Chinese investors holding 49%.",
      "\u201cThe canal will create a new inland waterway-maritime corridor capable of handling vessels up to 3,000 deadweight tons,\u201d according to Friday\u2019s announcement. It will encompass canal excavation and the construction of ship locks, navigation and logistics infrastructure.",
      "\u201cAs an inland waterway and important transport infrastructure in Cambodia, the FTC Project will become a new engine driving national economic growth,\" said Wang Tongzhou, chairman of China Communications Construction Company, in the announcement. He added that \"after completion, it will significantly reduce the comprehensive logistics costs in Cambodia, and promote Cambodia\u2019s industry to the middle-to-high end of the value chain.\u201d",
      "China Communications Construction Company is the parent company of China Road and Bridge Corporation, the contractor for the project's construction from the Bassac River to the coastal province of Kep.

It is also blacklisted by the United States for its role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize artificial islands in the South China Sea.",
      "According to Friday's announcement, the canal is expected to create \"up to 50,000 direct and indirect jobs in Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Critics have raised concerns that the canal could severely disrupt the Mekong Rive r\u2019s natural flood patterns. These disruptions could lead to worsening droughts and a reduction in the nutrient-rich silt essential for Vietnam\u2019s vital rice production in the Mekong Delta, a region that sustains millions and is a major global rice exporter.",
      "The signing announcement, however, stated that \u201cA rigorous Environmental Impact Assessment, conducted by 48 specialists, confirmed minimal environmental impact.\u201d",
      "It added that the Cambodian government has led efforts to minimize resettlement \u201cwith a route designed to avoid dense communities and cultural sites\" and that \"a responsible compensation and consultation process is underway.\u201d",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure aimed at combating the kind of overtourism that put the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage tourists from visiting Venice even on high-traffic days.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Venice\u2019s battle with overtourism by the numbers:",
      "The fee charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros ($5.69) \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and the Tronchetto parking garage.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "That is the amount Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials said that 12,744 day-trippers paid to enter the city on Friday \u2014 7,173 at the higher 10-euro rate. They were among the 77,000 who have registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",
      "The number of annual arrivals of both day-trippers and overnight guests roughly confirmed by cellphone data tracked from a Smart Control Room since 2020, according to city officials.",

      "His arrival comes a day after the two countries held their first round of tariff talks between their top negotiators in Washington where both sides agreed to try to reach an agreement as quickly as possible and hold a second round of meetings later this month.",
      "Trump, alongside his top economic advisers Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, attended the meeting with the Japanese delegation headed by Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa at the White House.",
      "With his reputation as a dealmaker being tested, Trump likely wants to finalize a series of trade deals as countries around the world seek to curb damages from the U.S. tariffs.",
      "Trump's recent announcement of a 90-day pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports remains in place.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said the tariffs would deal a blow to Japan's economy and chill Japanese companies' investment in the U.S. and that the two sides should seek a settlement that would benefit both.",
      "Japan, a longstanding U.S. ally, is among the first countries that began negotiating with Washington. Other American allies are closely watching their talks.",
      "Glass said he is confident that a deal can be reached because \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d officials from both Japan and the U.S. are negotiating and Trump is personally involved in the talks, calling them his top priority.",
      "Trump is committed to \u201ctaking the new path with American economics,\u201d Glass said, adding that tariff measures are part of his strategy. America\u2019s $40 trillion national debt, Glass said, makes the country \"unsustainable and that\u2019s the end of our economy if we keep going down this road.\"",
      "Glass did not elaborate on how he could help Tokyo and Washington hammer out their differences when he assumes his official duties on Monday. After a long flight, he said, \u201cwhat I'd like to do first is to go home and take a nap.\"",

    "story": [
      "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels say U.S. airstrikes targeting oil port killed at least 74 people and injured at least 171 others",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels killed 74 people and wounded 171 others, the group said Friday, in the deadliest known attack under President Donald Trump\u2019s new military campaign against the Iranian-backed faction.",
      "The strike on the Ras Isa port, which sent massive fireballs shooting into the night sky, represented a major escalation in the American effort by hitting oil facilities for the first time.",
      "Assessing the toll of Trump\u2019s campaign, which began March 15, has been difficult, as the U.S. military's Central Command hasn't released any information, including its attacks' targets and how many people have been killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",
      "In a statement, Central Command said \u201cU.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\u201d it added. It did not acknowledge any casualties from the attack or offer any damage assessment.",
      "Hours after the strike, the Houthis launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and elsewhere.",
      "Yemen's civil war, meanwhile, further internationalized, as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \u201cdirectly supporting\u201d Houthi attacks \u2014 a claim Beijing declined to directly comment on. And a second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, which America has linked to the Yemen campaign, is due to happen Saturday in Rome.",
      "The Ras Isa port, a collection of oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. It is just off Kamaran Island, which has been targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the past few days.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath, showing corpses strewn across the site and smashed tanker trucks ablaze.",
      "Satellite images of the port from Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles. Oil also appeared to be leaking into the Red Sea. Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with Dutch peace organization PAX, said it appeared at least three fuel storage tanks had been destroyed and that oil had leaked from mooring pipelines.",
      "The port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate, which is held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.",
      "Ras Isa takes in gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas for the Houthis. The damage from the airstrikes could seriously affect life in Houthi-held areas of Yemen.",
      "The Houthis denounced the U.S. attack as a \u201ccompletely unjustified aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades,\" the Houthis said in a statement.",
      "On April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen, saying it would \u201cnot tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis.\u201d",
      "The attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis that hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel, including Ras Isa.",
      "The airstrike on the port is the deadliest known attack yet in Trump's campaign against the Houthis. The actual cost in lives is hard to assess, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a think tank.",
      "\u201cSince they are targeting civilian areas, there\u2019s a lot more victims. But it\u2019s also difficult to assess how many because the Houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims ... or tend to stress only the civilian victims,\u201d Nevola said.",
      "Further complicating the situation is the U.S. strikes hitting military targets, said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert at the Basha Report risk advisory firm. He pointed to an American attack that Trump highlighted online with black-and-white strike footage, which might have killed about 70 fighters.",
      "\u201cAlthough the Houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering, they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty, strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters,\u201d al-Basha said. \u201cHowever, the overnight strike on the Ras Isa Fuel Port marks the first mass-casualty incident the Houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \u201cdirectly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Bruce did not elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a report by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People\u2019s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.",
      "Bruce said \u201cBeijing's support ... of the satellite company\u201d \u201ccontradicts their claims of being peace supporters.\u201d",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, responding to a question about the allegation, said Friday: \u201cI am not familiar with the situation you mentioned.\" However, he insisted China is seen as urging countries \u201cto make more efforts conducive to regional peace and stability.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince the escalations in the Red Sea situation, China has been playing a positive role in de-escalating the situation,\u201d Lin said. \u201cWho is promoting talks for peace and de-escalating the tensions, and who is imposing sanctions and pressure?\u201d",
      "Chang Guang did not respond to request for comment. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the company in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine.",
      "It remains unclear whether Chang Guang is linked to the Chinese government. The U.S. government in the past has used images taken by American commercial satellite companies to share with allies, like Ukraine, to avoid releasing its own top-secret pictures.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden. The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",

    "story": [
      "The chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH has called for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States, saying that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, called on Thursday for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States and said that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries.",
      "His remarks, in the wake of the tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, appeared to echo a similar call by Elon Musk on April 5 for a zero-tariff zone between the U.S. and EU. The EU has long pushed for a \u201czero-for-zero\u201d trade agreement \u2014 with both sides dropping tariffs \u2014 but Trump has rejected the offer.",
      "Speaking at LVMH\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Arnault said European leaders should negotiate \u201ccleverly\u201d with the U.S. administration and that national governments should take a more prominent role instead of than leaving negotiations solely in the hands of Brussels, the center of EU\u2019s \u201cbureaucratic power.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s LVMH has for decades been the world\u2019s dominant luxury group \u2014 known for products such as Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Champagne, Hennessy Cognac, Louis Vuitton handbags and Dior perfumes \u2014 but this week lost its title as the world\u2019s largest luxury company to rival Herm\u00e8s.",
      "\u201cEurope is not run by a political power, but by a bureaucratic power that spends its time issuing regulations that are unfortunately imposed on all member states and that penalize our business sectors,\u201d the 76-year-old CEO said.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, negotiates trade deals on behalf of all 27 member states. The bloc is the largest trading entity in the world.",
      "LVMH shares fell 7.8% earlier this week, following an unexpected drop in first-quarter sales.",
      "Arnault said the company may be forced to expand U.S. operations. \"We would be forced to increase our American production to avoid tariffs if Europe failed to negotiate with intelligence,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2019, LVMH shifted part of its production to the U.S. by opening a Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas, during Trump\u2019s first term. Trump and Arnault toured the facility together, promoting it as a symbol of U.S. manufacturing revival.",
      "But on Thursday, Arnault admitted the Texas site has underperformed so far. According to documents presented at the meeting, the U.S. accounts for 25% of LVMH\u2019s total sales.",
      "Arnault also criticized France\u2019s proposed corporate tax increases, calling them a \u201ctax on \u2018Made in France\u2019\u201d and warned they could push companies to relocate abroad.",
      "He praised the U.S. model, citing lower taxes and state-backed industrial investment. \u201cWhen you come back to France after spending a few days in the U.S., it\u2019s a bit of a cold shower,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the Louvre Museum conference hall, where the meeting took place, dozens of protesters demanded higher taxes on the wealthy, carrying a \u201cTax the rich\u201d sign alongside and a large puppet of Arnault depicted as a thief, a rope around his chest and hands tied behind his back.",
      "\u201cA tax of 2% on the wealth of France\u2019s ultra-rich could bring in up to \u20ac25 billion a year,\u201d said Fanny Petitbon, a spokesperson for the group 350.org. \u201cThat would be enough to invest in public services and accelerate an energy transition that benefits everyone.\u201d",

      "The world economy\u2019s resilience is being tested \u201cby the reboot of the global trading system\u201d that threatens to cause turbulence in financial markets, Georgieva said.",

      "Georgieva added that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly. Due to the complexity of supply chains, the cost of a single item can be affected by tariffs in dozens of countries, she said.",
      "Increased trade barriers also tend to immediately impact growth, and while it can lead to more domestic production, that takes time to implement, she added.",
      "In its most recent projections issued in January, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow nominally faster and for inflation to come down, though it warned that outlook was clouded by President Donald Trump's policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports.",
      "The Washington-based lending agency said at the time that it expected the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024.",
      "Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, was forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026.",
      "However, in a blog post that accompanied those projections, the fund\u2019s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce \u201care likely to push inflation higher in the near term.\u2019\u2019",
      "Those forecasts from January are expected to change \u2014 possibly significantly \u2014 as Trump's trade war has escalated in recent months, particularly with the U.S.'s biggest trade partner, China.",
      "Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats \u2014 leading to more volatility in the stock market \u2014 but has been in a tit-for-tat tariff battle with China and has shown no sign of backing down. Each time Trump has raised tariffs on China, Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.",

      "During a meeting with the Argentina and Italy national teams shortly after he was elected, Francis noted the influence of athletes, especially on youth, and told the players to remember that, \u201cfor better or worse\u201d they are role models. \u201cDear players, you are very popular.

    "story": [
      "The days of running backs being the headliners at the NFL draft are long in the past with the league\u2019s shift to more passing leading to quarterbacks, pass rushers and pass blockers dominating the top of the draft each year",
      "The days of running backs being the headliners at the NFL draft are long in the past with the league's shift to more passing leading to quarterbacks, pass rushers and pass blockers dominating the top of the draft each year.",
      "The ingredients could be in place for a bit of a change this year thanks to one of the deepest classes of running backs in years following a season when game-changing backs such as Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry became the biggest free agent hits.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid, running back was arguably the most important position on the field,\" Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said at the scouting combine. \u201cI grew up a Cowboys fan \u2014 Tony Dorsett, Emmitt Smith, guys like that were my idols. Then we went through this period over the last five, 10 years, where the analytics certainly de-emphasized the position. I think last year, you saw the impact that some of these guys had. ... I think (running backs) are looked at as probably replaceable by some people, but if you have a great one, you've got a historic one, you just can't replace those guys.\"",
      "The big question headed into the draft Thursday is whether teams view prospects such as Boise State's Ashton Jeanty and North Carolina's Omarion Hampton as those types of backs worthy of being taken with a premium pick.",
      "Jeanty was projected in the final AP mock draft to go sixth to Las Vegas, which would be the highest pick for a running back since Barkley was taken second overall in 2018 by the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cWe just saw Saquon Barkley just change the Eagles in one year,\u201d Raiders GM John Spytek said. \"Now they had a great team around him and it was adding an elite player. I think when you sit where we sit, I mean the idea is to add elite players at any position. I don\u2019t try to devalue any certain position. ... There\u2019s certain ways to build a team, and I don\u2019t know where we got to a place where we don\u2019t feel like running backs are valued. I come from the University of Michigan to my core, and those guys were certainly really valued there. So, it\u2019s hard for me to get away from that.\u201d",
      "Only one running back in the past six drafts was taken in the top 10 with Bijan Robinson going eighth to Atlanta in 2023. Five running backs were top-10 picks from 2015-18 with two being taken that high in 2017 when Leonard Fournette went fourth and Christian McCaffrey went eighth.",
      "It's a far cry from earlier eras when running backs were often the top overall pick, including four times in five seasons from 1977-81. No running back has gone first overall since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995.",
      "Teams have been waiting later and later to take running backs with Jonathan Brooks the first to go last year at No. 46 to Carolina. There has been just an average of two running backs taken in the top 50 in the past six drafts, down from a peak of 12 in 1990.",
      "This year's class of running backs is one of the deepest in recent memory with several players after Jeanty and Hampton projected to be picked either late in the first round or on day two of the draft including Ohio State's duo of TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins; Iowa's Kaleb Johnson; Arizona State's Cam Skattebo, Tennessee's Dylan Sampson; Virginia Tech's Bhayshul Tuten; and Central Florida's RJ Harvey.",
      "The shift from a running to a passing league began with rule changes in 1978 that made passing easier and has continued for more than four decades.",
      "The rate of running dropped from a post-merger high of nearly 58% in 1977 to a low of just more than 40% in 2014 before undergoing a slight increase in recent years to 43.4% last season.",
      "But the bell-cow back had mostly disappeared as teams went to a backfield by committee. The league featured 13 players in 2003 who had at least 300 carries in a season \u2014 matching the nine-year combined total from 2015-23.",
      "Six players hit the 300-carry mark last season led by Barkley and Henry for the most in a season since 2010.",
      "\u201cFor a while, the market maybe was suppressed. People were not looking at them as weapons,\" Bills GM Brandon Beane said. \"I kind of look for them as anyone you add to your offense, what do they bring? What is their skill set? Is it a mismatched player? ... Someone asked, I think a year or two ago, what is your philosophy? Would you draft a running back in the first round? I probably wouldn\u2019t draft a running back that is 3 yards and a cloud of dust, but if it\u2019s a weapon like some of these guys were talking about, heck yeah I would.\u201d",
      "With the diminished role of the featured back, the pay at the position has also suffered with Josh Jacobs\u2019 running back-leading $48 million deal with Green Bay ranking tied for 159th among all players. The $13.6 million franchise tag number for running backs \u2014 determined by the highest-paid players at each position \u2014 is the lowest of any position outside of specialists.",
      "The rookie wage scale put in place in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement determines salaries for the first four seasons solely on draft position, leading teams to use premium picks on high-value positions such as quarterback, tackle, pass rushers and receivers in order to save money compared to veteran contracts.",
      "That\u2019s a big factor that is hard for some teams to overcome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting conversation, because the draft pick is about potential ceiling, ability to play at a certain level, while you have those years under contract below free agency market level, your ability to sustain a second contract,\u201d Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these questions that come into that answer before you pull the card.\u201d",

      "When Luka Doncic scored 16 points in the first quarter of his playoff debut with his new team, the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 downtown arena crackled with excitement from fans imagining dream scenarios for their new superstar this spring",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When Luka Doncic scored 16 points in the first quarter of his playoff debut with his new team, the Los Angeles Lakers' downtown arena crackled with excitement from fans probably imagining dream scenarios for their team and its new superstar this spring.",
      "The Timberwolves made sure that dream got ugly quite quickly in Game 1. They also left the Lakers looking for ways to help Doncic before Minnesota runs away with this first-round series.",
      "Doncic scored 37 points and eight rebounds, but it wasn't nearly enough to counter the Wolves' balanced scoring in their 117-95 victory Saturday night.",
      "After an impressive start by their Slovenian superstar, the Lakers were comprehensively embarrassed during their first postseason Game 1 in front of a full home arena since 2012. Los Angeles didn't demonstrate the toughness necessary to hang with the physical, veteran Wolves on defense \u2014 and only Doncic produced an impressive game on offense.",
      "The combination led to a 27-point deficit in the second half and a laugher of a victory for the Wolves, who immediately seized homecourt advantage in the series after finishing just one win behind the Lakers in the regular season.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a great opponent,\u201d JJ Redick said after losing his playoff coaching debut. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the best teams in basketball. It\u2019s not to say our guys weren\u2019t ready to withstand playoff-level basketball. We were mentally ready, and I thought our spirit was right. ... I\u2019m not sure physically we were ready, if that makes sense. When they start playing with a lot of thrust and physicality, we really just couldn\u2019t respond to that.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's superior physicality was obvious for long stretches, even with Rudy Gobert playing only 24 minutes. But the Wolves took control and kept it largely because they hit 21 3-pointers on only 42 attempts.",
      "The Lakers lack a dominant big man after trading Anthony Davis, and Jaden McDaniels took advantage of that while scoring 25 points. But that doesn't explain the Lakers' poor effort on the perimeter, where they have enough athletes to guard most teams competently when they make the effort.",
      "\u201cI think it was physical, (and) they were hitting a lot of 3s,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cWe have to limit their 3s, especially their lasers. We weren\u2019t physical. They were running. They were getting anything they want, and we have to be better.\u201d",
      "Doncic knew that applied to him personally on the offensive end despite his gaudy point total: The gifted passer had just one assist, his lowest total since Game 1 of last season's NBA Finals.",
      "LeBron James also got off to an unimpressive start to his 18th NBA postseason, scoring 19 points and going 1 for 5 on 3-point attempts while producing only three assists and five rebounds in 36 minutes.",
      "The 40-year-old James can't be shaken by one loss, and he focused on clear areas for improvement in Game 2 on Tuesday. He particularly lamented the Lakers' transition defense, which allowed 25 fast-break points.",
      "\u201cThroughout the whole season we did a great job of not allowing teams to get fast break point after fast break point,\u201d James said. \u201cWe already know offensively how dangerous they are, so in giving teams an opportunity to get those easy points, it\u2019s gonna be hard to make that up.\u201d",
      "The Lakers' crowd stayed in the game throughout the night, but the huge second-half deficit obviously dampened the excitement. Minnesota star Anthony Edwards wasn't exactly complimentary about that crowd after the Wolves cruised to victory, either",
      "\u201cAn atmosphere like this, it\u2019s easy for me, man,\" Edwards said. \"I\u2019ve played in Denver, man. Denver is a tough place to play on the road. So I mean, it was nothing.\u201d",

      "MacKinnon scored on a shot that deflected off Stars defenseman Ilya Lyubushkin, and knuckled past goalie Jake Oettinger late in the second period. That came during an extended power play, a double minor against the Stars after he took a high stick to the face.",

      "Those deals included the Avalanche trading Mikko Rantanen on Jan. 24 to Carolina in the East, He played only 13 games before a deadline deal March 7 sent him back to the Central Division with the Stars and included a $96 million, eight-year contract extension.",
      "Rantanen, who had 101 points (34 goals, 67 assists) in 81 playoff games for the Avalanche had three shots and one block over 18 minutes in his postseason debut with the Stars.",

      "Instagram is expanding its use of artificial intelligence to determine if kids are lying about their ages on the app, parent company Meta Platforms said on Monday",
      "Instagram is beginning to test the use of artificial intelligence to determine if kids are lying about their ages on the app, parent company Meta Platforms said on Monday.",
      "Meta has been using AI to determine people's ages for some time, the company said, but photo and video-sharing app will now \u201cproactively\u201d look for teen accounts it suspects belong to teenagers even if they entered an inaccurate birthdate when they signed up.",
      "If it is determined that a user is misrepresenting their age, the account will automatically become a teen account, which has more restrictions than an adult account. Teen accounts are private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. \u201cSensitive content,\u201d such as videos of people fighting or those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited, Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a \u201csleep mode\u201d will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m.",
      "Meta says it trains its AI to look for signals, such as the type of content the account interacts, profile information and when the account was created, to determine the owner's age.",
      "The heightened measures arrive as social media companies face increased scrutiny over how their platform affects the mental health and well-being of younger users. A growing number of states are also trying to pass age verification laws, although they have faced court challenges.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don\u2019t do enough to make their products safe for children \u2014 or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "Instagram will also send notifications to parents \u201cwith information about how they can have conversations with their teens on the importance of providing the correct age online,\" the company said.",

      "As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry\u2019s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn\u2019t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House less than 100 days ago",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other potentially detrimental actions.",
      "It's the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when they assembled behind Trump as he was sworn in.",
      "That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunities in artificial intelligence and deal-making.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s policies so far have vexed Big Tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies \u2014 a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20.",
      "The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.",
      "That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives",
      "Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump's tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators' allegations that Meta has been running an illegal monopoly in social networking, and working to persuade a federal judge to break up Google after its search engine last year was found to be illegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that aim to hobble Apple and Amazon.",
      "And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company to record a $5.5 billion charge to account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country.",
      "Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies\u2019 financial reports for the January-March quarter.",
      "The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the same time last year.",
      "The decline occurred against a backdrop of vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies.",
      "After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a XX% decrease in Tesla's market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: Amazon on April 29; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Apple on May 1.",
      "Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results.",

      "Google will confront an existential threat Monday as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into a ruthless monopoly.",
      "The drama will unfold in a Washington courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser.",
      "The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade.",
      "After the case finally went to trial in 2023, a federal judge last year ruled Google had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software.",
      "That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google\u2019s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers.",
      "Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. \u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.\u201d",
      "Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden's term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google's immense power as a threat to freedom, too.",
      "\u201cThe American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and \u2018free\u2019 online services,\" the Justice Department wrote in a March 7 filing with Mehta. \u201cThese values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist.\"",
      "Google is arguing the government's proposed changes are unwarranted under a ruling that its search engine popularity among consumers is one of the main reasons it has become so dominant.",
      "The \u201cunprecedented array of proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\u201d Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. \u201cThey bear little or no relationship to the conduct found anticompetitive, and are contrary to the law.\u201d",
      "Google also is sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. \u201cThe breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers.\"",
      "The showdown over Google's fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals.",
      "The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup \u2014 a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court.",
      "Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta's ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can't do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day.",
      "The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social media in another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against both Apple and Amazon, too.",
      "The Justice Department also targeted Google's digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week in another federal judge's decision that found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year.",

    "story": [
      "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
      "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena -- Whale sharks shouldn't be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous \u2014 they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers.",
      "But they somehow manage to also be very private: Scientists don't know where they mate, and they've never observed it before.",
      "They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters around St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean where Napoleon Bonaparte was once exiled and died. It's the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers \u2014 and food doesn\u2019t seem to be the main attraction.",
      "Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he\u2019s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and \u201cdisplaying themselves\u201d to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day we haven\u2019t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.\u201d",
      "Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.",
      "Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been \u201clargely depleted.\u201d",
      "Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position.",
      "Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That's not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present.",
      "Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water's surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists.",
      "Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can\u2019t withstand the pressure.",
      "\u201cWe have some very tantalizing and teasing video,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.\u201d",
      "Perry isn\u2019t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. \u201cIt\u2019s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.\u201d",
      "Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he\u2019s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was \u201cthe sharky equivalent of an erection.\u201d",
      "\"These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,\u201d said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,\u201d Dove said.",
      "Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers\u2019 presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks\u2019 mating practices.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- America\u2019s only rare earths mine heard from anxious companies soon after China responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs this month by limiting exports of those minerals used for military applications and in many high-tech devices.",
      "\u201cBased on the number of phone calls we\u2019re receiving, the effects have been immediate,\u201d said Matt Sloustcher, a spokesperson for MP Materials, the company that runs the Mountain Pass mine in California's Mojave Desert.",
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can\u2019t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.",
      "Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.",
      "MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.",
      "\u201cSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,\u201d MP Materials said in a statement.",
      "Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.",
      "The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.",
      "Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.",
      "\u201cOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,\u201d Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.",
      "China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.",
      "The restrictions Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.",
      "Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm Greenland and Ukraine into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.",
      "Two companies are trying to develop mines in Nebraska and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "\u201cAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,\" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. \"And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.\"",
      "MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.",
      "Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about how dependent they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.",
      "Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.",
      "A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses \u201cthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers\u2019 missions.\u201d",
      "Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.",
      "Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.",
      "Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry a temporary reprieve.",
      "The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.",
      "NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the Export-Import Bank that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.",
      "But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.",

      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google\u2019s namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google\u2019s ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration, the same agency went after the company\u2019s lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden\u2019s ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called \u201cremedy\u201d hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",

      "LONDON -- Astronomers have found possible chemical signs of life on a distant planet outside our solar system, though they caution more work is needed to confirm their findings.",
      "The research, led by scientists at the University of Cambridge, detected evidence of compounds in the exoplanet's atmosphere that on Earth are only produced by living organisms and contended it's the strongest potential signal yet of life.",
      "Independent scientists described the findings as interesting, but not nearly enough to show the existence of life on another planet.",
      "\u201cIt is the strongest sign to date of any possibility of biological activity outside the solar system,\" Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan said during a livestream on Thursday.",
      "By analyzing data from NASA and the European Space Agency's Webb Space Telescope, the researchers found evidence of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of the planet known as K2-18b. The planet is 124 light-years away; one light-year is equivalent to nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "On Earth, those two compounds are produced primarily by microbial life, such as marine phytoplankton.",
      "The planet is more than double Earth\u2019s size and more than 8 times more massive. It's in the so-called habitable zone of its star. The study appeared in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan stressed that further research is needed to rule out any errors or the possibility of other processes, besides living organisms, that could produce the compounds.",
      "David Clements, an astrophysicist at Imperial College London, said atmospheres on other planets are complex and difficult to understand, especially with the limited information available from a planet so far away.",
      "\u201cThis is really interesting stuff and, while it does not yet represent a clear detection of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, it is a step in the right direction,\u201d he said in comments released by the Science Media Center in London.",
      "More than 5,500 planets orbiting other stars have been confirmed so far. Thousands more are in the running out of the billions out there in our Milky Way galaxy alone.",

      "A new global survey finds that endangered sea turtles show signs of recovery in a majority of places where they\u2019re found worldwide",
      "WASHINGTON -- Endangered sea turtles show signs of recovery in a majority of places where they\u2019re found worldwide, according to a new global survey released Thursday.",
      "\u201cMany of the turtle populations have come back, though some haven\u2019t,\u201d said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. \u201cOverall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.\"",
      "The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development and climate change to the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found.",
      "But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species.",
      "Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.",
      "Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal \u2013 with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found.",
      "\u201cBy ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well\u201d in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle Mar\u00eda Early Capistr\u00e1n, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries.",
      "Sea turtles were protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, and Mexico banned all captures of sea turtles in 1990. But it took a few decades for the results of these actions \u2013 alongside efforts to protect nesting beaches and reduce accidental bycatch in fishing \u2013 to show up in population trends, she said.",
      "Around the world, the problem of sea turtles dying after accidentally becoming entangled in fishing gear remains a major threat, said Wallace. New technologies are being developed to spare turtles, but they must be accepted and used regularly by diverse fishing communities to be effective, he added.",
      "The survey was published in the journal Endangered Species Research and is the first update in more than a decade.",

      "HAVANA -- For Sonia P\u00e9rez, stepping into Havana\u2019s Do\u00f1a Alicia restaurant felt like entering a movie. Even as Cuba struggles with power outages and technological scarcity, this eatery has leaped into the 21st century with digital menus, Alexa-enabled assistance, touchless bathrooms and even a food-delivering robot.",
      "\u201cI thought I was in a cartoon movie!\u201d said the 64-year-old government employee, marvelling at the contrast with the technological realities outside. \u201cI wish there were more of these in Cuba... We are really very behind in technology.\u201d",
      "While commonplace globally, such automation is a complex feat in Cuba due to the island\u2019s frequent power cuts and a lack of modern technology.",
      "Opened seven years ago, the restaurant gradually embraced technology, starting with tablets at tables, followed by Alexa services and culminating in the arrival of Do\u00f1a Alicia \u2014 a food-delivering robot named after the owner\u2019s grandmother \u2014 who now assists human waiters in the dining room.",
      "Guests are greeted with digital menus on screens at their tables, allowing them to browse and order traditional Cuban dishes such as savory pork steak, pasta and sweet desserts. The bar further enhances the experience offering drinks such as mojitos or freshly made daiquiris. Human servers are on hand for those less tech-savvy.",
      "The prices align with those of other private restaurants, making them unaffordable for the average Cuban and reflecting the island's inflation.",
      "Despite the challenges of limited and often unreliable internet access in Cuba (mobile internet only became widespread in 2018, and outages are frequent due to the energy crisis), Do\u00f1a Alicia appears to be navigating these obstacles.",
      "Manager Yadiel Hern\u00e1ndez believes the technological advancements help attract customers by creating a unique and appealing dining experience in Havana.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a change,\u201d said Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cBoth children and adults find it interesting to have a robotic assistant bring food to the table...it's a novel experience.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration plans to rewrite part of the Endangered Species Act that prohibits harming the habitats of endangered and threatened species",
      "The Trump administration plans to eliminate habitat protections for endangered and threatened species in a move environmentalists say would lead to the extinction of critically endangered species due to logging, mining, development and other activities.",
      "At issue is a longstanding definition of \u201charm\u201d in the Endangered Species Act, which has included altering or destroying the places those species live. Habitat destruction is the biggest cause of extinction, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service said in a proposed rule issued Wednesday that habitat modification should not be considered harm because it's not the same as intentionally targeting a species, called \u201ctake.\u201d Environmentalists argue that the definition of \u201ctake,\u201d though, has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of \u201charm\u201d has been upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The proposed rule \u201ccuts the heart out of the Endangered Species Act,\u201d said Greenwald. \u201cIf (you) say harm doesn\u2019t mean significant habitat degradation or modification, then it really leaves endangered species out in the cold.\u201d",
      "For example, he said spotted owls and Florida panthers both are protected because the current rule forbids habitat destruction. But if the new rule is adopted, someone who logs in a forest or builds a development would be unimpeded as long as they could say they didn't intend to harm an endangered species, he said.",
      "The proposed rule was expected to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday, kicking off a 30-day public comment period.",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman referred The Associated Press to the Department of Interior, which declined to comment.",
      "Environmental groups will challenge the rule in court if it is adopted, said Drew Caputo, an attorney at Earthjustice.",
      "He said the proposal \u201cthreatens a half-century of progress in protecting and restoring endangered species,\u201d including bald eagles, gray wolves, Florida manatees and humpback whales. He said that's because the current rule \u201crecognizes the common-sense concept that destroying a forest, beach, river, or wetland that a species relies on for survival constitutes harm to that species.\u201d",
      "The question is whether the Trump administration is entitled to repeal a rule that was upheld specifically by the Supreme Court and therefore subject to precedent, said Patrick Parenteau, an emeritus professor at the Vermont Law and Graduate School who has handled endangered species cases.",
      "Because of the current definition of harm, \u201cmany, many millions of acres of land has been conserved\u201d to help keep species alive, he said.",

      "Birds are among the most vulnerable. Since humans arrived, 71 birds have gone extinct, according to the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

      "WASHINGTON -- Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies \u2014 not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial.",
      "Zuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon. He took questions from Meta attorney Mark Hansen, who has argued that his client hardly has a monopoly in social media, as the FTC claims, and still faces stiff global competition.",
      "Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.",
      "Zuckerberg said he\u2019s very focused on inventing new things, and understanding what other people are creating is a big part of the process. At any given point in his company\u2019s history, he said, similar tones of concern could be found in emails about what other companies were doing better than his.",
      "\u201cThis is my job,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I need to understand what is going on, and I need to push our teams to move quickly\u201d to learn about what is going on in a very competitive market.",
      "Hansen questioned Zuckerberg about competition, particularly from TikTok, the popular social media site owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and the the growth of the video-sharing platform YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.",
      "Zuckerberg testified that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined.",
      "While Hansen noted that the FTC doesn't consider YouTube to be a Meta competitor \u2014 because it doesn't have the same friend-sharing technology as Facebook \u2014 Zuckerberg said YouTube has built in ways to share videos.",
      "The FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. The case could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, the FTC's attorney who questioned Zuckerberg, has repeatedly brought up his own words in emails to associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram to try to show Zuckerberg was more interested halting Instagram's alarming growth than improving the product.",

      "Hansen noted that the FTC is making similar claims about the acquisition of the messaging app WhatsApp: that Zuckerberg was afraid of the company's potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something I thought about,\" Zuckerberg said, noting the app's formidable capabilities, but he added that he later learned not to be worried because the owners didn't share the same vision or direction.",
      "He said his interest in buying it was \u201cthe usage of it.\u201d",

The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",

Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",

      "WASHINGTON -- At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they'd discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.",
      "In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.",
      "\u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d",
      "The speed and scope of the federal government's efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.",
      "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.",
      "Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.",
      "Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.",
      "Students have filed similar lawsuits in several other states, arguing they were denied due process.",
      "In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa.",
      "At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d",
      "Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.",
      "Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.",
      "Still others caught in legal limbo aren't students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on \u201coptional practical training,\u201d a one-year period \u2014 or up to three for science and technology graduates \u2014 that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.",
      "Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this \u201coptional practical training.\u201d About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.",
      "Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.",
      "\u201cWe have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,\u201d said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.",

      "Two Belgian teenagers have been charged in Kenya with wildlife piracy after they were found with thousands of ants packed in test tubes in what Kenyan authorities said was part of a trend in trafficking smaller and lesser known species",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two Belgian teenagers were charged Tuesday with wildlife piracy after they were found with thousands of ants packed in test tubes in what Kenyan authorities said was part of a trend in trafficking smaller and lesser known species.",
      "Lornoy David and Seppe Lodewijckx, two 19-year-olds who were arrested on April 5 with 5,000 ants at a guest house, appeared distraught during their appearance before a magistrate in Nairobi and were comforted in the courtroom by relatives. They told the magistrate they were collecting the ants for fun and did not know that it was illegal.",
      "In a separate criminal case, Kenyan Dennis Ng\u2019ang\u2019a and Vietnamese Duh Hung Nguyen also were charged with illegal trafficking in the same courtroom, following their arrest while in possession of 400 ants.",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service said the four men were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia, and that the species included messor cephalotes, a distinctive, large and red-colored harvester ant native to East Africa.",
      "The illegal export of the ants \"not only undermines Kenya\u2019s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,\u201d KWS said in a statement.",
      "Kenya has in the past fought against the trafficking of body parts of larger species of wild animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins among others. But the cases against the four men represent \"a shift in trafficking trends \u2014 from iconic large mammals to lesser-known yet ecologically critical species,\u201d KWS said.",
      "The two Belgians were arrested in Kenya\u2019s Nakuru county, which is home to various national parks. The 5,000 ants were found in a guest house where they were staying, and were packed in 2,244 test tubes that had been filled with cotton wool to enable the ants to survive for months.",
      "The other two men were arrested in Nairobi where they were found to have 400 ants in their apartments.",
      "Kenyan authorities valued the ants at 1 million shillings ($7,700). The prices for ants can vary greatly according to the species and the market.",
      "Philip Muruthi, a vice president for conservation at the Africa Wildlife Foundation in Nairobi, said ants play the role of enriching soils, enabling germination and providing food for species such as birds.",
      "\u201cThe thing is, when you see a healthy forest, like Ngong forest, you don\u2019t think about what is making it healthy. It is the relationships all the way from the bacteria to the ants to the bigger things,\u201d he said.",
      "Muruthi warned of the risk of trafficking species and exporting diseases to the agricultural industry of the destination countries.",
      "\u201cEven if there is trade, it should be regulated and nobody should be taking our resources just like that,\u201d he said.",

He also experienced two episodes of \"acute respiratory failure\" in early March, according to the Vatican, that required \"noninvasive mechanical ventilation\" at night to help him breathe.",
      "Pope Francis was released from the hospital and returned to the Vatican on March 23, where his physicians said he would require additional months of recovery. Two weeks later, he made his first public appearance since his discharge from the hospital, sitting in a wheelchair while using supplemental oxygen as he briefly greeted people in St. Peter's Square. He also made an appearance on Easter Sunday from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, following a earlier meeting with Vice President JD Vance.",

As he grew older, he began to experience gastrointestinal issues that led to a section of his colon being surgically removed in 2021 because of intestinal inflammation. He also began using a wheelchair and cane in 2023 because of strained knee ligaments and a small knee fracture that made walking and standing difficult.",

      "Like his namesake, the pontiff earned a reputation for living a humble life and eschewing the pomp of his predecessors. While Pope Benedict XVI had a flair for papal fashion, Francis chose the simple white cassock with few embellishments for everyday wear. When he was elected pope on March 13, 2013, he didn't send an aide to pay his hotel bill in Rome, but took care of it himself.",

He once welcomed a child with Down syndrome to sit next to him, and held her hand while he delivered a speech.",
      "Francis also chose not to live in the ornate papal apartments, preferring instead to reside with others in the simple quarters of the Vatican guest house. Rather than travel in a limousine, he made a point of traveling about in smaller, more ordinary vehicles when leaving the Vatican and on his trips.",

      "Stricken with a lung infection as a teenager, Bergoglio ultimately had part of his right lung removed at age 21. He went on to hold various odd jobs, including working as a bouncer at a club, sweeping floors, and running tests in a chemical laboratory, before deciding to join the Jesuit order in 1958, becoming a priest just shy of 12 years later.",
      "The same sense of social justice he embodied as Pope Francis can be traced back to when the pontiff was the archbishop of Buenos Aires. He made a name for himself then by reportedly leading a simple life \u2013 preparing his own meals, living in a spartan apartment and riding public transportation \u2013 eschewing the luxurious lifestyle typically associated with his position.",
      "As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis in 2012 notably criticized priests who refused to baptize children born out of wedlock.",
      "\"They are the hypocrites of today,\" said Francis. \"They turn God\u2019s people away from salvation. And that poor girl who could have sent her child back to the sender but had the courage to bring him into the world goes on pilgrimage from parish to parish to have him baptized.\u201d",
      "Outreach as pope",
      "From the start, Pope Francis' tenure was marked by a more populist ministry than that of his predecessors, demonstrated both by his outreach to groups traditionally ignored or criticized by the church, and his broader efforts to reform and contemporize the church itself.",
      "On his first trip after becoming pope, Francis chose symbolically to travel to the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa, in southern Italy, one of the first points of entry into Europe for poor and desperate refugees and migrants from North Africa, who risk their lives to make the crossing in often unsafe vessels. He also used his first Christmas address as pontiff to call on people to \"place ourselves at the service of the poor, make ourselves small and poor with them.\"",
      "In a February 2016 mass delivered on the U.S.-Mexico border, and with anti-immigrant sentiments on the rise, the pope called for people in the U.S. and around the world to keep \"open hearts\" regarding immigrants fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands.",
      "With the church under broadside criticism for sex-abuse scandals involving prominent clergy, Pope Francis both met with and apologized to sex abuse victims, calling them \"heralds of mercy\" and acknowledging that the church had failed them, declaring, \"God weeps.\"",
      "Francis also criticized the church itself for what he called its obsession with issues including same-sex marriage, abortion and contraception, although he stopped short of challenging the church's traditional positions on them.",
      "When a journalist asked him a question about gay priests on his first foreign trip in 2013, just four months after his election, Francis stunned people with his response: \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "As recently as August of 2023, Francis reiterated in comments during World Youth Day in Portugal that the Catholic Church is for \"everyone,\" including LGBTQ+ people, although they were still excluded from the sacraments. The following December, Francis approved a Vatican declaration titled \"On the Pastoral Meaning of Blessings\" which noted that, while the church's official policy remained opposed to same-sex marriage, \"when people ask for a blessing, an exhaustive moral analysis should not be placed as a precondition for conferring it. For, those seeking a blessing should not be required to have prior moral perfection.\"",
      "Health problems",
      "Pope Francis' respiratory health was a lifelong issue for him; he had part of one lung removed at age 21 because of a respiratory infection. As he grew older, he began to experience gastrointestinal issues, including a bout of diverticulitis that led to a 10-day hospital stay in July 2021, during which time a section of his colon was surgically removed. He also began using a wheelchair and cane in 2023 because of strained knee ligaments and a knee fracture that made walking and standing difficult.",
      "On a flight home from a trip to Canada in July 2022, where he had been using a wheelchair, Francis hinted he would have to slow down future travels and maybe resign one day.",
      "\"This trip was a bit of a test. It's true you can't do trips in this state, maybe we have to change a bit the style, reduce, pay the debts of the trips that I still have to do and reorganize,\" Francis said.",
      "He added that \"the door is open\" for him to resign if he couldn't carry on.",
      "Even so, Francis continued traveling in 2023, with a total of five trips that year despite increasing health issues.",
      "In January of 2023, then-86-year-old Pope Francis revealed his diverticulitis had returned but was being managed. The following March, he was hospitalized for three days with acute bronchitis.",
      "\"I am touched by the many messages received in these hours and I express my gratitude for the closeness and prayer,\" Francis wrote on Twitter at the time.",
      "In June of 2023, Francis was back in the hospital, where he underwent three hours of abdominal surgery to address intestinal blockages caused by scarring from previous surgeries. That following November, the Vatican announced that the pontiff had developed a \"pulmonary inflammation that has caused some breathing difficulties,\" and for which he was being treated with intravenous antibiotics. He subsequently canceled a planned trip to attend a climate conference in Dubai.",
      "Pope Francis' health continued to be an issue into 2024, prompting the cancellation of some events in late February of that year due to what the Vatican press office described as \"mild flu symptoms,\" which also saw him visit Rome's Gemelli Hospital for what the Vatican called \"diagnostic tests.\"",
      "In January 2025, the Vatican announced that Francis had injured his arm in a fall at his residence, suffering \"a bruise to his right forearm, without fractures.\" The Pope was seen using a soft sling to support his arm in a photograph released by the Vatican.",
      "Pope Francis continued to experience respiratory issues and was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 14, 2025 for what the Vatican described as \"necessary tests\" and was subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection, also according to the Vatican, for which he began receiving treatment. Four days later, the Vatican revealed that Francis had been diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, for which he was receiving \"additional drug therapy.\"",
      "\"Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you are accompanying me in these days,\" the pope posted on X on Feb. 16.",
      "Pope Francis subsequently suffered a \"prolonged\" asthmatic respiratory crisis on Feb. 22, according to the Vatican, that required doctors to administer him supplemental oxygen, and that he remained in critical condition. Francis had also received transfusions to address low blood platelets, the Vatican said.",
      "What happens next",
      "A nine-day period of mourning is expected to be observed. The Pope's funeral will be held after his body lies in state for public viewing in St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "During this time, all cardinals under the age of 80 who are eligible to participate are summoned to Rome to prepare for the secret conclave inside the Sistine Chapel to choose the next pontiff, a gathering that typically commences between 15 to 20 days after the pope's death.",
      "The cardinal-electors will cast as many as four ballots in a single day. Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel's chimney will indicate an inconclusive vote, while white smoke will signify a new pope has been elected.",

      "The death of a pope sets in motion a series of carefully orchestrated rites and rituals well before the conclave to elect his successor begins",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The death of a pope sets in motion a series of carefully orchestrated rites and rituals well before the conclave to elect his successor begins. They involve the certification of death and public display of his body for the faithful to pay their respects, followed by the funeral and burial.",
      "Pope Francis, who died on Monday, revised various rites last year, simplifying the funeral rituals to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes. But the core elements remain, including the three key moments that must be observed between the death of a pope and his burial.",
      "The reforms are incorporated into the slim red volume \u201cOrdo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis,\u201d Latin for \u201cRite of Burial for Roman Pontiffs.\u201d",
      "While popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that elects their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites hadn\u2019t been undertaken since 2000.",
      "The changes became necessary after Francis expressed his own wishes, and after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on Dec. 31, 2022. For Benedict, the Vatican had to work out the novelty of a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years.",
      "A few months later, Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican\u2019s master of liturgical ceremonies, Archbishop Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the entire book of rites to simplify them.",
      "In explaining the reforms, Ravelli said the changes aimed \u201cto emphasize even more that the Roman Pontiff\u2019s funeral is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world.\u201d",
      "The three main stations, or moments, occur first in his home, then in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and then in the place of burial.",
      "The reform allows for the formal confirmation of death to occur in Francis\u2019 personal chapel rather than his bedroom. It is unclear why, the change may be more practical than anything since Francis chose to live in a small suite in the Vatican\u2019s Santa Marta hotel rather than the Apostolic Palace. He has a personal chapel at Santa Marta.",
      "Upon the pope\u2019s death, the head of the Vatican health service examines the body, ascertains the cause of death and writes a report. The body is dressed in white.",
      "The body rests in the pope\u2019s personal chapel for the ritual pronouncement of death, presided over by the camerlengo, the Vatican official who runs the Holy See administration between the death or resignation of one pope and the election of another. The camerlengo is American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, one of Francis\u2019 most trusted aides.",
      "In a change from the past, the rite no longer requires the body to be placed in the traditional three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak. Now, the pope\u2019s body is placed in a wooden coffin, with a zinc coffin inside. The pope is dressed in red liturgical vestments, his miter \u2014 the traditional headdress of bishops \u2014 and the pallium woolen stole, a kind of scarf. The Pasqual candle, a large, decorated candle used at Easter, is placed nearby.",
      "The camerlengo drafts the formal declaration of death, attaching the certificate that had been prepared by the health service chief.",
      "The master of liturgical celebrations, Ravelli, then decides when other faithful can pay their respects before the coffin is moved to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing.",
      "When the body is brought into the basilica, the Litany of Saints chant is sung. The camerlengo leads the procession.",
      "In another change, the pope\u2019s body is no longer placed on an elevated bier. Rather, the simplified wooden coffin is placed facing the pews, with the Pasqual candle nearby.",
      "The night before the funeral, the camerlengo presides over the closing and sealing of the coffin, in the presence of other senior cardinals. A white cloth is placed over the pope\u2019s face.",
      "A bag containing coins minted during his papacy is placed in the coffin along with a one-page written account of his papacy \u2014 known in Italian as a \"rogito,\" a word indicating an official deed. It is read aloud by the master of liturgical ceremonies and then rolled up and slipped inside a cylindrical tube that is placed inside the coffin. Another copy is kept in the Vatican archives. The covers of both the zinc coffin and the wooden one bear a cross and the papal coat of arms.",
      "Francis\u2019 coat of arms, which he kept from when he was bishop, features a shield and the monogram of his Jesuit order, with the words \u201cMiserando atque eligendo,\u201d Latin for \u201cHaving had mercy, he called him.\u201d It comes from an episode in the Gospel where Christ picks a seemingly unworthy person to follow him.",
      "The funeral is presided over by the dean of the College of Cardinals or, if that is not possible, by the vice dean or another senior cardinal. The current dean is Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91. The vice dean is Argentine Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 81. Francis earlier this year extended both of their five-year terms rather than appoint new ones.",
      "Francis\u2019 reform allows for burial outside the Vatican, with the camerlengo presiding. Various seals are impressed on the coffin, and it is placed inside the tomb.",
      "Francis has said he wants to be buried not in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica or its grottoes, where most popes are buried, but in the St. Mary Major Basilica across town. His choice reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus Populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).",
      "After every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my great devotion,\u201d Francis told Mexico\u2019s N+ in revealing his future burial plans. \u201cThe place is already prepared.\u201d",
      "With the burial, the Catholic Church begins nine days of official mourning, known as the \u201cnovemdiales\u201d and the conclave begins.",

    "summary": "What to know about electing a new pope after the death of Pope Francis.",
    "story": [
      "The process reflects centuries-old traditions.",
      "The process by which a new pope is elected has undergone numerous changes in the nearly two millennia that the Catholic Church has existed, with the current procedure a combination of ancient traditions and modern updates as recent as 2013, reflecting changes instituted by Pope Benedict XVI. Even so, the essential ritual has remained largely unchanged for centuries.",
      "Pope Francis' death sets into motion a series of formalized rites and observances that occur during what is called the interregnum, which begins upon the pontiff's passing and ends with the election of his successor. The period of time during which the papacy is vacant is known as the sede vacante, Latin for \"vacant seat.\"",
      "The pope's death is first ritually verified by the cardinal camerlengo, or chamberlain, who who runs the ordinary affairs of the Vatican city-state during the sede vacante. A traditional nine days of mourning then commences. This includes the pope's funeral, which per tradition is held within four to six days of his death, after his body lies in state for several days in St. Peter's Basilica. This also allows global dignitaries and heads of state to pay their respects and attend the funeral.",
      "It's also during the interregnum that all cardinals under the age of 80 who are eligible to participate are summoned to Rome to prepare for the secret conclave inside the Sistine Chapel to choose the next pontiff, a gathering that typically commences between 15 to 20 days after the pope's death. The cardinals spend the interregnum housed in private rooms in the Domus Marthae Sanctae -- essentially a residence hotel in the Vatican with dining facilities that usually houses visiting clergy and laity. Per tradition, the cardinals are cut off from the outside world, including televisions, phones, computers and newspapers.",
      "The College of Cardinals will cast as many as four ballots in a single day for the next pope, with a two-thirds majority required to elect a pontiff. After each vote, the ballots are burned and smoke is released from the Sistine Chapel's chimney as a signal to the throngs holding vigil in St. Peter's Square. Black smoke -- fumata nera in Italian -- indicates an inconclusive vote, while white smoke -- fumata bianca -- will signify that a new pope has been elected. If three days pass with no pope elected, voting can be suspended for a day to allow the cardinals time for reflection before the next round of ballots are cast.",
      "Once the College of Cardinals elects a new pope, the candidate is formally asked in the Sistine Chapel if he accepts the election and, if so, to choose his papal name. While popes have the option of keeping their baptismal name, every pope for the last 470 years has chosen to change his name, usually to honor a predecessor and to signal their intention to emulate his example.",
      "The interregnum ends when the newly elected pope makes his first public appearance in his new role, stepping onto the central balcony at St. Peter's Basilica, overlooking St. Peter's Square, to bless the gathered crowd there after being introduced by the senior cardinal deacon with the traditional declaration \"Habemus papum\" \u2013 Latin for \"We have a pope.\"",

      "He was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \u201cmega partnership\u201d with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration\u2019s demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S.",
      "Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a \u201ctariff abuser\u201d and \u201ctariff king.\u201d",
      "The trade negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors.",

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/white-house-covid-web-page-page-supporting-lab/story?id=120956514",
    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 19:30:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The site has been directed to a new landing page that argues for\u00a0the theory that COVID-19 originated from a mistaken lab leak in Wuhan, China.",
    "story": [
      "The website once had resources for vaccines, testing and treatment for COVID-19.",
      "The White House has redirected COVID.gov to a new landing page called \"Lab Leak: True Origins of COVID-19,\" which makes a five-point argument for\u00a0the theory that COVID-19 originated from a mistaken lab leak in Wuhan, China.",
      "The new site appears to use theories from the final report of the Republican-led\u00a0Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic,\u00a0released in December 2024.\u00a0There has never been a consensus or a \"smoking gun\" to explain what started the pandemic.",
      "The COVID.gov page, as recently as last week, listed resources for testing, treatment, and vaccination against COVID-19, as well as information for Long COVID.",
      "The five pieces of evidence put forth by the White House\u00a0for the theory include the following assertions: that the \"virus possesses a biological characteristic that is\u00a0not found in nature,\" that data shows all cases \"stem from\u00a0a single introduction into humans,\" that \"Wuhan is home to China's foremost SARS research lab,\" that researchers at that research lab \"were\u00a0sick with COVID-like symptoms\u00a0in the fall of 2019,\" and that \"if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have\u00a0already surfaced.\"",
      "The page includes claims that government officials, including former NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, helped edit and then amplify\u00a0a research paper\u00a0on the origins of COVID-19 published in 2020 that supported natural origin theory.",
      "The current page suggests this paper's explicit intention was to discredit the lab leak theory and remove any doubt that the origins were of natural origin. This is not a new accusation and in the past\u00a0 Fauci\u00a0and the paper authors disagreed with the accusations that the paper was manipulated or had any specific goal.",
      "The origins of the pandemic have been hotly debated since its start.",
      "The prevailing theories always seemed to focus on two scenarios: either natural exposure to an infected animal or an accidental lab leak.",
      "With no \"smoking gun\" and limited access to raw data, discussion of the science has played out in a haze of circumstantial evidence.",
      "In October 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u00a0released\u00a0a declassified report on the intelligence community's views on the origin conundrum, which also leaned toward a natural spillover, but represented divided views. A subsequent\u00a0declassified report\u00a0released in 2023 also noted that most of the intelligence community was split on the origins of the pandemic.\u00a0In reports, US agencies generally agreed that the virus was most likely not developed as a biological weapon and that China's leaders did not know about the virus before the start of the global pandemic.",
      "The new\u00a0splash page features a photo of Fauci and the pardon that former President Joe Biden granted him, highlighting that it was for \"any offenses.\" The page also accuses federal agencies, including NIH and HHS, of breaking laws and violating rules about transparency and cooperation with Congressional investigation.\u00a0The agencies complied with FOIA requests and other regulatory requests from the committee and also appeared before lawmakers when asked to testify.",
      "The web page also calls into question the efficacy of social distancing, masking and lockdown. The White House also criticized the response from New York officials.",
      "Fauci testified about the accusations before lawmakers in 2024, saying that accusations about him covering up or influencing research about the lab leak theory are untrue.",
      "\"The accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous. I had no input into the content of the published paper,\" Fauci said in June of 2024.",
      "\"The second issue is a false accusation that I tried to cover up the possibility that the virus originated from a lab. In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite,\" Fauci said during that 2024 hearing.",
      "This is not the first time that the White House has made clear its position on the origins of COVID-19. In January, President Trump said that COVID-19 had \"strained\" his relationship with President Xi Jinping of China.",
      "\"But, I like President Xi very much. I've always liked him.\u00a0We always had a very good relationship. It was very strained with COVID coming out of Wuhan. Obviously, that strained it.\u00a0I'm sure it strained it with a lot of people, but that strained our relationship,\" Trump said in remarks to the World Economic Forum.",

      "NEW YORK -- Opponents of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration took to the streets of communities large and small across the U.S. on Saturday, decrying what they see as threats to the nation\u2019s democratic ideals.",
      "The disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration marking the start of the American Revolutionary War 250 years ago. In San Francisco, protesters formed a human banner reading \u201cImpeach & Remove\u201d on the sands of Ocean Beach overlooking the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Thomas Bassford was among those who joined demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside of Boston. \u201cThe shot heard \u2019round the world\u201d on April 19, 1775, heralded the start of the nation\u2019s war for independence from Britain.",

      "\u201cThis is a very perilous time in America for liberty,\" Bassford said, as he attended the event with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. \"I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.\u201d",
      "Elsewhere, protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government. Others organized more community-service events, such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters.",
      "The protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide protests against the Trump administration drew thousands to the streets across the country.",
      "Organizers say they\u2019re protesting what they call Trump\u2019s civil rights violations and constitutional violations, including efforts to deport scores of immigrants and to scale back the federal government by firing thousands of government workers and effectively shutter entire agencies.",
      "Some of the events drew on the spirit of the American Revolutionary War, calling for \u201cno kings\u201d and resistance to tyranny.",
      "Boston resident George Bryant, who was among those protesting in Concord, Massachusetts, said he was concerned Trump was creating a \u201cpolice state\u201d in America as he held up a sign saying, \u201cTrump fascist regime must go now!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s defying the courts. He\u2019s kidnapping students. He\u2019s eviscerating the checks and balances,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThis is fascism.\u201d",
      "In Washington, Bob Fasick said he came out to the rally by the White House out of concern about threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, as well as Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.",
      "The Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shutter Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programs and scale back protections for transgender people.",
      "\u201cI cannot sit still knowing that if I don\u2019t do anything and everybody doesn\u2019t do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbors is simply not one that I would want to live,\u201d said the 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia.",
      "In Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse. They held signs that said \u201cFight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight\u201d and \u201cSave SSA,\u201d in reference to the Social Security Administration.",
      "And in Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants as they marched from the New York Public Library north towards Central Park past Trump Tower.",
      "\u201cNo fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,\u201d they chanted to the steady beat of drums, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Marshall Green, who was among the protesters, said he was most concerned that Trump has invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCongress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,\u201d said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey. \u201cYou cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.\u201d",

      "Tom Homan spoke with \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.",
      "Trump White House border czar Tom Homan stood by the administration's position on the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national the Justice Department said was erroneously deported to a prison in his home country, and waived off responsibility for the migrant's status in an interview with ABC News.",
      "Homan spoke with \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl in an interview that will air this Sunday about the case and repeated the Trump administration's allegations that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member and a violent threat to the public.",
      "\"We removed a public safety threat, a national security threat, a violent gang member from the United States,\" he alleged.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family members have denied that he is a member of MS-13, and the gang allegations are being disputed in court.",
      "Watch more of Jonathan Karl's interview with Tom Homan on \"This Week\" at 9 a.m. Sunday on ABC.",
      "However, much of the evidence that has been cited by President Donald Trump and his allies, such as clothing they argue symbolizes gang membership, has not been brought up in court since the current administration began litigating this case.",
      "The Supreme Court unanimously ordered the administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. for a trial. As of Friday, the administration has not taken active steps to do so.",
      "When asked by Karl about the order, Homan claimed the Trump administration does not have the right or ability to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and argued Abrego Garcia is under the authority of the El Salvador government.",
      "\"I understand that 'facilitate,' but he's also in the custody -- he's a citizen and a national of the country of El Salvador. El Salvador would certainly have to cooperate in that,\" Homan said.",
      "\"But again, I'm out of the loop on that. I'm not an attorney. I'm not litigating this case. We'll do whatever the law says we have to do, but I think and I stand by the fact [that] I think we did the right thing here,\" he said.",
      "Homan also joined Trump and other Republicans in their criticism of Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who traveled to El Salvador this week and met with Abrego Garcia.",
      "\"You know, what bothers me more than that is a U.S. senator traveled to El Salvador on taxpayer dime to meet with an MS-13 gang member, [a] public safety threat, terrorist,\" Homan said, without providing evidence that Van Hollen is using taxpayer money for the trip.",
      "When ABC News reached out to Van Hollen's office for comment on how the trip was funded, his office replied, \"the Senator traveled in his official capacity with bipartisan approval to follow up on the case of a constituent and conduct oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs. He did fly commercial.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime in the U.S., and his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, told ABC News on Wednesday that her husband has \"never been convicted for anything.\"",
      "Homan accused the senator of not taking time to meet with victims of MS-13 gang members in his state and inaction under the Biden administration to address border concerns.",
      "\"What concerns me is Van Hollen never went to the border the last four years under Joe Biden. ... What shocks me is he's remained silent on the travesty that happened on the southern border. Many people died, thousands of people died,\" he said.",
      "Upon returning to the U.S., Van Hollen told reporters his trip was about more than Abrego Garcia's case.",
      "\"This case is not only about one man, as important as that is,\" Van Hollen said. \"It is about protecting fundamental freedoms and the fundamental principle in the Constitution for due process that protects everybody who resides in America.\"",

The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",

The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",

      "Four House Democrats are visiting El Salvador in a bid to support Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man whom the Trump administration deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison",
      "WASHINGTON -- Four House Democratic lawmakers have traveled to El Salvador to call attention to the plight of a man the Trump administration deported to a Salvadoran prison and has refused to help return \u2014 even after the Supreme Court ruled that it was the government's duty to do so.",
      "Reps. Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, Maxine Dexter of Oregon, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Robert Garcia of California arrived in the Central American nation on Sunday to investigate the condition of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had lived in the United States for more than a decade. The Trump administration deported him, a move that administration officials have said in court filings was erroneous.",
      "But despite a Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to help facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, the administration has said it has no power to bring him back, a choice being scrutinized by federal courts as potentially in violation of judicial rulings.",
      "\u201cTo see the Trump administration so blatantly and egregiously defy the Supreme Court and have no regard for due process is extremely alarming to me,\u201d Ansari said in an interview. \u201cEven with all of the illegal actions we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months, I think this is the one that terrifies me the most when it comes to the future of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The quartet\u2019s trip comes after Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland traveled to El Salvador last week and met Abrego Garcia and Salvadoran officials. Abrego Garcia had lived in Maryland with his wife and three children, who are American citizens, before he was deported on March 15.",
      "Abrego Garcia's protected legal status prohibited him from being deported to El Salvador. He was deported on one of three planes filled with alleged migrant gang members.",
      "Garcia said he and Frost sent a letter last week to House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., requesting that an official delegation go to El Salvador to investigate Abrego Garcia's condition and push for his return, but received no response. Ansari said more Democrats would be traveling to El Salvador in the coming days and weeks.",
      "\u201cThose of us in the House who are here greatly admire and support what Sen. Van Hollen did,\u201d Garcia said. Of Abrego Garcia, he said, \u201cHis family knew that he was safe, but he\u2019s not home, and so we\u2019ve got to continue the pressure, and we\u2019ve got to ensure that the rule of law in the United States is allowed.\u201d",
      "Justice Department lawyers said in court last week that they have no power to advance Abrego Garcia\u2019s return because he is in a foreign country\u2019s custody. Administration officials also claimed in public comments that Abrego Garcia was engaged in human trafficking and terrorism and therefore correctly deported. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that if Abrego Garcia were to return to the U.S., \u201che would immediately be deported again.\u201d",
      "Van Hollen unsuccessfully lobbied the Salvadoran government for Abrego Garcia's return. He told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that the United States is facing a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d if the Trump administration does not follow the Supreme Court's order to push to bring Abrego Garcia back.",
      "It's a warning Democrats are increasingly amplifying. Rather than debate President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policy or the merits of the administration's invocation of national security to carry out deportations, Democratic lawmakers are zeroing in on the issue of due process, with some noting that the Supreme Court and lower court federal judges found Abrego Garcia was deported without a proper hearing.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s argument, moreover, implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the court\u2019s ruling in Abrego Garcia's case.",
      "Said Garcia: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to demonize him, and we\u2019re not here to defend him. He deserves due process, and everyone deserves due process. ... What he did or may have done, that has to be decided by a judge.\u201d",
      "Several House Republicans have visited El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center, the prison where Abergo Garcia is being held, and lauded the facility for what they view as El Salvador's tough-on-crime policies. Republican senators and governors have defended Abrego Garcia's detention as part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration. But at least one Republican senator called the administration's deportation of Abrego Garcia a mistake.",
      "\u201cThe administration won\u2019t admit it. But this was a screw-up,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "During a meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office, Trump remarked that \u201chomegrown\u201d lawbreakers should be deported to prisons in the Central American country and urged Bukele to \u201cbuild about five more places\u201d like the notorious penitentiary where Abrego Garcia is now held.",
      "Congressional Republicans have so far shown little interest in negotiating the dispute between the president and the judiciary. Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have little leverage to pressure the White House. But Abrego Garcia's case has become both an alarming and galvanizing case inside the party.",
      "Democrats \"have the power to draw attention to this issue, to keep the pressure up,\" Ansari said. \"That\u2019s why you know some of us are going, and so many members will be going. Because this is about the future of our democracy and the future of due process as American citizens.\u201d",

      "Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday afternoon at the Arizona trial for Lori Vallow Daybell",
      "PHOENIX -- Closing arguments are scheduled Monday afternoon at the Arizona trial for Lori Vallow Daybell, the Idaho woman with doomsday religious beliefs who\u2019s charged with conspiring to murder her estranged husband in suburban Phoenix. Vallow Daybell, who isn\u2019t a lawyer but has chosen to defend herself, told the judge late last week that she plans to rest her case without calling witnesses or putting on evidence. If she follows through on those plans, closing arguments will be held Monday in the Phoenix courtroom where jurors heard testimony from prosecution witnesses for seven days. Prosecutors say she conspired with her brother, Alex Cox, to kill Charles Vallow at her home in Chandler in July 2019 so she could collect money from his life insurance policy and marry her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell, an Idaho author who wrote several religious novels about prophecies and the end of the world.",
      "Cox, who claimed he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Vallow, died five months later from what medical examiners said was a blood clot in his lungs. Cox\u2019s account was later called into question. Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she would face a life sentence without the possibility of release until serving at least 25 years. In opening statements, Vallow Daybell said during the encounter inside the house, Vallow chased her with a bat, and Alex shot Vallow in self-defense after she left the house. She has already been convicted in Idaho of killing her two youngest children and conspiring to murder a romantic rival, for which she was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Last week at the Arizona trial, Adam Cox, another brother of Vallow Daybell, testified on behalf of the prosecution, telling jurors that he had no doubt that Vallow Daybell and his brother Alex were behind Vallow's death.",
      "Adam Cox said Vallow\u2019s killing occurred just before he and Vallow were planning an intervention to bring Vallow Daybell back into the mainstream of their shared faith in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He testified that before Vallow\u2019s death, his sister had told people her husband was no longer living and that a zombie was living inside his body. Four months before he died, Charles Vallow filed for divorce from Vallow Daybell, saying she had become infatuated with near-death experiences and had claimed to have lived numerous lives on other planets. He alleged she threatened to ruin him financially and kill him. He sought a voluntary mental health evaluation of his wife.",
      "The trial over Vallow\u2019s death will mark the first of two criminal trials in Arizona for Vallow Daybell. She\u2019s scheduled to go on trial again in early June on a charge of conspiring to murder Brandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Vallow Daybell\u2019s niece, Melani Pawlowski.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The great-great-grandson of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Gladstone said he was horrified to learn seven years ago that his ancestors were slave owners in Jamaica and Guyana.",
      "And former BBC journalist Laura Trevelyan said she learned after records of Britain\u2019s Slave Compensation Commission were put online in 2013 that one of her ancestors, Sir John Trevelyan, owned sugar cane plantations in Grenada and about 1,000 enslaved people.",
      "They spoke at a meeting at U.N. headquarters in New York this past week where, for the first time, descendants of slave owners and enslaved people in former British colonies in the Caribbean sat at the same table with diplomats and experts from those nations discussing the contentious issue of reparations.",
      "\u201cThis was a historic event,\u201d said Trevelyan, who moderated the meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. Permanent Forum on People of African Descent's weeklong session.",
      "From about the year 1500, millions of West Africans were sent to work mainly on plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas, including the southern United States. U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk told the forum that an estimated 25 million to 30 million Africans were uprooted for the purpose of slavery.",
      "Few nations have apologized for their role in slavery, and reparations have been the subject of much debate.",
      "The Geneva-based Human Rights Council has called for global action for years, including reparations, apologies and educational reforms to make amends for racism against people of African descent. The 15-nation Caribbean Community, known as CARICOM, has a 10-point plan for reparatory justice, starting with demands for European countries where enslaved people were kept and traded to issue formal apologies.",
      "T\u00fcrk noted a European Union statement in 2023 profoundly regretting the \u201cuntold suffering\u201d caused by the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the African Union\u2019s designation of 2025 as the \u201cYear of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations.\u201d",
      "At the meeting of descendants of enslaved people and slave owners on Tuesday, Trevelyan spoke of her family\u2019s decision to apologize to Grenada and to make a contribution of 100,000 British pounds (about $133,000) toward education in the Caribbean island nation.",
      "Going to Grenada with family and apologizing \u201cwasn\u2019t exactly smooth sailing,\u201d said Trevelyan, who left the BBC and has become a campaigner for reparations. There were protests by one group that thought the apology was inadequate and the money not enough.",
      "Also at the meeting was Aidee Walker, who said she was shocked when a DNA test revealed she was not only predominantly Scots-Irish but also part Nigerian, then discovered that her great-great-great-grandfather, who moved to New Zealand, was the son of a slave owner in Jamaica named John Malcolm and an African housekeeper.",
      "Walker and her sister, Kate Thomas, said when they found out they felt they had to do something.",
      "Thomas said she discovered what Trevelyan was doing and got in touch with Verene Shepherd, a professor emeritus and vice chair of the CARICOM reparations commission, who encouraged the sisters to start with the apology.",
      "Charles Gladstone, meanwhile, said he felt \u201ca profound sense of guilt\u201d after learning that former Prime Minister Gladstone\u2019s father owned estates with enslaved people \u2014 and that a great deal of his privileged life \u201cwas essentially connected to this criminal past.\u201d",
      "He said he apologized to Guyana and Jamaica and will try to do something \u201cto make the world a better place.\u201d",
      "While Britain\u2019s role in abolishing slavery in 1833 is widely taught, Gladstone said, its involvement in the trade \u201chas been completely buried.\u201d The history must be told, he said, because \"the evils of this crime against humanity are not historical, they\u2019re felt very, very profoundly today.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador, James Kariuki, attended the meeting but did not speak. The British Mission, asked for a comment, sent a statement from Development Minister Anneliese Dodds to Parliament on Feb. 25 saying she and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been \u201cabsolutely clear that we will not be making cash transfers and payments to the Caribbean.\u201d",
      "Gladstone said supporters of reparations must keep working together. If thousands of families like his stand up and say, \"'We would like to do something about this,' then there is a chance that the government in Britain could do something more substantial,\" he said.",
      "Thomas agreed. \u201cIf we can get the numbers, then that could influence institutions and governments to act,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great start to what I think will be a lifelong journey.\"",
      "Shepherd, who taught at the University of the West Indies, said there have not been many apologies and, while some Europeans express remorse or regret for slavery, \u201cno one is talking about reparations.\u201d",

      "Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion.",
      "But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in the latest mass firing ordered by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter of college.

      "\u201cNot only me, but all these peoples\u2019 lives are turned upside down,\u201d Giagnorio said.",
      "The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency can be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy.",
      "With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.",
      "An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout.",
      "A U.S. Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically Black neighborhood\u2019s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded.",
      "The withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic.",
      "A landlord may have to sell an office building for a loss after his federal tenants were among several that abruptly canceled local leases, adding a glut of real estate to the market.",
      "And the city's Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk\u2019s electric car company out of Missouri.",
      "The nation's health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency's 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families.",
      "\u201cThe poor will become even more poor now,\u201d Giagnorio said. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we\u2019re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?\u201d",
      "Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers.",
      "But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn\u2019t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year.",
      "For now, she can\u2019t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when?",
      "The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful.",
      "The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what\u2019s required of them,\u201d said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.",
      "By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week.",
      "Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies.",
      "Ellis said IRS workers share the public\u2019s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she\u2019s decided to take a \u201croll of the dice\u201d and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer.",
      "\u201cI love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the bully force me out.\u201d",
      "Urban farmer Rosie Warren grew 2,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighborhood, where many Black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century.",
      "Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers\u2019 market serving the area.",
      "Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children.",
      "In February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award \u201cno longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "On a recent morning, Warren took a break from preparing the soil for planting to ponder the USDA\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cWhat do you do if you don\u2019t support providing access to food to people who don\u2019t have it? Wouldn\u2019t this make your job easier?\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",
      "Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising.",
      "At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City.",
      "\u201cIt just means giving families less food,\u201d said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he\u2019s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Health Department\u2019s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.",
      "One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times.",
      "Kansas City\u2019s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.",
      "\u201cThat early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,\u201d she said.",
      "But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration's $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news \u201ccrushed\u201d the department's carefully laid plans, Jones said.",
      "Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents.",
      "\u201cIt would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.\u201d",
      "Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he\u2019s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.",
      "Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month.",
      "Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz of hundreds of lease cancellations that has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.",
      "In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE\u2019s online \u201cWall of Receipts.\u201d",
      "Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market.",
      "But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cBusinesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are going to be unhappy but it\u2019s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.\u201d",
      "With liberal anger growing at Musk\u2019s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts.",
      "State records show Tesla sales there have dropped amid calls for a boycott. Now, enough voter anger could even force the business to close.",
      "Organizers of a newly launched \u201cUnplug Musk\u201d initiative are seeking to use democracy to strike at the world\u2019s richest man by changing state law to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.",
      "They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a soul in this country who\u2019s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people\u2019s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that. And it is going to cause some devastating impacts,\u201d said organizer Brad Ketcher, a prominent Democrat and lawyer who helped draft the state\u2019s 2022 marijuana legalization referendum.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, \u201cHHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "The IRS has offered a similar rationale for its downsizing, saying it is making process improvements that will ultimately more efficiently serve the public.",
      "Musk said last year that Trump\u2019s budget cuts would cause a \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d that would soon put the economy on stronger footing.",
      "One local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship will be in Kansas City, including whether it will just slow growth or cause population losses.",
      "\u201cIt's a big burden that\u2019s being placed on a narrow group of people,\u201d said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a nonprofit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. \u201cIt will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.\"",
      "Trump has credited DOGE with helping end \u201cthe flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d saving billions to help improve the nation\u2019s finances.",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about Kansas City. But Trump said recently he would invite the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House to make up for a 2020 Super Bowl victory celebration that was canceled during the pandemic.",

      "A slow-moving, active storm system brought heavy rain, large hail and tornadoes to parts of Texas and Oklahoma and left three people dead as severe weather warnings Sunday continue to threaten parts of the south-central and Midwest U.S.",
      "On Easter Sunday, communities in Texas and Oklahoma were beginning to assess the damage wreaked by tornadoes. There were 17 reported events Saturday, according to Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Five were confirmed in south-central Oklahoma, including one that inflicted substantial damage on a small town that was still recovering from a March tornado.",
      "The storm also brought heavy rain to a broad swath of north-central Texas across central-eastern Oklahoma, much of which saw 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) accumulate Saturday into Sunday.",
      "Police in Moore, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City, received dozens of reports of \u201chigh-water incidents\u201d over the weekend, including two cars stranded in flood waters Saturday evening. One car was swept away under a bridge, and police said they were able to rescue some people, but a woman and 12-year-old boy were found dead.",
      "\u201cThis was a historical weather event that impacted roads and resulted in dozens of high-water incidents across the city,\u201d Moore police said in a statement Sunday. Moore has about 63,000 residents.",
      "The storm also killed one person about 80 miles (129 kilometers) farther southeast after a tornado touched down in Spaulding, according to the Hughes County Emergency Management. The department wrote on Facebook that several homes and structures were destroyed and there were \u201cnumerous washouts\u201d of county roads.",
      "The National Weather Service said the preliminary survey of damage showed that tornado was at least EF1, with wind speeds between 86 and 110 mph (138 to 177 kph), as was another south of Oklahoma City in Love County.",
      "Oravec said the system wasn't moving much over Texas and Oklahoma Saturday, leaving the area stuck under a very active thunderstorm pattern that produced large hail, flash flooding and tornadoes.",
      "Bill Macon, emergency management director in Oklahoma's Marshall County, said their early assessments show a tornado \u201cskipped and jumped around\u201d over a path of 6 to 7 miles (about 10 to 11 kilometers) in the rural area that left at least 20 homes damaged, with some destroyed completely.",
      "Macon said people were mostly home when the late night tornado came through, downing \u201chuge\u201d trees and dozens of electric poles and power lines, but there had not been reports of injuries or fatalities.",
      "\u201cWe take those things pretty serious down here in Oklahoma,\u201d Macon said of the National Weather Service's warnings.",
      "One Oklahoma town that was still rebuilding from an early March tornado was hit again late Saturday. The north side of Ada, a town home to about 16,000 people, sustained damage that the weather service said indicated at least an EF1 tornado based on a preliminary survey. Social media posts showed roofs ripped off businesses in town, storefront windows blown in and billboards knocked sideways.",
      "In a video posted to Facebook, Jason Keck, Ada director of emergency management, said the tornado seemed to track across the north side of town to a shopping center, \u201cleaving a lot of damage to buildings, power lines and trees.\u201d",
      "One clothing store was \u201cseverely damaged,\u201d according to The Ada News, but \u201cbracketed on both sides by intact structures.\u201d",
      "At least two tornadoes crossed west Parker County, Texas, on Saturday, the county\u2019s emergency services said on Facebook. Emergency crews were dispatched to several houses with roofs torn off and homes exposed, photos showed. One detached roof ended up smashed across a driveway.",
      "Later Sunday, the storm system moved more quickly northeast but remained active with the risk of hail, high winds and heavy rains in Arkansas, Missouri, southern Illinois and southeastern Iowa. Thousands in Missouri were without power.",
      "While heavy rain was subsiding in Texas and Oklahoma by late Sunday afternoon, additional heavy rain is expected across parts of the Plains this week, Oravec said. With streams already swollen and the ground saturated, that leaves the area at risk of additional flooding.",

    "story": [
      "Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster off the Gulf Coast, the effects of the largest oil spill in U.S. history are still being felt",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the Gulf Coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons (507.2 million liters) of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nation's worst offshore oil spill are still being felt.",
      "Oil company BP paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significant compensation.",
      "Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in Louisiana. As the Trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the Gulf Coast are slipping away.",
      "In the coastal community of Lafitte in southeast Louisiana, Tammy Gremillion is celebrating Easter Sunday, the anniversary of the April 20 spill, without her daughter. She remembers warning Jennifer against joining a cleanup crew tasked with containing the spill for BP.",
      "\"But I couldn\u2019t stop her \u2014 they were offering these kids lots of money,\u201d Gremillion said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the dangers. They didn\u2019t do what they should have to protect these young people.\u201d",
      "Jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. She also was exposed to Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has been linked to health problems.",
      "In 2020, Jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can be caused by exposure to oil.",
      "Gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughter's death, is \u201c1,000% confident\u201d that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against BP in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. Gremillion's suit is one of a small number of cases still pending.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed and only one has been settled.",
      "In a 2012 settlement, BP paid ill workers and coastal residents $67 million, but this amounted to no more than $1,300 each for nearly 80% of those seeking compensation.",
      "Attorneys from the Downs Law Group, representing Gremillion and around 100 others in cases against BP, say the company leveraged procedural technicalities to block victims from getting their day in court.",
      "BP declined to comment on pending litigation. In court filings, BP denied allegations that oil exposure caused health problems and attacked the credibility of medical experts brought by plaintiffs.",
      "The environmental impact was devastating, recalled PJ Hahn, who served on the frontlines as a southeast Louisiana coastal management official. He watched the oil eat away at barrier islands and marsh around his community in Plaquemines Parish until \u201cit would just crumble like a cookie in hot coffee, just break apart.\u201d",
      "Oyster beds suffocated, reefs were blanketed in chemicals and the fishing industry tanked. Pelicans diving for dead fish emerged from the contaminated waters smeared in a black sheen. Tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Since then, \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made restoring Gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to The\u200b Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against BP.",
      "The council says more than 300 restoration projects worth $5.38 billion have been approved in the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America. The projects include acquiring wetlands in Mississippi to protect nesting areas for birds, rebuilding reefs along Pensacola Bay in Florida and restoring around 4 square miles (11 square kilometers) of marsh in Lake Borgne near New Orleans.",
      "While a tragedy, the spill \"galvanized a movement \u2014 one that continues to push for a healthier, more resilient coast,\u201d said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a conservation coalition.",
      "The influx of billions of dollars in penalties paid by BP \"allowed us to think bigger, act faster and rely on science to guide large-scale solutions,\u201d she added.",
      "Yet what many conservationists see as the flagship of the restoration projects funded by the Deepwater Horizon disaster payout \u2014 an approximately $3 billion effort to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to rebuild 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) of land in southeast Louisiana \u2014 has stalled over concerns of its impact on the livelihoods of local communities and dolphin populations.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has said the project would \u201cbreak our culture\" by harming local oyster and shrimp fisheries due to the influx of freshwater. Earlier this month, his administration paused the project for 90 days, citing its high costs, and its future remains uncertain.",
      "The Trump administration is seeking to sell more offshore oil and gas leases, which the industry trade group American Petroleum Institute called \u201ca big step forward for American energy dominance.\u201d",

      "Marijuana culture\u2019s high holiday known as 4/20 falls this year on Easter, as well as the last day of Passover",
      "Marijuana culture's high holiday, known as 4/20, falls this year on Easter Sunday, as well as the last day of Passover, meaning cannabis fans can celebrate in some unusual ways, including an \u201cEaster nug hunt\u201d in Los Angeles, kosher-style THC gummies in New York and a \u201cblaze and praise\u201d drag brunch in Portland, Oregon.",
      "\u201cIt seemed appropriate with egg prices today that we'd be searching for something else,\u201d said Brett Davis, who runs the marijuana tour company Weed Bus Los Angeles and organized the \u201cEaster nug hunt.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at 4/20\u2019s history and how it's being celebrated this year:",
      "The origins of the date, and the term \u201c420\u201d generally, were long murky.",
      "Some claimed it referred to a police code for marijuana possession or was derived from Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cRainy Day Women No. 12 & 35,\u201d with its refrain of \u201cEverybody must get stoned,\u201d 420 being the product of 12 times 35.",
      "But the prevailing explanation is that it started in the 1970s with a group of bell-bottomed buddies from San Rafael High School, in California\u2019s Marin County north of San Francisco, who called themselves \u201cthe Waldos.\u201d",
      "A friend\u2019s brother was afraid of getting busted for a patch of cannabis he was growing in the woods at nearby Point Reyes, so he drew a map and gave the teens permission to harvest the crop, the story goes.",
      "During fall 1971, at 4:20 p.m., just after classes and football practice, the group would meet up at the school\u2019s statue of chemist Louis Pasteur, smoke a joint and head out to search for the weed patch. They never did find it, but their private lexicon \u2014 \u201c420 Louie\u201d and later just \u201c420\u201d \u2014 would take on a life of its own.",
      "The Waldos saved postmarked letters and other artifacts from the 1970s referencing \u201c420,\u201d which they now keep in a bank vault, and when the Oxford English Dictionary added the term in 2017, it cited some of those documents as the earliest recorded uses.",
      "A brother of one of the Waldos was a close friend of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh, as Lesh once confirmed in an interview with the Huffington Post, now HuffPost. The Waldos began hanging out in the band\u2019s circle, and the slang term spread.",
      "Fast-forward to the early 1990s: Steve Bloom, a reporter for the cannabis magazine High Times, was at a Dead show when he was handed a flyer urging people to \u201cmeet at 4:20 on 4/20 for 420-ing in Marin County at the Bolinas Ridge sunset spot on Mt. Tamalpais.\u201d High Times published it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon,\u201d one of the Waldos, Steve Capper, now 69, once told The Associated Press. \u201cMost things die within a couple years, but this just goes on and on. It\u2019s not like someday somebody\u2019s going to say, \u2018OK, Cannabis New Year\u2019s is on June 23rd now.\u2019\u201d",
      "While the Waldos came up with the term, the people who made the flier that was distributed at the Dead show \u2014 effectively turning 4/20 into a holiday \u2014 remain unknown.",
      "With weed, naturally.",
      "In New York City, the cannabis brand Tokin' Jew is advertising a kosher-style THC gummy line, \u201cTokin' Chews,\u201d designed to meet dietary restrictions for Passover.",
      "Davis said he expected 300 people to partake in the West Hollywood Easter nug scavenger hunt this weekend, aided by a mobile app leading them through participating dispensaries, trivia challenges and \u201cstoner activities.\u201d There is a $500 cash prize.",
      "In Portland, Bar Carlo is hosting the \u201cblaze and praise\u201d drag brunch. Cannabis consumption isn't allowed onsite \u2014 \"Please blaze before you arrive or go for a walk in the neighborhood in between performances,\" the event listing reads \u2014 but there will be a door-prize gift basket from a local dispensary.",
      "Bar owner Melinda Archuleta said the brunch is a dry run for hosting Pride month events in June. She herself doesn't care much for marijuana, but as a Mexican American who has been influenced by Catholicism, she is interested in seeing the two cultures melded \u201cin a cheeky way.\u201d",
      "\"I'm really looking forward to seeing how the queens do it,\" Archuleta said. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously given them carte blanche to do whatever they want \u2014 it's 21 and up \u2014 so it doesn't matter if it's sacrilegious or borderline offensive.\"",
      "There are bigger celebrations, too, including the Mile High 420 Festival in Denver and one put on by SweetWater Brewing in Atlanta. Hippie Hill in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park historically has attracted massive crowds, but the gathering was canceled for a second straight year, with organizers citing a lack of financial sponsorship and city budget cuts.",
      "Just north of the Bay Area, Lagunitas Brewing in Petaluma, California, releases its \u201cWaldos\u2019 Special Ale\u201d every year on 4/20 in partnership with the term\u2019s coiners.",

    "story": [
      "The Everglades is more than just swamps, fan boats and alligators and restoration efforts impact more than the land between Florida\u2019s east and west coasts",
      "ISLAMORADA, Fla. -- The Everglades is more than just swamps, fan boats and alligators and restoration efforts impact more than the land between Florida's east and west coasts.",
      "Florida Bay, a body of water located between the southern end of mainland Florida and the Florida Keys, makes up about a third of Everglades National Park.",
      "High salt levels during dry periods can have fatal consequences for the plants and animals living in the region, though experts are hopeful an early rain season this year will prevent a massive sea grass die-off like those experienced in the past.",
      "Steve Davis, chief science officer with The Everglades Foundation, called Florida Bay the estuary of the Everglades, which is actually a giant, slow-moving river starting around Orlando and running toward the southern end of the Florida peninsula.",
      "\u201cWhat that meant for Florida Bay was that during wet years, there\u2019s enough water getting into the bay to keep the salinities within that optimal salinity range,\" Davis said. \u201cBut when we run into an average-to-dry year or a drought year, it meant that salinity levels in the bay would get so high that it could be detrimental to the health of the seagrasses and the other species that depend on that habitat.\u201d",
      "Florida Bay doesn\u2019t have particularly strong tides, meaning water can sit in the bay for up to a year. When evaporating seawater isn't replaced by water from the Everglades, bay salinity levels can double normal ocean salinity, Davis explained.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s when we really run into some problems with the health of the habitats down here in the bay,\u201d he said.",
      "The last major sea grass die-off occurred in 2015. Xavier Figueredo, a recreational boat captain with Bay and Reef Company, said he was working in the area when the massive die-off hit about 40,000 acres (16,000 hectares).",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t see the water. All you see is dead grass floating on top,\u201d Figueredo said. \u201cAnd it smells like sulfur, like rotting eggs. As the die-off continued, more of the ecosystem was affected, the fish were affected.\u201d",
      "Even with more than 40% of Florida under drought conditions, Davis said he is not especially worried yet about another sea-grass die-off. Salt levels in the bay are already comparatively lower this year than they were in 2015.",
      "Davis said that is at least partially thanks to a massive project that elevated more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) of the Tamiami Trail, a roadway built in 1928 that runs through the Everglades from Miami to Naples before heading north to Tampa.",
      "The route was essentially a giant dam preventing water from flowing south, but replacing the roadway with two long bridges, completed in 2013 and 2019, unblocked the so-called river of grass.",
      "\u201cMonths of inflow across Tamiami Trail have helped to moderate salinities,\" Davis said.",
      "The other significant advantage Florida Bay has this year compared to 2015 is the forecast of an early wet season rather than a delayed wet season, Davis said.",
      "While elevating Tamiami Trail already has created significant benefit for the Everglades and Florida Bay, scientists are counting on a massive restoration project, the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir, to address decades-old water problems throughout Florida.",
      "The $3.9 billion project will create a reservoir and wetland to store and clean polluted water from Lake Okeechobee in central Florida before it\u2019s discharged into the southern Everglades. This also should decrease the amount of polluted water being sent to Florida\u2019s east and west coasts.",
      "Davis called the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir \u201cthe game changer for freshwater flow restoration.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now are just the benefits of the plumbing, the infrastructure that helps to get all that water into the park,\u201d he said. \"But once we\u2019re able to flow those larger volumes of water south, we\u2019re going to see system-wide improvement all the way down into Florida Bay.\u201d",
      "Everglades restoration is not only tied to Florida's ecological future but its economic future, said Paul Hindsley, the Everglades Foundation chief economist.",
      "\u201cFor every dollar of investment in restoration, we\u2019re receiving $4 in economic benefits,\" Hindsley said.",
      "Economic benefits include adding to the residential and industrial water supply, reducing extreme events from drought such as fires and reducing the risk of flooding from heavy precipitation, Hindsley said.",
      "The Everglades also provide over $5 billion a year in reduced risk for costs associated with National Flood Insurance Program claims. Meanwhile, South Florida\u2019s mangroves and reefs play an important role in reducing the impacts of storm surge.",
      "\u201cProtecting the environment is protecting the wealth of Floridians,\" Hindsley said.",

      "Nearly six years after a man fatally shot 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanic shoppers at a Walmart in Texas near the U.S.-Mexico border, the gunman's criminal case is set to come to a close",
      "DALLAS -- The long-running criminal case against a Texas gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanic shoppers at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019 is on the verge of coming to a close.",
      "Patrick Crusius, 26, is expected to plead guilty Monday to capital murder and receive a sentence of life in prison with no possibility of parole for the massacre near the U.S.-Mexico border. El Paso County District Attorney James Montoya said last month he was offering Crusius a plea deal and that he wouldn't face the death penalty on the state charge.",
      "Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in federal court after pleading guilty in 2023 to hate crime and weapons charges. Under the Biden administration, federal prosecutors also took the death penalty off the table.",
      "Crusius is expected to serve his time in a state prison. Crusius initially was arrested by local authorities and will enter the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice if he is sentenced on the state charges, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly attack on Aug. 3, 2019, and its aftermath:",
      "Crusius was 21 years old when authorities say he drove for more than 10 hours from his home in suburban Dallas to El Paso and opened fire at the Walmart, which is popular with shoppers from Mexico and the U.S.",
      "Prosecutors have said Crusius was wearing earmuffs that muted the sound of gunfire when he began shooting people in the parking lot.",
      "He then moved inside the store and continued firing an AK-style rifle, cornering shoppers at a bank near the entrance where nine were killed before shooting at the checkout area and people in aisles.",
      "Exiting Walmart, he fired on a passing car, killing an elderly man and wounding his wife.",
      "Crusius was apprehended shortly after and confessed to officers who stopped him at an intersection, according to police.",
      "In a posting to an online message board just before the massacre, Crusius, a white, community-college dropout, said the shooting was \u201cin response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d He said Hispanics were going to take over the government and economy.",
      "On social media, he appeared consumed by the nation\u2019s immigration debate, tweeting #BuildtheWall and posts praising the hard-line border policies of Republican President Donald Trump, who was in his first term at the time.",
      "After the shooting, Crusius told officers that he had targeted Mexicans.",
      "Joe Spencer, one of Crusius\u2019 attorneys, on Thursday described Crusius as \u201can individual with a broken brain.\u201d Spencer said Crusius has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which can be marked by hallucinations, delusions and mood swings.",
      "The people who were killed ranged in age from a 15-year-old high school athlete to grandparents. They included immigrants and Mexican nationals who had crossed the U.S. border on routine shopping trips.",
      "They included Jordan Anchondo and Andre Anchondo, who were killed while shopping with their 2-month-old child, Paul, who survived. Authorities have said Jordan Anchondo shielded the baby from gunfire while her husband shielded them both.",
      "Guillermo \u201cMemo\u201d Garcia and his wife Jessica Coca Garcia were fundraising for their daughter's soccer team in the parking lot when they were both shot. She suffered leg wounds but recovered. He died from his injuries nearly nine months after the shooting, raising the death toll to 23.",
      "A week after the shooting, Coca Garcia rose from her wheelchair to give a speech across the road from the county jail where Crusius was being held.",
      "\u201cRacism is something I always wanted to think didn\u2019t exist,\" she said. \"Obviously, it does.\u201d",
      "Montoya said he decided to offer the plea deal because a majority of victims' relatives were eager for the case to be resolved. He acknowledged not all the families agreed.",
      "Montoya, a Democrat, said he supports the death penalty and believes Crusius deserves it, but the case might not have gone to trial until 2028 if his office had continued seeking the death penalty.",
      "When Montoya took office in January, he became the fourth district attorney to oversee the case in nearly six years. One of his predecessors resigned in 2022 under pressure over her handling of the case. He said the pandemic also caused delays.",
      "Stephanie Melendez, whose father, David Johnson, died shielding his wife and granddaughter, said she initially wanted Crusius to get the death penalty but as the case dragged on she wanted it to end.",
      "\u201cI just wanted it to be over,\" Melendez said. \"I was done reliving everything. I was done going to court for hours. I was done with the briefings that happened after that would last hours and it was just the same talk over and over again. We were just ready to be done with it all because, honestly, it\u2019s like reliving the trauma over and over again.\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- Current and former Seattle police officers who attended President Donald Trump's \u201cStop the Steal\u201d political rally on Jan. 6, 2021 at the U.S. Capitol are asking the nation's highest court to keep their identities anonymous in public court records.",
      "Using \u201cJohn Doe\u201d pseudonyms, they sued over whether the investigation into their activities should be made public. The Washington State Supreme Court ruled in February that they can be identified and that they haven't shown that public release of their names violates their right to privacy. The state supreme court denied reconsideration earlier this month and lawyers for the four officers submitted a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking that the names remain protected during their legal challenge.",
      "Four officers who attended events in the nation\u2019s capital on the day of an insurrection claimed they are protected under the state\u2019s public records law. They say they did nothing wrong and that revealing their names would violate their privacy.",
      "In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 events, the Seattle Police Department ordered an investigation into whether any of its officers who traveled to Washington, D.C. to attend the rally had violated any laws or department policies.",
      "The investigation found that married officers Caitlin and Alexander Everett crossed barriers set up by the Capitol police and were next to the Capitol Building, in violation of the law, prompting Diaz to fire the pair. Investigators said three other officers had not violated policies and the fourth case was ruled \u201cinconclusive.\u201d",
      "Sam Sueoka, a law student at the time, filed records requests seeking disclosure of the investigation's records for the participating officers.",
      "\u201cWe are reviewing the Does' motion for a stay,\u201d Neil Fox, one of the Sueoka's attorneys, said in an email to The Associated Press Saturday.",
      "Requiring the officers to use their real names in the litigation would create a chilling effect on voicing unpopular opinions, the petition to the Supreme Court said.",
      "\u201cAt its core, this appeal involves whether a government agency can ignore the chilling effect resulting from an employer requiring an employee to disclose their off-duty political activities and attendant impressions or motivations associated therewith, followed by widespread dissemination to those who deliberately seek this information to subject these public servants to vilification without the commission of any misconduct whatsoever,\u201d the petition said.",
      "A response to the petition is due next week on Friday.",

      "NEW YORK -- Opponents of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration took to the streets of communities large and small across the U.S. on Saturday, decrying what they see as threats to the nation\u2019s democratic ideals.",
      "The disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration marking the start of the American Revolutionary War 250 years ago. In San Francisco, protesters formed a human banner reading \u201cImpeach & Remove\u201d on the sands of Ocean Beach overlooking the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Thomas Bassford was among those who joined demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside of Boston. \u201cThe shot heard \u2019round the world\u201d on April 19, 1775, heralded the start of the nation\u2019s war for independence from Britain.",
      "The 80-year-old retired mason from Maine said he believed Americans today are under attack from their own government and need to stand up against it.",
      "\u201cThis is a very perilous time in America for liberty,\" Bassford said, as he attended the event with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. \"I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.\u201d",
      "Elsewhere, protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government. Others organized more community-service events, such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters.",
      "The protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide protests against the Trump administration drew thousands to the streets across the country.",
      "Organizers say they\u2019re protesting what they call Trump\u2019s civil rights violations and constitutional violations, including efforts to deport scores of immigrants and to scale back the federal government by firing thousands of government workers and effectively shutter entire agencies.",
      "Some of the events drew on the spirit of the American Revolutionary War, calling for \u201cno kings\u201d and resistance to tyranny.",
      "Boston resident George Bryant, who was among those protesting in Concord, Massachusetts, said he was concerned Trump was creating a \u201cpolice state\u201d in America as he held up a sign saying, \u201cTrump fascist regime must go now!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s defying the courts. He\u2019s kidnapping students. He\u2019s eviscerating the checks and balances,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThis is fascism.\u201d",
      "In Washington, Bob Fasick said he came out to the rally by the White House out of concern about threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, as well as Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.",
      "The Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shutter Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programs and scale back protections for transgender people.",
      "\u201cI cannot sit still knowing that if I don\u2019t do anything and everybody doesn\u2019t do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbors is simply not one that I would want to live,\u201d said the 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia.",
      "In Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse. They held signs that said \u201cFight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight\u201d and \u201cSave SSA,\u201d in reference to the Social Security Administration.",
      "And in Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants as they marched from the New York Public Library north towards Central Park past Trump Tower.",
      "\u201cNo fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,\u201d they chanted to the steady beat of drums, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Marshall Green, who was among the protesters, said he was most concerned that Trump has invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCongress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,\u201d said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey. \u201cYou cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ten years ago Saturday, Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries sustained during transport in a Baltimore police van and the city was thrust into a national debate over police brutality against Black Americans",
      "BALTIMORE -- It was almost instinctual for Ray Kelly to jump into action when he heard about a group of high school students clashing with police. He wanted to help protect the kids and de-escalate things, but instead, he watched his neighborhood burn.",
      "Unrest broke out after Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries sustained during transport in a police van in April 2015. The protesters stormed through majority-Black west Baltimore, setting police cars ablaze and looting businesses. They were fighting the generations of oppression experienced by Black Americans, from racist housing policies and crumbling schools to limited job opportunities, rampant gun violence and poor living conditions.",
      "A community activist from Gray\u2019s neighborhood, Kelly had focused on police accountability for years. As federal investigators launched a probe into the Baltimore Police Department and local prosecutors charged the officers involved, he doubled down in calling for stronger oversight at a time of growing national outrage over police brutality.",
      "Ten years later, his ongoing efforts illustrate Baltimore\u2019s progress \u2014 and lack thereof.",
      "Among the positive changes, Kelly said, there are more mechanisms to address police misconduct and hold officers accountable. Homicides and shootings are trending downward after a prolonged surge that began in the wake of Gray\u2019s death. And while west Baltimore still faces widespread poverty and neglect, he said, at least elected officials are paying more attention.",
      "\u201cPeople have to hear us out, because there is now this possibility that we can organize and elevate our voices,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI think Freddie Gray\u2019s death put that in motion.\u201d",
      "But progress is often painfully slow and woefully insufficient. Meanwhile city leaders face new obstacles from the Trump administration\u2019s escalating attacks on civil rights and diversity initiatives.",
      "For Gray\u2019s family, a decade has passed since their private loss played out on national news.",
      "Joined by the mayor and other dignitaries Saturday morning, his twin sister Fredricka laid a wreath of flowers near the site of his arrest, marking the anniversary of when he died in the hospital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still justice for Freddie Gray,\u201d she said, repeating what became a rallying cry in 2015. \u201cTen years now.\u201d",
      "Baltimore has a long history of mistreating its Black residents. In 1910, city leaders enacted the country\u2019s first residential segregation ordinance restricting African American homeowners to certain blocks.",
      "Kelly grew up during the height of the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and the national war on drugs, when police routinely conducted \u201cstreet sweeps\u201d or mass arrests in west Baltimore. When he started selling drugs to support himself during high school, the police were just another obstacle in an already uphill battle. He later struggled with addiction and served time in prison.",
      "After coming home in the early 2000s, Kelly started working with a neighborhood advocacy group to improve public safety. That put him in a unique position when the U.S. Department of Justice launched its probe of city police: Knowing residents would be wary about cooperating with federal investigators, Kelly helped make introductions and encouraged people to participate.",
      "\u201cIt was a gamble,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really what this community does.\u201d",
      "But the gamble paid off. The investigation uncovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing practices, especially against Black people.",
      "The findings resulted in a 2017 consent decree mandating a series of reforms for the department, which promised to overhaul its policies and training.",
      "Since then, progress is inching along.",
      "The agency celebrated a milestone this week when a federal judge terminated two of the consent decree\u2019s 17 sections after finding full and sustained compliance \u2014 including with rules for transporting people in police vans. Gray was handcuffed, shackled and transported without a seatbelt as officers repeatedly ignored his calls for medical attention.",
      "Department leaders say large-scale change is happening, though not overnight. Officers have increased foot patrols, decreased low-level arrests and even undergone training on emotional regulation. They\u2019re less likely to use force when taking people into custody, and they\u2019ve contributed to historic reductions in homicides by partnering with service providers to address the root causes of gun violence.",
      "Police Commissioner Richard Worley said that over the course of his career, he\u2019s watched the culture of policing shift from \u201cwarriors to guardians.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, many Baltimore residents still don\u2019t trust the police to act with compassion and integrity. They don\u2019t believe the department has undergone a significant cultural change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take years and years to redefine the police department in the eyes of the community,\u201d U.S. District Judge James Bredar said during Thursday\u2019s consent decree hearing. \u201cThis work is critical, even if it doesn\u2019t bear fruit immediately.\u201d",
      "Gray, 25, was arrested near his home in west Baltimore\u2019s Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, a once-thriving community that had fallen into disrepair.",
      "In its heyday, nearby Pennsylvania Avenue was a Black entertainment district with renowned jazz clubs, upscale shops and vibrant nightlife. Its cultural artifacts include the childhood home of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the Supreme Court, and a bronze statue of jazz legend Billie Holiday, who also had roots in west Baltimore.",
      "A confluence of factors contributed to its decline, including urban flight and chronic disinvestment. Some businesses left after unrest following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "Open-air drug markets moved in, and over-policing became a common complaint from residents. So when Gray was violently taken into custody after making eye contact with officers and running away, that longstanding frustration boiled over. Officials responded to the 2015 protests by bringing in the Maryland National Guard and imposing a citywide curfew.",
      "Many residents celebrated when prosecutors later announced criminal charges against the six officers involved, but none were convicted.",
      "In the meantime, political leaders visited Sandtown and pledged to invest in housing, youth programs and more. Those big promises have largely failed to materialize.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still the same damn place with the same damn issues,\u201d Kelly said, gazing down the street outside the former church rectory that houses his advocacy organization, the Citizens Policing Project. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of talk, but this is what we see.\u201d",
      "When the city closed the neighborhood\u2019s recreation center in 2021, Sandtown youth were basically left with nowhere to go, said 17-year-old Ryeheen Watson, whose childhood unfolded in the shadow of Gray\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cIt was like, nothing good comes for our community,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re starting as an underdog, there\u2019s nowhere to go but up.\u201d",
      "The second Trump administration will likely create even more challenges for communities like Sandtown as the White House slashes federal initiatives aimed at advancing racial equity.",
      "Baltimore attorney Billy Murphy, who represented the Gray family, said that while Black people continue fighting for their collective future, a resurgence of white supremacism is infecting national politics.",
      "\u201cWhere are we today? That\u2019s where we are,\u201d Murphy said at a recent event commemorating Gray\u2019s death. \u201cWe are heading backwards.\u201d",
      "But at least on the local level, political discourse now includes more progressive Black voices, said Dayvon Love, director of public policy for the grassroots think tank Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle. In his view, Gray\u2019s death was a turning point.",
      "\u201cThat has advanced our ability to advocate unapologetically for Black people in ways that before the uprising were shut out,\u201d Love said.",
      "Mayor Brandon Scott says his administration is achieving long-awaited progress by investing in historically neglected neighborhoods, including a $15 million plan to renovate Sandtown\u2019s recreation center and upgrades to Gilmor Homes, the public housing complex where Gray was arrested.",
      "However, Scott said in an interview, \u201cWe\u2019re not celebrating here, because the work is not complete.\u201d",
      "For Kelly, discussions of politics and progress often miss the point by failing to acknowledge Gray himself, the young man from west Baltimore who died after a tragic encounter with police a decade ago.",
      "Instead of marking the anniversary of his death, Kelly suggested, perhaps it\u2019s his birthday that should be celebrated: Aug. 16, 1989.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Campus mentors. Move-in events. Scholarships. Diversity offices that made them feel welcome on predominantly white campuses.",
      "As U.S. colleges pull back on diversity, equity and inclusion practices, students of color say they are starting to lose all of these things and more.",
      "The full scope of campus DEI rollbacks is still emerging as colleges respond to the Trump administration\u2019s orders against diversity practices. But students at some schools said early cuts are chipping away at the sense of community that helped open the door to higher education.",
      "\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re going back. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it,\u201d said Breeana-Iris Rosario, a junior at the University of Michigan, which is closing its DEI office and scrapping a campus-wide inclusion plan. \u201cIt\u2019s like our voices aren\u2019t being heard.\u201d",
      "The retreat from DEI has been building for years, driven by Republican-led states that have ordered public colleges to close DEI offices and eliminate programs. But it has accelerated under President Donald Trump and his threats to cut federal funding.",
      "Trump's administration escalated the battle when it suggested in a letter to Harvard University that the school should lose its nonprofit status for defying federal orders, including a demand to eliminate DEI \u201cto the satisfaction of the federal government.\u201d",
      "At Michigan, students have been told the casualties include orientation events for new Latino, Arab and Asian American students, along with the LEAD Scholars program, a financial aid award for Black, Latino and Native American students.",
      "Coming from a low-income part of Detroit, Rosario said winning the scholarship cemented her decision to attend Michigan. She later met some of her best friends at a move-in event for Latino students called Alma. Losing those programs, she fears, could reinforce a sense of isolation among Hispanic students, who make up 6% of the school's undergraduates.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard to find my community if I didn\u2019t have access to these resources,\" she said.",
      "A February memo from the Education Department directed schools and colleges to eliminate race from any decision-making around hiring, admissions, housing, financial aid and student life. It warned violators could lose access to federal money.",
      "Dozens of universities have since come under investigation, all while the Trump administration freezes billions of dollars at Harvard and other colleges accused of defying orders on campus antisemitism and transgender athletes.",
      "Michigan was among the first to make major DEI rollbacks, and others have followed to avoid federal scrutiny. Others have rebranded DEI offices and scrubbed the term from websites, and others still are standing firm in support of DEI.",
      "At Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, officials cited the federal orders when they moved to close the campus DEI office last month.",
      "\u201cIt is clear we must be in compliance with them to receive the federal funding that is critical to our present and future,\u201d said Eric Kaler, Case\u2019s president, in a campus message.",
      "Kaler said the office will be replaced by an Office for Campus Enrichment and Engagement, though it\u2019s unclear what that will entail. The private university receives about $250 million a year in federal research funding, 16% of its total revenue, according to university data.",
      "Justen Pippens said the DEI office was like a second home on campus. The junior called it a \u201cstress-free zone\u201d where he could get personal and academic guidance. He grew so close with one staff member that he came to know her as Auntie. He said it\u2019s unclear whether those employees will have jobs at the new office.",
      "Case also is halting its Envision Weekend, an orientation event for underrepresented students. Pippens said it\u2019s a setback for him and other Black students, who make up just 6% of undergraduates at Case.",
      "\u201cNow,\" he said, \u201cwe no longer have our central support systems on campus.\u201d",

      "\u201cDEI is done at the University of Virginia,\u201d Youngkin said in a statement, calling it a shift toward \u201cmerit-based opportunity.\u201d",
      "Tyler English, a senior at UVA, said students have been told scholarships and graduate programs focused on minority students are being scaled back or eliminated. Among other changes, a student group called Men of Color, Honor and Ambition is replacing the word \u201ccolor\u201d with \u201ccharacter,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor a portion of us, we now question whether our identities and voices are truly valued in this space,\u201d said English, a member of the campus\u2019 Black Student Alliance.",
      "University spokesperson Brian Coy wouldn't provide details on DEI rollbacks and said he couldn't confirm changes to scholarships.",
      "The government\u2019s anti-DEI campaign is being challenged in court by opponents who say it offers little clarity on exactly which practices are outlawed, leaving schools to weed out anything that could be construed as DEI.",
      "As a result of the vague directives, \"those who are advocating against this work are getting a higher return on their investment than they should,\u201d said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.",
      "Yet opponents are pressing the White House to go further. Christopher Rufo, a conservative strategist who has fought DEI, said the government should root out DEI using tools that forced desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement.",
      "\u201cDEI is a violation of the Civil Rights Act,\u201d Rufo said on X. \u201cAny publicly funded institution that continues to practice DEI should face a federal investigation, consent decree, termination of funds, and loss of nonprofit status. If that doesn\u2019t work, send in the 101st Airborne.\u201d",
      "In Michigan, the rollbacks are targeting programs that aimed to preserve racial diversity after the state banned affirmative action in 2006, including the LEAD program.",
      "University of Michigan officials declined to discuss changes, but a campus message from President Santa Ono said the school will find other ways to support students, including an expansion of scholarships for low-income students.",

      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",
      "Stamp duty changes 'will motivate first-time buyers'",

      "What next for Bitcoin after bursting $100k barrier?",
      "While the cryptocurrency market is dominated by Bitcoin, there is a plethora of other digital currencies, including USDC - which Tzoni had already amassed in a separate crypto account.",
      "His frustrations began in February when he decided to transfer some of his USDC coins to his Revolut account.",
      "As a precaution - which Revolut suggests doing - he first sent 10 of the coins, worth $10. It was a success and the funds were credited to his Revolut account.",
      "Days later he tried to make a larger transfer of what he thought was 1,500 USDC. The transfer was completed but, this time, the funds were not credited to his account.",
      "Tzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.",
      "When you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through - like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.",
      "Revolut's deposit instructions say to transfer USDC to it, you have to use a network called Polygon. In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called \"Polygon PoS\".",
      "In the second deposit, when he tried to transfer 1,500 USDC, he selected a different network - \"Polygon (bridged)\".",
      "He thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e - a different cryptocurrency.",
      "This is what Revolut received. The company does not handle USDC.e coins.",
      "After seeing his Revolut account had not been credited with the 1,500 coins, Tzoni contacted the Revolut support team.",

      "When approached by BBC News about this case, Revolut gave a different answer.",
      "The firm said the problem was not because Tzoni had used the wrong Polygon network - which he claimed turned his coins into USDC.e.",
      "The deposit failure was \"not because the network itself had 'converted' the token\", it said, without explaining why its support team had suggested to Tzoni that it was.",
      "Revolut told us the deposit ultimately failed because the USDC.e coins it received were not supported by the company's technology.",
      "It said: \"As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.\"",
      "It means the 1,500 USDC.e coins have not been credited to Tzoni's account or sent back to him.",
      "'They are waiting for me to give up'",
      "To Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.",
      "Revolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank.",
      "When using a High Street bank, a mistaken transfer of traditional currency would usually be resolved with the money being reverted back to the customer.",
      "This was established in 2014 in a voluntary code of practice that most UK banks signed up to. There is no such equivalent in the cryptocurrency industry.",
      "After contacting Revolut several times in recent weeks, Tzoni has been told the coins are effectively lost.",
      "\"They are waiting for me to get bored and give up, to accept the money is gone. But I won't,\" Tzoni said, pointing out the coins are in the Revolut system. \"It is ridiculous that they can behave like this.\"",
      "While Tzoni's loss of cryptocurrency is significant to him, the sum is tiny compared with the size of the industry, which has risen sharply in value over the past 18 months.",
      "The global market peaked in value at $3.9tn last December, following the re-election of Donald Trump. Since then it has fallen by $1.1tn, according to tracking website CoinGecko.",
      "Government policies in the US and other countries are also changing to favour the cryptocurrency industry, even though it has suffered several scandals.",
      "FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, went bankrupt in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried, its chief executive, was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year for defrauding customers of billions of dollars.",

      "John Ray III, a lawyer tasked with recovering funds from FTX for defrauded customers, told a bankruptcy court: \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\"",
      "He later told a congressional hearing: \"Nothing against QuickBooks. It's a very nice tool, just not for a multibillion-dollar company.\"",
      "'More regulation is needed'",
      "A couple of months ago Bybit, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange by some estimates, was tricked out of $1.5bn worth of coins by hackers thought to be working for North Korea.",

      "Following the theft, Bybit's chief executive said they \"should have upgraded and moved away from Safe\" earlier.",
      "One of the problems with cryptocurrency firms, says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime, is they can grow very quickly, which means they don't always keep up with the accounting and security challenges of managing so much money.",
      "\"For me it illustrates that if we are going to be serious about cryptocurrencies in the future\u2026 there needs to be some kind of regulation.\"",
      "In Tzoni's case, it might have been easier for him to get his cryptocurrency back or be compensated if there were laws stating what firms need to do if they are sent a coin they don't handle.",

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 08:14:54 GMT",
    "summary": "What is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected.",
    "story": [
      "Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.",
      "But investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.",
      "Governments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.",
      "Recently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.",
      "The volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.",
      "You may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.",
      "What is a government bond?",
      "When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as \"Treasuries\" in the US -  to investors on financial markets.",
      "Such payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond \"matures\" - in other words, expires.",
      "Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.",
      "What is happening with US bonds?",
      "Investors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.",
      "So when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds.",
      "But recently that hasn't happened.",
      "Initially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds.",
      "However, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.",
      "The so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.",
      "Why the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them.",
      "The higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "But it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "Mr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.",
      "Why does Trump care?",
      "Following the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.",
      "Following the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.",
      "It proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "According to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump.",
      "Is this similar to Liz Truss's mini-Budget?",
      "The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.",
      "While bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.",
      "\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.",
      "How is China being linked to US bonds?",
      "Since 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.",
      "Japan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally.",
      "Questions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.",
      "However, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.",

    "summary": "China sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it. Can they break up?",
    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:36:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The temporary measure by the government is aimed at stopping the spread of foot and mouth disease.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has temporarily banned people from bringing cheese and some meats from the European Union (EU) into the country to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease.",
      "But what does that actually mean in practice - and should you be concerned?",
      "What has been banned?",
      "Pork, beef, lamb, mutton, goat, venison and any other products made from these meats - such as sausages - from the EU have been banned. It also applies to pet food.",
      "In addition, milk and dairy products - like butter, cheese and yoghurt - from the EU have also been prohibited.",
      "It covers items such as sandwiches and cured meats as well as raw meats and milk \"regardless of whether it is packed or packaged or whether it has been bought at duty free\".",
      "However, there are exceptions such as chicken, duck, goose and any other products made from these.",
      "Who does the ban apply to?",
      "The measure is only directed at people arriving in Great Britain - as in, England, Wales or Scotland - from the EU.",
      "It does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own measures in place to contain foot and mouth disease.",
      "The ban covers anyone travelling by any mode of transport - whether that's by plane, train, bus or by car.",
      "But it will not be imposed on those arriving to Great Britain from Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man.",
      "Are commercially imported cheeses and meats banned too?",
      "The ban only applies to travellers bringing in items personally - not commercial importers such as farmers or shops.",
      "The reason, according to the UK government, is that commercial meat and cheese imports face higher standards than individuals are subjected to.",
      "They must go through heat treatment, which is meant to kill germs, and come with health certificates signed by vets.",
      "How can animals get foot and mouth disease from meat and dairy products?",
      "The disease typically spreads between animals through direct contact. But they can also catch it by eating contaminated meat or dairy products.",
      "Any products of animal origin, like meat and dairy, could be contaminated with foot and mouth disease.",
      "Even if they are for human consumption, if they are thrown away in a way that could come into contact with foraging wildlife or domestic livestock, that presents a risk.",
      "Should I be worried?",
      "Foot and mouth disease is harmless to humans and there are no cases in the UK -  but it is highly contagious for animals.",
      "It affects cattle, sheep, pigs and, according to the government, \"other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boar, deer, llamas and alpacas\".",
      "Animals that catch it typically come down with a high temperature before developing blisters, usually around the mouth or feet. It can make animals lame and, for the very young, result in fatalities.",
      "How long will the ban last?",
      "The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs introduced the measure on Saturday, 12 April and did not give an end date.",
      "The BBC understands the ban will stay in place until the government believes there is no significant risk from travellers bringing banned meat and dairy into Great Britain.",
      "Why didn't I know about this?",
      "The government put out a release last Friday ahead of the ban coming into force on Saturday.",
      "It told border control and airlines to make passengers aware of the rules and has rolled out a digital and social media campaign.",
      "Eurostar has also been sending out emails to passengers letting them know about the UK rules.",
      "However, many people who have travelled from the EU to Great Britain since the weekend told the BBC they were unaware of the measure and were not told - with no signs in the airport and no checks carried out.",
      "Anyone travelling should follow the rules.",
      "The government says items could be seized and destroyed at the border and, in serious cases, offenders could be fined up to \u00a35,000 in England.",
      "Can I take meat and milk products from the UK into the EU?",
      "No, travellers are not normally allowed to bring meat and milk products into the EU from the UK for personal use.",
      "This has nothing to do with the latest announcement though - it has been the case since Brexit, with the UK facing the same rules as every other non-EU country.",
      "But there is an exemption for powdered baby milk, baby food, or special foods for humans or animals where there is a medical need.",

      "Ms Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard.",

      "A court then decided Ms Balan's case should be subject to arbitration per a contract she signed while working for Tesla.",

      "Shares in Nvidia plunged on Wednesday after the computer chip giant said it would be hit by $5.5bn (\u00a34.2bn) in costs due to the US government tightening its export rules to China.",
      "The firm, which has been at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, will require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China, which has been one of its most popular.",

      "But the fall may only be temporary as analysts say it's expected to spike from April as rising bills and higher business costs take hold.",
      "\"The only significant offset came from the price of clothes which rose strongly this month,\" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",
      "The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years.",
      "Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.",

      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "In May, the inflation figure for April will likely be pushed to around 3% due to increases in gas prices, electricity prices, and water charges, said Michael Saunders, senior advisor at Oxford Economics.",
      "The former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee told Radio 4's Today Programme the effect of Trump's trade wars will also be felt in exports and investment in the UK.",
      "\"We may get a diversion of cheap exports which might have otherwise gone to the US, will start to come to Europe and the UK,\" he said.",
      "\"Perhaps not as high as the Bank of England had feared a few months ago, but the economy will be weaker, with exports and investment and consumer spending all hit and unemployment starting to rise\".",
      "He added that another side-effect of Trump's trade war is hitting global growth, which causes oil prices to fall, which will feed through to lower petrol prices here in the UK.",
      "'It's getting higher and higher'",
      "Sonja Skelton says the biggest cost for her business is staffing - and that's about to get higher with minimum wage increases.",
      "The recent increase in National Insurance has cost her over \u00a360,000.",

      "On top of that, she says that working in engineering, \"you always have ups and downs, because it really depends what's happening all over the world, and conflicts can have a knock-on effect on what we do\".",
      "Interest rate cut",
      "As inflation comes down, it could put pressure on the Bank of England to cut its key interest rate, currently 4.5%.",
      "Vacancies at their lowest point in four years and economic pressure predicted from Donald Trump's tariffs may also encourage the Bank to cut when it meets next month.",
      "But the Bank faces a dilemma, as wage growth remains strong and this would normally discourage a cut in rates.",
      "Experts and analysts predict inflation to fall to near its 2% target by 2026.",

      "Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.",
      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

      "When wedding dress designer Catherine Deane saw her company's Instagram account get hacked, she says it was \"devastating\".",
      "\"It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.",
      "\"To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work\u2026 it was just pulled.\"",
      "Ms Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.",
      "On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.",
      "This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.",
      "So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.",
      "What added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.",
      "Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.",
      "\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"",
      "Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.",
      "In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.",
      "\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.",
      "According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"",
      "His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"",
      "The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.",
      "However, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.",
      "\"We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.\"",
      "Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.",
      "The final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.",
      "He got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.",
      "Because his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (\u00a3900) to unlock the account.",
      "Unable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.",
      "Thankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.",
      "Mr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.",
      "\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.",
      "In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.",
      "He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.",
      "\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.",
      "\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"",
      "He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.",
      "\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.",
      "\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"",
      "The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.",
      "One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.",
      "Meanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts.",
      "Last autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. \"It had just disappeared,\" he says.",
      "\"There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost.\"",
      "The page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU.",

      "Six months later, and the page remains locked.",
      "Meta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1drqeev36qo",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:15:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",
    "story": [
      "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.",
      "But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.",
      "China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.",
      "The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.",
      "This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",
      "US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.",
      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",
      "\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"",
      "China's precious metals the US can't do without",
      "What are 'rare earths' used for?",
      "Can't the US produce its own rare earths?",
      "The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.",
      "There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.",
      "But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.",
      "This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.",
      "Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.",
      "Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\""

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:31:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",
      "Stamp duty changes 'will motivate first-time buyers'",
      "'Buying a first home is harder when you're single'",
      "When will interest rates go down again?"

      "Last week, Tesco admitted that it could take a significant hit if it is forced to cut prices after Asda - now under the leadership of industry veteran Allan Leighton - announced it would reduce grocery costs to boost the struggling store.",
      "A race to lower prices could help households who are still struggling with the cost of living at a time when bills, such as energy and water, are increasing.",
      "\"We're in the strongest position we've ever been [on price competition] and we intend to stay there,\" said Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts.",
      "The company expects the impact of lowering prices to be relatively small compared to a potential \u00a3400m hit announced by Tesco.",
      "Sainsbury's predicts underlying retail profit will tick down by around \u00a336m over the year.",
      "This, said Bernstein analyst William Woods, gives the supermarket \"wiggle room\" to fight with Tesco and Asda if needed.",
      "While supermarkets are always competing with each other over price, the threat of a more intensive clash arose in March when Mr Leighton said Asda would take a hit to its profits in order to reduce prices, rebuild market share and win back customers.",
      "At the time, the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's saw their share prices plunge on speculation they would be forced to fund millions of pounds worth in price cuts to compete with Asda.",
      "Mr Leighton was Asda's chief executive between 1996 and 2001 and returned last year as executive chairman to turn the business around after a period of falling sales and under-investment.",
      "What you can do about the seven bills going up in April",
      "Tesco braces for grocery price war with rivals",
      "Sainsbury's set out its expectations as it revealed that full-year sales rose by 3.1% to \u00a331.5bn. Pre-tax profit jumped from \u00a3277m to \u00a3384m.",
      "Mr Roberts declined to comment on what effect US President Donald Trump's tariffs could have on the business, which also owns Argos and the Habitat brand.",
      "There has been speculation that China, faced with high tariffs on selling goods to the US, might re-route products to other countries and sell them cheaply to offload them.",
      "Mr Roberts said that Sainsbury's was \"watching developments carefully\".",
      "While revenue at Sainsbury's grew strongly over the 12 months to 1 March, sales continued to fall at Argos although it said that the situation improved as it boosted traffic to the brand's website.",
      "The supermarket also reported an 8.9% drop in fuel sales to \u00a34.7bn. It blamed \"reduced demand\" as well as the lower cost of petrol and diesel due to \"falling commodity prices in a highly competitive market\".",
      "Official data released on Wednesday showed that the falling cost of motor fuel helped drive down the overall rate of inflation.",
      "Inflation eased by more than expected to 2.6% in the year to March, from 2.8% in February."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34v4xdylzo",
    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:22:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Economic uncertainty globally and in the UK means there are conflicting forces at play with prices.",
    "story": [
      "The rate of rising prices - inflation - has eased for the second month in a row, official figures show.",
      "In March, prices rose at an annual rate of 2.6%, far slower than the 11% inflation peak seen in 2022.",
      "Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.",
      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Vanessa read this article",
      "\"We have the one of the most expensive systems in the world\u2026 today I want to reform our childcare system\". These words, spoken by the then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt in the 2023 Spring Budget, were a beacon of hope for thousands of parents paying an average of almost \u00a315,000 a year to nurseries and childminders.",
      "The promise was to \"transform the lives of thousands of women\" and \"build a childcare system comparable to the best\".",
      "Two years on, the rollout of what's commonly known as the \"free hours\" scheme in England is almost complete. From September, eligible working parents will be able to access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time (for 38 weeks), paid for by the government, for their children from the age of nine months to four.",
      "Only it hasn't been the panacea that many had hoped, and there are a number of hurdles still to overcome.",
      "Parents say nursery places are increasingly difficult to find. And experts are concerned that a gap is widening between those who are eligible for the funded hours, and those who are missing out on the childcare revolution. So why has this challenge been too great for successive governments to solve?",
      "England's childcare deserts",
      "Over the last five years, access to childcare in England has declined. At the same time demand is increasing.",
      "The government estimates that by September, an additional 70,000 extra places and 35,000 staff will be needed to cope with the influx of families wanting spaces and more hours.",
      "A report by the regulator and inspector of early years, Ofsted, found that deprived areas that have lower than average incomes are disproportionately affected by persistently low access to childcare.",
      "Doncaster is a \"childcare desert\", defined as an area where parents have faced low childcare accessibility over time. There are 17 childcare places there for every 100 children.",
      "For Jordan Parker from Doncaster, the funded hours have been an \"absolute godsend\". Her two-year-old daughter Riley goes to nursery one day a week. Finding a place however has been increasing tricky.",
      "\"I have to set off at 5am for work and her Dad steps in for some mornings but he's a farmer so he works long hours, seven days a week, so I don't think we'd manage without family help.\"",
      "Olena Mykhaylyk says she put her daughter on the nursery list the moment she found out she was pregnant. \"It's crazy you have to be thinking that far ahead,\" she says.",
      "\"It's great the government offers these hours but if you can't use them, they become negligible.\"",
      "Childcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024, but from September, many families will look to increase nursery hours as the number they are eligible for doubles.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has conceded that parents in some areas may not be able to get their first choice childcare place in September. \"It is no secret that childcare in England has often been expensive and hard to find,\" Phillipson has previously said.",
      "\"This issue is historic, and in some places it is far worse than in others.\"",
      "Are school-based nurseries the solution?",
      "One of Labour's lead pledges last year was to create 100,000 additional childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries in schools.",
      "Analysis by think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), says it will increase the share of school-based provision from around 22% to 27% of the market, which is \"not nothing\", says the IFS's associate director Christine Farquharson. But she adds that is \"not going to be transformational\".",
      "It will also apply more to older children because it is easier for school-based settings to cater for three-year-olds, she adds.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said 1,200 schools had approached them about opening one. But that is still short of the number needed.",
      "Some 300 nursery schools were approved for funding in this first round, which the government says will create 6,000 new places in total. Of these, 4,000 will open in September.",
      "Avnee Morjaria, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), who worked for the DfE when the expansion programme was being developed, says the school-based nursery programme is a \"glimmer of hope\".",
      "\"If they are delivered and delivered well, I think that has got a lot of potential. It just makes sense in terms of communities and schools and nurseries being the hub of their communities to have that kind of policy.\"",
      "But for now, the system is still heavily reliant on private nurseries.",
      "Private nurseries are facing 'huge increases'",
      "There are more than 20,000 private and voluntary nurseries in the UK, which provide most early years places, but many are unhappy with the current situation and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work.",
      "Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), says most providers are facing \"huge increases\" in their operating costs from April, including statutory wage increases, changes to national insurance contributions and rising utility bills.",
      "The government says it is increasing its funding for all pre-school children to reflect the wage increases and is providing an additional \u00a375 million grant for nurseries to expand.",
      "But some nurseries say the money they receive for three-and-four-year olds is not enough and they can no longer subside it with the money parents pay for younger children - as from September the state will be paying for 80% of childcare in England.",
      "The DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary.",
      "This is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku.",
      "\"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\".",
      "Some nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether.",
      "But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".",
      "In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.",
      "Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.",
      "Working families and eligibility",
      "The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.",
      "To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.",
      "David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.",
      "\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.",
      "\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"",
      "The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.",
      "This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.",
      "Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.",
      "\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.",
      "\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"",
      "Question of child development",
      "The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)",
      "The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".",
      "The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.",
      "\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"",
      "In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.",
      "The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.",
      "Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.",
      "\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"",
      "She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.",
      "The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.",
      "A system under strain",
      "The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.",
      "What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.",
      "Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.",
      "It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.",
      "However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.",
      "\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"",

      "\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.",

      "Members of the National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, will vote on taking strike action if the government sticks with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year.",
      "They agreed to launch a formal ballot if the pay offer \"remains unacceptable or if the government does not announce real terms funding increases\".",
      "Are more strikes planned?",
      "The NEU announcement does not mean teachers in England are about to walk out.",
      "The union will need to reject a final decision from the government on teacher pay - including both the size of the pay rise, and whether or not there will be any additional funding for it.",
      "If it does launch a formal ballot, enough members would need to vote and support strike action. That ballot could open for several months, meaning any strike action would likely take place in the autumn term at the earliest.",
      "Last week, results from an informal ballot showed 93.7% of members rejected the offer and 83.4% said they would be willing to strike. The turnout was 47.2%.",
      "NEU members went on strike over pay in the first half of 2023, forcing many schools to close on eight days of action. The NEU called off action after the government revised its 2023 offer to 6.5%.",
      "Teachers were then given a 5.5% rise in 2024.",
      "In December, the government recommended a 2.8% pay rise for 2025.",
      "What do teachers want?",
      "England",
      "In a letter to Education Bridget Phillipson after the government's recommendation of a 2.8% pay rise, teaching unions said they had been clear that the 5.5% increase in 2024 \"must be only the first in a series of fully funded, above inflation pay increases needed to correct teacher and school leader pay\".",
      "They said that the value of teacher pay had fallen since 2010, which, coupled with \"excessive workload\", had contributed to a \"crisis\" in recruitment and retention.",
      "They also want the government to fund the pay rise so that schools do not have to pay for it through existing budgets. At present, the government expects, external that most schools will have to make \"efficiencies\" in order to afford the additional cost.",
      "Each year, the independent School Teachers Review Body (STRB) hears submissions from each side and makes recommendations on teacher pay to the government, who ultimately decide on how much to award.",
      "Wales",
      "The Welsh Government made a pay offer for 2024/25 in line with England's 5.5% teacher pay rise, which was higher than the 4.3% recommended by the Independent Welsh Pay Review Body (IWPRB).",
      "Long-running action ended in November 2023 after NAHT members accepted a new workload agreement along with an improved pay offer and additional funding.",

      "Northern Ireland",
      "A potential strike by Northern Ireland's teachers was averted this month.",
      "In February, teachers rejected an offer of 5.5% and started action short of strike in schools.",
      "But unions have now accepted a revised deal. The pay rise will remain at 5.5%, but the agreement also contained commitments to address concerns about workloads.",
      "Will my child's school close if strikes happen?",
      "Although none are currently planned, schools in England should open where possible in the event of a teachers' strike, the government says., external",
      "Teachers do not have to declare in advance if they intend to strike, and there are no rules about when parents must be told about school closures.",
      "Head teachers take a decision on whether to shut schools. Some parents may only be told about a closure on the morning of industrial action, once staff numbers are known.",
      "The new Labour government repealed the previous government's minimum service level law, which unions had called \"undemocratic\".",
      "Can parents take time off, and what else do you need to know?",
      "In England, you can ask for leave to care for \"family and dependants\", including emergency childcare.",
      "Your employer must not refuse a reasonable request, but you may not be paid. Alternatively you may be able to take holiday or unpaid parental leave.",
      "Schools are asked to prioritise vulnerable pupils and key workers' children during strikes. They are also asked to try to prevent, or reduce, any disruption to exams and other formal assessments.",
      "The NEU issued guidance to support arrangements for head teachers to \"provide the minimum level of teaching staff needed\" on strike days so students who had exams coming up could attend school.",
      "Schools must also support children eligible for benefits-related free school meals, external if they close.",
      "How much are teachers paid?",
      "Classroom teachers were paid an average of \u00a343,100 in the 2023/24 school year in England and \u00a347,340 in Wales. In Scotland teacher pay is higher, where fully qualified teachers who have passed their probation start on \u00a340,305.",

      "Experts advise ministers about teacher pay, based on factors such as vacancy rates and subject shortages.",
      "As with all public spending, money allocated in England is awarded proportionately to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

    "story": [
      "WrestleMania has come to a close with John Cena making history winning the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Championship for a record-breaking 17th time.",
      "The win over Cody Rhodes, which came following a surprise interference from rapper Travis Scott, means Cena has overtaken Ric Flair by winning more world titles than anyone in the history of the company.",
      "Cena previously announced he would retire at the end of 2025, meaning this was the final WrestleMania ever for the most decorated wrestler to ever set foot in a WWE ring (though most know never to say never in wrestling).",
      "Other new champions were crowned amid further twists and surprises, but none more significant than the final match of the weekend.",
      "It was a historic night for many reasons, not least that this was the first WrestleMania to air live on Netflix, where it could be watched by many of the firm's 300 million subscribers around the world.",
      "The company paid a pretty penny for the privilege - a 10 year $5bn (\u00a34bn) deal to bring WWE's weekly shows and monthly events to the streaming service (though not all territories get to see everything).",
      "Netflix's experience airing WWE shows since January - it says the first live show picked up just shy of five million views - seemed to pay dividends as WrestleMania aired largely without glitches.",
      "And the firms had an even greater argument to make for its significance before the first bell was rung, when WWE announced it had acquired Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, one of the largest wrestling promotions in Mexico.",
      "But fans will say all of that is fine and dandy - what matters is what happens between the ropes.",
      "And on that front, there would be few who left disappointed.",
      "A family affair",
      "The show could be said to have two main events - one on Saturday and another on Sunday - and the first night's show featured three of WWE's biggest stars.",
      "Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins and CM Punk met in a match the company billed as generational, in no small part due to the 46-year-old Punk finally getting to his first WrestleMania main event.",
      "The fans were firmly behind Punk to begin with, and the match lived up to the billing - a ferocious war with plenty of big moments and false finishes before a series of twists led to Rollins standing tall.",
      "The weekend had kicked off with a feel-good story as Jey Uso defeated Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship, the other major title men battle for in WWE.",
      "The more than 60,000 fans in attendance were not disappointed as Uso won his first ever world title to open the show on Saturday - in doing so, bettering the career achievements of his father, 90s and 00s wrestler Rikishi.",
      "This was not the only moment celebrating legacy - Dominik Mysterio, the son of WWE legend Rey Mysterio, won the Intercontinental Championship to mark his first ever title in the company.",
      "The title changes did not stop there, with the New Day (Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston) beating War Raiders, and Jacob Fatu winning his first ever title in WWE by defeating the popular LA Knight for the United States Championship.",
      "But the big moments were not limited to titles changing hands.",
      "Lynch returns",
      "It proved to be a massive weekend for WWE's women, who struggled to put a foot wrong across title matches, rivalries and a major return for a fan favourite.",
      "First, Becky Lynch, one of the most popular women to ever wrestle in the company, made a surprise return after a year out of action, with her appearance drawing tears from some in the live crowd.",
      "Lynch's return was a winning effort, picking up the Women's Tag Team Championships along with Lyra Valkyria, defeating champions Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez.",
      "WWE's fans had already been treated to several excellent matches by this point, with Jade Cargill - who joined a year ago from rival company AEW - beating Naomi on Saturday before Tiffany Stratton faced Charlotte Flair in a fierce fight for the Women's World Championship.",
      "Stratton beat Flair to defend her title in what felt like a proverbial handing of the torch from one of the WWE's most decorated champions to the new blood midway through her first title reign.",
      "Then on Sunday, the live crowd were on their feet for the opener between Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley and Bianca Belair for the Women's World Championship.",
      "Sky was able to successfully defend her title in what was a showcase match for all three women, which some online have already labelled \"an instant classic\".",
      "Ads disrupt matches",
      "But it was not all plain sailing for WWE.",
      "While the show was well-received by fans for the in-ring action, one thing that didn't go unnoticed was the quantity of adverts throughout the event.",
      "Brand names written on the ring canvas and a sports drink brand synonymous with YouTuber-turned-wrestler Logan Paul, who faced AJ Styles on Sunday, have become a common part of WWE furniture in recent years.",
      "But this WrestleMania seemed to pack in the ads far more than previous years, with one fan saying it was \"challenging to even focus\" on the action, and another even calling it \"Ad-a-Mania\".",
      "The adverts were even embedded into elements of the presentation itself, with multiple wrestlers making their way to the ring in special costumes designed to promote video games.",
      "And all that's before the ad breaks which split up the event.",
      "But it's worth remembering that for those who already had a Netflix subscription, this is the first WrestleMania they won't have had to shell out any extra money to see.",
      "While this event is often billed as a showpiece on par with cup finals, there is one big difference - tomorrow, WWE will continue on with the next chapter of its never-ending soap opera.",
      "And while the way Netflix bosses feel will come down to pure numbers, fans will surely be happy with what they saw in the ring this weekend."

      "Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.",
      "If you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.",
      "But in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention.",
      "Content creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.",
      "Latey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette).",
      "Ten women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas.",
      "Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.",
      "Broadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.",
      "Winning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".",
      "Of course, not everyone feels the same way.",
      "\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.",
      "\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"",
      "Mr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.",
      "Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"",
      "Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"",
      "Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.",
      "\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.",
      "\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"",
      "Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.",
      "In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.",
      "Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.",
      "\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.",
      "Elsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.",
      "By baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.",
      "Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.",
      "\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.",
      "\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"",
      "She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\"",
      "Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"",
      "A second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"",
      "Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.",
      "This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.",
      "\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.",
      "As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.",
      "\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.",
      "But Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".",

      "Race Across the World is as much about its contestants as the race and travelling. I'm mostly excited for the inevitable moving moments, as we see the teams pushed to their absolute limits.",
      "Self Esteem is A Complicated Woman",
      "By Mark Savage, music correspondent",
      "\"This album is going to get terrible reviews,\" Self Esteem predicted when I caught up with her last Christmas.",
      "Why? \"Because people hate women doing well,\" she laughed. \"I'm very ready for a male journalist to say it doesn't make sense, because it's a lot.\"",
      "That's kind of the point, though. Out on Friday, A Complicated Woman is an attempt to capture womanhood in all its complexities and contradictions \u2013 and that means moving through musical genres, modes and attitudes with almost whiplash-inducing speed.",
      "But Self Esteem, aka Rebecca Lucy Taylor, is too clever to mess it up. Her trademark wit and sincerity are firmly in place, as she talks candidly about social anxiety, crises of confidence, infantilised men, her least favourite sexual positions and being beaten down for speaking up.",
      "Highlights include The Curse, a stadium-sized ballad about using alcohol as an emotional crutch; and closing track The Deep Blue Okay, where she eventually finds a modicum of inner peace. Along the way, there are guest appearances from Nadine Shah, Moonchild Sanelly and even Coronation Street's Julie Hesmondhalgh.",
      "She launched the album with a flashy West End residency last week \u2013 where fans were delighted to discover that A Complicated Woman was an uncomplicated delight.",
      "More on the Mangione trial",
      "Luigi Mangione's case went viral after he was charged with killing healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in New York City in December.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to state charges, and has yet to enter a plea for separate federal charges.",
      "Some on social media have celebrated the 26-year-old, and shared anger at America's private health insurers.",
      "So what are the facts, and what are the conspiracies?",
      "The Mangione Trial, on BBC Sounds, aims to unpick this. The latest episode drops on Wednesday, and looks at how the US healthcare system works.",
      "It hears from a mother who says she spent $40,000 (\u00a330,000) on her daughter's treatment while also battling for her insurance to cover it.",
      "Future episodes will dive into what conspiracy theories are, and why people become so obsessed with them.",
      "Defying destiny in Clair Obscur and Until Dawn",
      "By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter",
      "Dark fantasy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, out Thursday for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Game Pass, quite literally caught people's eyes when it was first revealed at last year's Summer Game Fest.",
      "As video games go, it's a stunner, with gorgeous art direction heavily inspired by France's 19th century Belle \u00c9poque era.",
      "Players control a crew of characters on a quest to destroy the Paintress \u2013 a being who emerges once a year and scrawls a number onto a monolith. If someone's age matches the digits, they die (hence the 33 in the title).",
      "Somehow, the 30-person team at French developer Sandfall Interactive has also managed to attract some top-tier acting talent to the role-playing game (RPG) project, including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Gollum actor Andy Serkis, Final Fantasy XVI's Ben Starr and Baldur's Gate 3's Jennifer English.",
      "But the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around.",
      "If that doesn't take your fancy, video game adaptation Until Dawn is out in cinemas on Friday. Passionate fans of the 2015 \"interactive horror movie\" were concerned when the first trailer revealed the film's makers had swapped the game's trademark choose-your-own-adventure device for a Happy Death Day-style time loop.",
      "But with Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation director David F Sandberg and prolific horror writer Gary Dauberman on board, and a buzzy cast including Love, Victor star Michael Cimino and up-and-comer Ella Rubin, Until Dawn's fate isn't necessarily sealed yet.",

    "story": [
      "In 2001, the organisation responsible for England's forests launched a concert series in a bid to increase funding and visitor numbers.",
      "It was the brainchild of Mike Taylor, a manager at the Forestry Commission, now  Forestry England, who had a \"strong passion\" for music and the outdoors.",
      "In the 24 years since, Forest Live has become a mainstay of the music scene, with stars like Ed Sheeran, Massive Attack, Blondie, Madness and the Beach Boys performing among the nation's trees.",
      "This year's gigs will be held in June at Cannock Chase Forest in Staffordshire, Delamere Forest in Cheshire, Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire and High Lodge, Thetford Forest in Norfolk.",
      "Among the 2025 performers, which vary from venue to venue, are Sting, Snow Patrol, Gary Barlow, Nile Rodgers & CHIC, Rag'n'Bone Man and James.",
      "But according to Rhodri Jones, Forestry England's national events programme manager, staging the gigs was not an easy task.",
      "\"It's a really challenging environment and requires a big transformation,\" he said.",
      "\"The strengths and uniqueness of our sites are also what brings the greatest challenges.\"",
      "Getting people to the sites quickly and safely presented difficulties, Mr Jones said, as well as transporting and setting up the \"considerable\" infrastructure needed.",
      "\"It requires an enormous amount of planning by an incredibly skilled team to pull it all off,\" Mr Jones said.",
      "Then there's the impact on the forests themselves \u2013 home to a vast array of animal and plant life, described by Mr Jones as a \"constant consideration\" for Forestry England.",
      "He said the organisation made use of its in-house experts, who advise the teams on how to minimise impact on the environment.",
      "\"It would be counter-intuitive to present these concerts to protect and preserve the forest environments but do damage to them with the presentations themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"Our sites are home to incredible wildlife and plant life and the concerts are presented to raise funds for the protection and conservation of the nation's forests, so we must ensure that the concert operation does nothing to disturb the natural surroundings.\"",
      "Constructing the stages takes a team of about 50 people, which will grow to roughly 250 during show days.",
      "With capacities at the venues ranging from 8,000 to 10,000 concert-goers, Mr Jones said working out entry and exit points for traffic, as well as emergency access, can prove challenging.",
      "\"We must ensure everyone can get to and from the rural settings, so we set our capacities in line with that,\" he said.",
      "Then there's the English weather, with forests particularly vulnerable to extreme conditions like high winds and thunderstorms.",
      "Mr Jones said Forestry England was always \"alive to the dangers\" of natural challenges and aware of what it needed to do to protect the public.",
      "\"High structures along with the trees are susceptible to extreme weather events, so we must be reactive to forecasts and be prepared to cancel a show and issue refunds if there is any danger to the public,\" he said.",
      "Tickets for the concerts start at between \u00a350 and \u00a360, with all money raised going towards maintaining forests across the country, contributing towards Forestry England's efforts to plant 7m trees a year.",
      "\"The experience is one of complete disconnect from the pace and noise of modern life - and connection with music, nature and a sea of like-minded concert-goers,\" Mr Jones said.",
      "\"By attending a concert, you are also investing in the future of these incredible spaces, as the funds raised go towards preserving the nation's forests for generations to come.\"",

      "Kajoba said his parents pushed him academically, but he spent a lot of his youth learning to play piano, violin and the harp while enjoying after school and weekend drama clubs.",
      "A pivotal moment he said was when he was inspired by a show at the Wolsey Theatre in Ipswich.",
      "\"I didn't really know what it meant to be an actor, whether that was something that someone could do,\" he explained.",

      "During his A-levels, he set his sights on Juilliard and started the long application process while applying to UK universities as a \"backup plan\".",

      "\"Out of between 6,000 to 8,000 people, 18 got in.\"",
      "Kajoba started online classes in July 2020 before later moving to New York in October for his studies.",
      "\"Across the four years, we only perform publicly in the third and fourth year because the first two years are all about the interior work you do as an actor,\" he added.",
      "\"One thing the head of the division always used to say is, 'We are training you for a 70-year career'.",
      "\"It's about building yourself as a true artist.\"",
      "In his fourth year, Kajoba was signed to a New York talent agency and he received the John Houseman Award for acting.",
      "It is given to the actor who displays exceptional ability in classic theatre and he said it was \"an honour to be part of that legacy\".",

      "\"Of course that changes everyday, but I'm just so grateful for that gift and the fact I get to honour that in every play, film, whatever that I do.\"",

      "\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.",
      "\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.",
      "\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.",
      "\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"",
      "Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling further afield.",
      "\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.",
      "\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"",
      "He adds: \"You're helping local people and you're trying something new.\"",
      "Since his big TV win, Watts has been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.",
      "Another time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.",
      "And he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Wood for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. \"That was a really nice moment,\" he says.",
      "Watts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his \"own company\" and doing things on his \"own terms\", while also meeting new people.",
      "He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\".",
      "\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.",
      "He does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.",
      "\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"",
      "Bucket list",
      "His favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.",
      "One thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.",
      "\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.",
      "\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"",
      "As well as becoming far better travelled, the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways, acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK, a mental health charity for young people, and Winston's Wish, a children and young people's grief charity.",
      "One of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.",
      "Speaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].",

      "\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"",
      "His \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".",
      "He'd also suggest taking \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.",
      "\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.",

      "Alexandra Johnson was already grieving her mother's death when Covid-19 hit the UK in 2020.",
      "As a former city trader, she had no formal art qualifications, but she nonetheless decided to manage the boredom and channel her grief by painting in her kitchen.",
      "The mother-of-three has gone on to sell her works - painted exclusively with a palette knife and spatula - for five-figure sums.",

      "She became a full-time carer for her own mother in 2017 after her cancer diagnosis, and Janet died in February 2019.",
      "The 53-year-old recalled how \"we were really bored\" when the first lockdown was imposed and she was still \"fresh in grief\".",

      "Janet had already sacrificed her own health by giving a kidney to one of her brothers when she was 60 years old.",
      "The painter said she was forever in awe of how women supported other women in times of crisis, and she described how her work paid \"homage\" to their \"strength and grace\".",
      "She says her paintings explore memory, femininity and resilience.",

    "summary": "The singer describes the troubled gestation of her third album, as she launches it on the West End.",
    "story": [
      "\"Please be upstanding for the world's most confusing House of Games contestant and Bake Off failure, Self Esteem!\"",
      "This is how Rebecca Lucy Taylor \u2013 aka celebrated pop singer Self Esteem \u2013 is introduced to the stage at London's Duke of York's Theatre.",
      "It's a typically irreverent comment, an example of the dry wit she uses to sweeten the sincerity and anger of her music.",
      "\"You can take piccies and videos,\" the off-stage voice continues, \"because she needs all the help she can get.\"",
      "That, too, is strictly tongue-in-cheek.",
      "Three years ago, Taylor released her second album, Prioritise Pleasure, a body-shaking manifesto for female self-worth that bristled at society's expectations while acknowledging her own shortcomings (\"Sexting you at the mental health talk seems counterproductive,\" she observed on Moody).",
      "After 10 years in mid-ranking indie band Slow Club, the album propelled her into uncharted realms.",
      "There were magazine covers, nominations for the Mercury Prize and Brit Awards, a starring role on stage in Cabaret, a support slot with Adele and, yes, an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off \u2013 where, unfortunately, she burned her crumpets.",
      "\"The week that Prioritise Pleasure came out, my whole life changed,\" she reflects.",
      "\"Not financially or in terms of fame, but it's like there was a knot in my stomach that untied.",
      "\"Then everyone was like, 'Right, can you do that again, please?'\"",
      "Taylor tore herself in two to make the follow-up, A Complicated Woman, which comes out on Friday.",
      "After playing it live for the first time in the West End on Wednesday, she describes the album's gestation process as \"horrible\", \"lonely\", and \"painful\".",
      "\"It just felt really stressful to execute what was in my head,\" she explains in a phone interview the next morning.",
      "\"I was thinking so big, but I still don't have access to the resources I need to make it as big as I wanted.\"",
      "Part of the problem was a punishing, but self-imposed, time limit.",
      "\"The music industry is like, 'You've got 10 minutes, then you're over and someone else is going to take your place',\" she explains.",
      "\"So I felt like I had no choice [but to commit to another record] if I wanted to build on what I'd done.",
      "\"But as painful as it was and as dark as it got, the second I'm back on stage performing it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is why I love it'.\"",
      "It all unravels",
      "She hasn't just made a new album - she has also created a daring, jaw-dropping theatrical experience to go with it.",
      "It's set in a sparse recreation of the community centre where eight-year-old Becky from Rotherham learned to tap dance.",
      "\"You just wanted to sing / You didn't know what that would bring,\" recalls an older, more cynical version of that child \u2013 as she assesses her life at the age of 38.",
      "\"This really is all there is, and that's what you've got to get comfortable with.\"",
      "As the show opens, 10 dancers line up on either side of her, dressed in austere outfits that recall The Handmaid's Tale.",
      "Initially, their movements are stiff and restricted but, as Taylor describes suffocating relationships with emotionally-stunted men, they start to thrash and jerk their bodies.",
      "\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.",
      "\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"",
      "A four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.",
      "Several times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.",
      "\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?",
      "\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"",
      "In the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.",
      "The music becomes a soundtrack to solidarity - which, it transpires, was Taylor's intention.",
      "A Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.",
      "\"Do you remember the Elbow song One Day Like This?\" she asks. \"The one that goes, 'Throw those curtains wii-iide'?",
      "\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"",
      "\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"",
      "That's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.",
      "Recent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.",
      "\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs.",
      "\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.",
      "\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"",
      "Those moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.",
      "Her personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.",
      "\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap.",
      "\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"",
      "It's a feeling Taylor immediately recognised.",
      "As excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.",
      "\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.",
      "\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"",
      "Eventually, the criticism took its toll.",
      "\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"But over the last few years, especially with the world being like it is, I've definitely had feelings of protecting myself and shutting up.",
      "\"That's the saddest part of the album, really. But I found a way through.",
      "\"And if I can, then I hope the rest of the world can too, you know?\"",
      "That realisation is the connecting tissue of A Complicated Woman.",
      "Life is never easy, she says. No-one is ever truly satisfied. Relationships are hard work. You can't please everyone. But that's OK. You're OK. Trust your gut.",
      "She sums it up on Focus Is Power, held aloft by the sound of a gospel choir: \"And now I see it clear with every passing of each year / I deserve to be here.\"",
      "On stage in London, she sings those final lines a capella with her dancers and backing singers, arms wrapped around each other in a display of female solidarity.",
      "It's a cathartic moment after the bruising process of putting the album together.",
      "\"There's so much joy in being a woman and just being yourself can be beautiful,\" she says. \"You've just got to find a way to do it.\"",
      "With that, she's off to make tweaks for the show's second night. After that, she has to find a way to scale down the West End production for a UK tour.",
      "\"I'll do what I can to make it continue, but it's a huge risk because there's so little revenue from anything else,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, though, her ambition is undimmed.",
      "\"I want to make 20 albums, I want to do bigger theatre shows,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course it'd be useful if I could 'cross over' because everything gets easier when you've got more resources.",

    "summary": "The festival returns for a second weekend in the Californian desert. Here's how to watch at home.",
    "story": [
      "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry!",
      "Lady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.",
      "Better yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).",
      "With that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.",
      "1) Lady Gaga confronts her inner demons",
      "Lady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.",
      "Her second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.",
      "Staged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's  inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.",
      "During Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.",
      "It was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off.",
      "If you only watch one performance, make it this one.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "2) Missy Elliot makes up for lost time",
      "Despite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year.",
      "Luckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.",
      "She arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.",
      "The only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "3) Lola Young fights the flu",
      "\"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".",
      "The British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.",
      "With her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.",
      "Watch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "4) Green Day are 'not part of the MAGA agenda'",
      "Although Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.",
      "They plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".",
      "That aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "5) Post Malone's good-time hoedown",
      "\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"",
      "It might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.",
      "He rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.",
      "It all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).",
      "Surprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two.",
      "As someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).",
      "6) Back to Black(pink)",
      "In 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.",
      "Lisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.",
      "After her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Ros\u00e9 (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).",
      "Jennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.",
      "Highlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break -  and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.",
      "The 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers.",
      "Watch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).",
      "7) Brat Summer 2: Electric Boogaloo",
      "Charli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.",
      "Performing entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.",
      "Compared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.",
      "At several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".",
      "Whether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen. But Charli is worth your time either way.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 7:15pm on Saturday (local time), or 3:15am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "8) Benson Boone vs d4vd",
      "Anyone who's had the pleasure of watching Benson Boone over the last year will know he's fond of performing a front flip off his piano, the big show off.",
      "He didn't let us down at Coachella - bouncing around the stage like a Duracell Bunny attached to a car battery. To cap it all off, he brought out Brian May for a surprisingly successful version of Bohemian Rhapsody.",
      "Less fortunate, however, was Texan singer d4vd, whose attempt at a backflip went disastrously wrong.",
      "Thankfully, he recovered in time to pull off an energetic set that highlighted the life-affirming vibes of his bedroom pop hits Feel It and What Are You Waiting For.",
      "After the set, he swore to practice harder for this weekend's performance. \"Imagine if I fall again,\" he cringed.",
      "Watch Benson Boone on the Coachella Stage at 7:05pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45 am on Saturday (UK Time). D4vd plays the Gobi Stage at 5:55pm on Friday (local time), or 1:55am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "9) Gustavo Dudamel's genre-defying live mixtape",
      "Last Saturday, the entire LA Philharmonic Orchestra boarded a bus and set off for the desert to make their Coachella debut.",
      "Under the baton of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, they performed what was billed as \"Gustavo's mixtape\" - moving seamlessly between classical standards like Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and modern pop hits.",
      "For the latter, they were joined on stage by a host of A-list stars, including indie titan Beck, Icelandic songstress Laufey, country singer Maren Morris and rap icon LL Cool J.",
      "\"I told to the orchestra, 'I'm so happy conducting, but I wish I could be in the middle of the crowd and enjoy the moment,'\" Dudamel told Variety magazine ahead of the show.",
      "Weekend two will feature an all-new array of guest stars, he promised, but details are being kept under wraps for now.",
      "The LA Philharmonic plays the Outdoor Theatre at 6:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 2:25am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "10) T-Pain is the ultimate party starter",
      "\"It took me 20 years to get on this stage,\" said T-Pain towards the end of his set on Saturday, and he certainly made the most of his hour-long set.",
      "He covered Journey's Don't Stop Believin' and Chris Stapleton's country hit Tennessee Whiskey, while racing through early 2000s hits like Buy U A Drank and I'm In Luv, and revisiting his verses on Flo Rida's Low, and Kanye West's Good Life.",
      "For that, he received a hero's welcome, with the crowd treating his set as an excuse for some turn of the millennium escapism.",
      "By the time it ended, a campaign had started for T-Pain to play next year's Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 5:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 1:25am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "Other sets worth watching",
      "Luckily, you're not forced to stay up all night to watch the stars strut their stuff in California.",
      "Coachella's generous livestreams repeat throughout the day, and you can rewind several hours to find the performances you want.",
      "Other highlights from the first weekend included Megan Thee Stallion, whose star-studded set included appearances from Queen Latifah, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, and Ciara; and Kraftwerk, reminding everyone that they essentially invented electronic music.",
      "Belinda Carlisle reunited with her old band The Go-Gos for a dose of sun-kissed 1980s nostalgia, and the UK's Sam Fender tore through a blistering set that showcased the songwriting chops of his new album, People Watching.",
      "Among the newcomers with main stage aspirations were South Africa's hip-swivelling R&B star Tyla, and New York dance act Fcukers, whose breakout hit Bon Bon was one of the weekend's most inescapable tracks.",
      "You can see the full line-up for Coachella's second weekend on the festival's website."

      "Millions of wrestling fans across the world are gearing up for this weekend's much-anticipated annual finale - WrestleMania 41.",
      "Just ask seven-year-old Oliver, who's spent the past week of his school holidays waking his dad, Paul, at 6:30 to eagerly count down the days.",
      "He's even being allowed to get up at midnight to watch it, because, as one of the 17 million UK households subscribed to Netflix, the family now has live ringside access to the two-night Las Vegas extravaganza.",
      "It means Oliver will finally get to find out if 16-time champion John Cena, who's recently flipped from hero to villain as part of his farewell tour (leaving Oliver in shock), can defeat Cody Rhodes in a record-breaking win before retirement.",
      "It's all part of a $5bn (\u00a34bn) mega-deal bringing World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) archive and biggest events to the streamer - with WrestleMania now available live on Netflix in many international territories for the very first time. US viewers, however, will still be watching on NBC's Peacock, at least for now.",
      "The 10-year contract, which began earlier this year, connects WWE with a potential global audience of 700 million. It's central to WWE chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque's vision of making wrestling globally accessible and relevant to a new generation of streaming era fans.",
      "The stakes are high. WrestleMania, which began in 1985, is being treated as a litmus test - not just for WWE's global expansion, but for Netflix's potential move into live sports.",
      "But will this blockbuster tag-team partnership pay off, or will it prove one (very) expensive fight too far?",
      "On-demand chokehold",
      "The Netflix/WWE deal reflects changes in viewing habits, and also speaks to WWE's eagerness to be promoted by the \"winner of the streaming wars\", the Wrestlenomics website editor Brandon Thurston tells the BBC.",
      "After years of relying on cable pay-per-view  - which charged US viewers a hefty $60 (\u00a345) per event - WWE launched its own network in 2014. The company took most of its pay-per-view events in house, aware that half the revenue was being lost to satellite companies.",
      "The move paid off, says Thurston, as prices for pay-per-view events dropped significantly to around $10 (\u00a37.50), creating \"a larger audience than ever\".",
      "The Netflix deal is, according to Thurston, part of WWE's plans to recruit globally, create bigger international stars, and amplify its live tournaments such as Raw, WrestleMania and Smackdown across different markets.",
      "As WWE's Levesque told the Ankler podcast, Netflix's universal \"simplicity\" felt game-changing: \"No matter where you are in the globe, there it is right in front of you. It's one click, and you're on and you're in\".",
      "Good thing too, as Levesque says younger audiences have \"no concept\" of traditional television, and increasingly view on-demand streaming as the norm, alongside video platforms like YouTube and TikTok.",
      "It's certainly made Oliver a megafan, and he is now able to watch the weekly Smackdown and Raw shows with his dad. Previously, without a TNT sport subscription, his options were limited to the monthly events available on the WWE network.",
      "\"Now that WWE is on Netflix, he watches it probably four times a week. It's his go-to programme,\" says Paul.",
      "\"It's really opened up a huge door for him. What's great for me as a dad is I used to be into wrestling when I was his age as well, so it's nice to share that journey with him\".",
      "And he's far from alone. On Thursday, industry magazine Broadcast reported that the move to Netflix had significantly increased UK engagement with both shows, with Raw ranked among the platform's top 10 shows in nine of its first 10 weeks.",
      "The picture is less clear in the US. Back in February, Mark Shapiro, a chief at WWE parent company TKO, told investors that Raw viewership was up 13% for the year to date compared to its previous home on USA Network - rising to 38% if the heavily promoted opening night is included.",
      "However, Thurston's research suggests that Raw and Smackdown viewership has since levelled off to numbers seen on USA.",
      "And figures are continuing to fall, not to an alarming amount, but certainly indicating that, potentially, weekly events on the streamer may not be as much of a growth area as major live events.",
      "Regardless, he sees the trade-off as worth it for Netflix in the long run - particularly looking ahead to WrestleMania's global debut tonight, which is expected to break streaming records.",
      "'Boots on the ground'",
      "When former longtime WWE CEO Vince McMahon dreamt up WrestleMania more than 40 years ago, he envisaged a Superbowl-style set piece event to unite the franchise's commercial partnerships and burrow it deeper within popular culture.",
      "That's why 1985's first WrestleMania was heavily promoted through MTV and held at New York's Madison Square Garden - featuring everyone from wrestler Hulk Hogan to A-team actor Mr T, popstar Cyndi Lauper and Muhammad Ali as a referee.",
      "\"We were trying to make a statement as to what our business is,\" McMahon told Netflix's 2024 docuseries, \"all forms of entertainment rolled into one\".",
      "And yet despite turning WWE into a media empire, McMahon departed in disgrace - first in 2022 and then again in 2024, amid various controversies - including an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit. McMahon's attorney, Jessica Rosenberg, denied the claims.",
      "Thurston feels McMahon's tight grip on creative business decisions also stifled WWE's storytelling in later years. Under Levesque, Thurston says that's changed in favour of collaboration. He says stories feel fresher, gender representation has improved and US event attendance is up.",
      "For Jonny Pivaral, who grew up watching during what he calls McMahon's \"bra and panties match\" era of the 2000s, the evolution is welcome. \"Back then, women were just eye candy,\" he says. \"Now they're being showcased on the same level as the men.\"",
      "This shift will be on full display when women's wrestling storylines take centre stage at WrestleMania. Top stars Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, and IYO SKY are to face off in a triple-threat match, while women's champion Tiffany Stratton will fight the legendary Charlotte Flair - in a battle that underlines the division's growing value.",
      "Attracting new audiences matters, Thurston says, because WWE's global strategy now hinges on fees paid by cities hosting these events (including WrestleMania), both inside and outside the USA.",
      "\"They want WrestleMania to become like the World Cup or Olympics, where there's a bidding war,\" he explains. \"Las Vegas is paying them $5 million for this year's event,\" he adds, noting that London has been heavily touted as a potential WrestleMania host city.",
      "Netflix's 'Sportainment' bet",
      "Finding a home on a streaming giant may be great news for WWE - but what does Netflix stand to gain from the partnership?",
      "According to James English, managing partner at sports and entertainment marketing agency Fuse, Netflix is \"stating loud and clear that it wants to dominate 'sportainment'\".",
      "Netflix has no input into making of WWE, says Triple H",
      "The WWE streaming deal is, he says, a major reason why Netflix beat expectations with its financial figures on Thursday, delivering 13% revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025.",
      "English sees WrestleMania as the natural progression in their drive to use sport to attract viewers to \"cultural moments\".",
      "This began last November with Mike Tyson taking on YouTuber Jake Paul in an influencer-boxing hybrid bout that drew in 60 million households - perhaps benefitting from cross-generational appeal.",
      "This first foray into live sports attracted complaints of crashing and buffering but the issues were largely fixed for Netflix's two NFL matches on Christmas Day a month later, part of a new three-year deal to show Christmas Day fixtures.",
      "English says that unlike Apple or Amazon Prime, which bought packages to the Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Premier League, Netflix's focus on \"event\" viewing allows them to make best use of their personalised advert and interface data.",
      "WrestleMania exemplifies this strategy. As a \"live, global, fan-driven deal that blends sports, entertainment and storytelling\", English says Netflix could stand to make huge profits from its WWE partnership.",
      "The big question, of course, is whether wider Netflix audience interest will last the rounds.",
      "But it may be a gamble worth taking - for all involved. Just ask Oliver and his Dad at midnight."

      "The mineral is added to some water supplies and brands of toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "'Bit of a cheap shot'",
      "For BBC Radio 4's Dead Ringers star Jan Ravens, the first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was \"not reading the room\".",
      "It was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking \"those all-American, fake-looking teeth\".",
      "\"In the wake of all that, she's been talking about how she was bullied at school and the butt of jokes. So then you think, 'why would you do that joke'?\"",
      "It meant that in making fun of Wood's appearance, the sketch \"punched down,\" says Ravens.",
      "\"You might make a joke about Donald Trump's appearance because you're definitely not punching down on the most powerful man in the western world.\"",
      "Ronni Ancona, co-writer and star of the early 2000s TV series The Big Impression, said she \"could see\" that the writers were also trying to make a point about US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's pledge to remove fluoride from US drinking water.",
      "But in doing so, \"they would have made this tenuous link between fluoride and Aimee Lou's teeth. It's a bit of a cheap shot,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "After the show aired, Wood, 31, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".",
      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday. \"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "Later on, in a post on social media, she said: \"I've had apologies from SNL.\"",
      "However, Francine Lewis, a comedian whose impersonations have earned her a large following on social media, says the whole purpose of the US show is to \"take the mick\".",
      "While she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".",
      "In her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".",

      "But she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".",
      "Rather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"",
      "'Got to have the mickey taken'",
      "It's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image.",

    "summary": "Portraying some of the most famous people on the planet has its challenges, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted.",
      "Earlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.",
      "Actors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.",
      "Their performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.",
      "'Suspend disbelief'",
      "Perhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era.",
      "On the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double).",
      "But on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".",
      "So should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?",
      "Beatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism.",
      "\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief.",
      "\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"",
      "Du Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.",
      "\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"",
      "But he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.",
      "\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"",
      "So does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?",
      "Du Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch.",
      "\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"",
      "'Don't hear it any more'",
      "Edda Sharpe, a voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.",
      "Among them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.",
      "Beatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it.",
      "The performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.",
      "\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.",
      "\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"",
      "She said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.",
      "But she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.",
      "\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.",
      "\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"",
      "'More Scouse'",
      "Dr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.",
      "He said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.",
      "\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.",
      "\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.",
      "\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"",
      "But what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films?",
      "Michael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.",
      "Hawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can.",
      "\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.",
      "\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.",
      "\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"",
      "The 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.",
      "He added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.",
      "\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"",

    "summary": "In an NHS survey, 48% of men said they felt pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Dan Somers started to experience a series of strange and unexplained symptoms. He had severe chest pain, was unable to keep food or even water down and kept \"chucking up bile\".",
      "Though he had a sense that something might be wrong, Dan was reluctant to seek medical help. \"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors,\" the 43-year-old from Ipswich tells the BBC. \"I didn't want to be a burden.\"",
      "Dan's pain continued to get worse, until he was \"near enough screaming on the floor in pain\" and had to take time off work. It was the worst pain he's ever experienced, he says upon reflection.",
      "But \"I honestly thought I could try and fix it,\" Dan recalls.",
      "It was his wife who finally managed to push Dan to see the doctor.",
      "His GP sent him straight to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and spent a week recovering. He was told he had been close to getting sepsis.",
      "Dan's story mirrors those of other men who've told the BBC they've also put off seeking medical treatment - often until their symptoms became unbearable or until a loved one pushed them to get help.",
      "It's well known that men go to the doctors less than women, and data backs this up.",
      "The NHS told the BBC it doesn't release demographic data about GP appointments. But according to the ONS Health Insight Survey from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.",
      "Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and \"rarely or never\" used a pharmacy, too.",
      "They also make up considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.",
      "Men are \"less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function,\" says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.",
      "This all affects men's health outcomes.",
      "Experts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.",
      "In the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.",
      "Society associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. \"Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves\".",
      "\"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns,\" says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.",
      "\"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need,\" she adds.",
      "'Men are inherent problem-solvers'",
      "Kevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.",
      "\"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem,\" says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.",
      "This is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report \"self-managing\" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.",
      "\"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence,\" Prof Galdas says.",
      "Prof Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.",
      "Services also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.",
      "Women, in contrast, are \"sort of forced to engage in the health system\" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.",
      "And they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.",
      "Because women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.",
      "And men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative. Men are, for example, less likely to take part in the NHS's bowel cancer screening programme. As Prof Galdas says: \"men often seek help when symptoms disrupt their ability to function.\"",
      "'Massive waste of time'",
      "For Jonathan Anstee, 54, from Surrey, it took his symptoms getting drastically worse for him to book a doctors appointment, after months of stomach aches and blood in his stool.",
      "\"The pain got a lot worse and the blood got a lot worse,\" Jonathan says. \"But even when I went to the doctors, I was sat in the waiting room thinking 'this is a massive waste of time'.\"",
      "He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in September 2022.",
      "Throughout his life he'd generally avoided doctors appointments, Jonathan says. And as a father, \"you're used to worrying about your kids and not yourself,\" he says. Going to the doctors for himself, not his children, seemed \"a bit sort of indulgent\", he says.",
      "Last year, Jonathan was told his bowel cancer was stage four.",
      "Having blood in his stool had felt too embarrassing to talk to his friends and family about at the time. Jonathan's advice to other men is: \"There is absolutely no need to be embarrassed. The alternative could kill you - literally.\"",
      "'Connection can make a big difference'",
      "In recent years, support groups for men with cancer and mental health conditions have sprung up.",
      "Matthew Wiltshire started the men's charity the Cancer Club after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015. He died in 2023.",
      "Matthew felt there wasn't a space \"where men were openly talking about what it's like to go through cancer,\" his son, Oliver Wiltshire, says. \"He also noticed how much of the emotional load was being carried by the women around him.\"",
      "Through the Cancer Club, men can message online and attend sports events together.",
      "\"Whether it's practical advice, honest chat or just knowing someone else gets it, that connection can make a big difference,\" Oliver adds.",
      "Experts say that while men's attitudes towards healthcare are gradually changing for the better, more work still needs to be done.",
      "Prof Galdas believes men will engage more if services are redesigned to meet their needs - proactively offering support, having flexible access and focusing on practical action to improve mental health issues.",
      "\"There's good evidence from gender-responsive programmes in mental health, cancer care, and health checks showing this consistently,\" he says.",
      "For Dr Pillon, it's adding general health checks for men in their 20s to get them more used to accessing medical care.",
      "They're already available through the NHS for people aged 40 to 74, but introducing them for younger men who might not otherwise go to the doctors would \"embed the idea that you can come and use health services\", he says.",

    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",
      "\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"",
      "Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.",
      "NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.",
      "\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"",
      "Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",
      "A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.",
      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",
      "\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"",

    "summary": "The number of people vaping in the UK has stalled, while disposable vape usage has fallen, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests.",
      "The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say.",
      "But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban \u2013 instead of giving up.",
      "As a result they warn the ban may only have a \"limited impact\" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth.",
      "The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.",
      "The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm.",
      "GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is \"very clear\" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking.",
      "\"But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,\" she said.",
      "\"Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected.\"",
      "The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced.",
      "The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over.",
      "Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%.",
      "In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%.",
      "After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds.",
      "The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device.",
      "Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether.",
      "\"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds.",
      "Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term.",
      "A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models.",
      "\"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says.",
      "While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\".",
      "\"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says.",
      "\"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds.",

    "story": [
      "Members of the World Health Organization (WHO) have agreed the text of a legally binding treaty designed to better tackle future pandemics.",
      "The pact is meant to avoid the disorganisation and competition for resources seen during the Covid-19 outbreak.",
      "Key elements include the rapid sharing of data about new diseases, to ensure scientists and pharmaceutical companies can work more quickly to develop treatments and vaccines.",
      "For the first time, the WHO itself will also have an overview of global supply chains for masks, medical gowns and other personal protective equipment (PPE).",
      "WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the deal as \"a significant milestone in our shared journey towards a safer world\".",
      "\"[Member states] have also demonstrated that multilateralism is alive and well, and that in our divided world, nations can still work together to find common ground, and a shared response to shared threats,\" he said.",
      "'Historic agreement'",
      "The legally binding pact reached early on Wednesday came after three years of talks between member states.",
      "It is only the second time in the WHO's 75-year history that an international agreement of this type has been reached \u2013 the first being a tobacco control deal in 2003.",
      "It still needs to be formally adopted by members when they meet for the World Health Assembly next month.",
      "US negotiators were not part of the final discussions after President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the global health agency, and the US will not be bound by the pact when it leaves in 2026.",
      "Under the terms agreed, countries will have to ensure that pandemic-related drugs are available across the world in a future outbreak.",
      "Participating manufacturers will have to allocate 10% of their production of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to the WHO. Another 10% will then be supplied at \"affordable prices\".",
      "Countries also approved the transfer of health technologies to poorer nations as long as it was \"mutually agreed\".",
      "That should enable more local production of vaccines and medicines during a pandemic, but the clause had been extremely contentious.",
      "Developing countries are still angry at the way wealthy nations bought up and hoarded vaccines during Covid-19, while countries with large pharmaceutical industries worry mandatory transfers might undermine research and development.",
      "At the core of the agreement is a proposed Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System (PABS), allowing the faster exchange of data between pharmaceutical companies.",
      "That should enable those firms to start working on new drugs more quickly in any future outbreak."

      "Northern Scotland has one of the highest rates of Huntington's disease in the world, according to a new study.",
      "Huntington's is a hereditary disorder that slowly damages the brain, affecting the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, make decisions and live independently. There is currently no cure.",
      "The study confirmed the rate of Huntington's disease in northern Scotland is 14.5 per 100,000 people - more than five times the estimated worldwide rate of 2.71.",
      "The researchers from the University of Aberdeen found there are more than 160 adults living in Grampian, Highland, Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles who have the gene but have not been tested.",
      "Every child of someone affected has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the neurodegenerative gene which causes Huntington's.",
      "On average, every person who has been diagnosed with Huntington's disease will have at least another 2.2 relatives who have the gene, meaning there are hundreds of people in northern Scotland who could be considered for effective treatments in the future, researchers said.",
      "Previous studies have mainly looked at the number of people who tested positive for the gene then estimated the number of relatives at risk using statistical modelling.",
      "In the new study, published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, scientists used family tree clinical records to count how many people have a 50:50 chance of having inherited the condition but have not been tested.",
      "It is hoped the findings can help affected families plan for the future and prompt future investment in specialist care.",

      "They say the decision to be tested for the gene is entirely a personal choice.  While some people might want to know if they have inherited the Huntington's gene, others prefer not to unless they develop symptoms.",
      "\"Previous work looked at how many people in the area have been tested for Huntington's disease, that is people diagnosed with Huntington's disease signs and those with a gene alteration that will develop the condition in later life,\" Prof  Miedzybrodzka explained.",
      "\"However, no-one has properly counted just how many people who haven't been tested yet must have the gene.",

      "Fire services face a similar rise in their wages bill \u2013 but the 31 that are directly funded by the government will only get top-up funds that cover 50% of the increase on average, according to BBC research.",

      "The Treasury says it will cover the extra costs faced by government departments and public sector employers.",
      "In February, the then minister for policing, Dame Diana Johnson, told MPs the national insurance increases would be \"fully funded\" in the police settlement \u2013 the annual funding agreement for forces in England and Wales.",
      "The government also provided \u00a3502m in top-up funds for fire authorities and councils in their annual settlement grant to cover Nics rises.",
      "But the National Fire Chiefs Council says that even with the extra money fire services will be \u00a320m short of the \u00a340m needed to cover national insurance increases.",
      "The BBC contacted all 43 fire authority in England to ask how much the NICs increase is set to cost and cross-referenced that with the size of the grant they are getting to compensate for it.",
      "The data obtained shows the average shortfall to be 50%.",
      "It covers three quarters of the fire services in England and Wales, because 10 fire authorities do not separate out grant money from the money given to the whole county council.",
      "But the Home Office's own estimate is that the cost of the Nics rise to all fire authorities is \u00a340m, which also lends weight to the fire chiefs' claims of a 50% shortfall.",
      "NFCC chair Phil Garrigan said: \"Bridging this gap in funding and making sure there is sustained investment in fire and rescue will be crucial for ensuring we can continue to keep communities safe.",

      "\"If national insurance contributions are not covered fully by central funds, this will further eat into fire service budgets,\" he said.",
      "\"When compared to the police, the cost of covering the rise in national insurance contributions for the fire service is very small, so we urge the government to do the right thing and to avoid another de-facto cut.\"",
      "Funding for fire services is complex because there are several different types of fire authority split into two funding models - but nearly three-quarters of fire authorities have received direct grants from the government, worth \u00a311.9m overall.",
      "Those direct grants were provided to 31 fire authorities - five authorities run by metro mayors and 26 combined fire authorities (CFAs), five of which have Police, Fire and Crime Commissioners (PFCCs).",
      "The biggest shortfall was 67% in West Yorkshire, followed by 60% in Humberside, and the smallest was 17% in Essex, followed by 32% in Cumbria.",
      "There are 10 more fire authorities where a county council runs the fire service, and Nics grants for the fire service were mixed in with the Nics top-ups for council staff, making the total for just the fire service difficult to untangle.",
      "London and Greater Manchester also have their own structures, where the mayor has overall responsibility for Fire and Rescue services, and funding is again not separated out from Nics grants for council staff.",

    "summary": "The landmark ruling could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
      "It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.",
      "The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.",
      "Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",
      "Five key takeaways from Supreme Court ruling",
      "Women's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change?",
      "The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.",
      "The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.",
      "Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation.",
      "He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.",
      "\"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\"",
      "He added that the legislation gives transgender people \"protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender\".",
      "Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears.",
      "The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including \"sex\" and \"gender reassignment\".",
      "Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by \"sex\" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, \"certificated\" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.",
      "The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex \"for all purposes\".",
      "For Women Scotland argued for a \"common sense\" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\".",
      "Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: \"Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex.",
      "\"Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.\"",
      "First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement.",
      "He posted on social media: \"The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.",
      "\"We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.\"",
      "Swinney added: \"Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.\"",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted \"in good faith\" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.",
      "A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs\".",
      "\"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" the spokesman added.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "She added: \"It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.\"",
      "'Deep concern'",
      "Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.\"",
      "But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: \"This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.",
      "\"It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.\"",
      "For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.",
      "Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.",
      "Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was \"shocked\" by the court ruling, arguing that it \"reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates\".",
      "They added: \"This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.",
      "\"It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\"",
      "The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.",
      "NHS Fife said it would \"carefully consider\" the court's judgement.",
      "'Biological' or 'certified'?",
      "The judges ruled that interpreting sex as \"certificated\" rather than \"biological\" would \"cut across the definitions of man and \"woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way\".",
      "They said a \"certified\" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.",
      "The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to \"function coherently\".",
      "It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.",
      "The judges noted \"similar confusion and impracticability\" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.",
      "The judges added: \"The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.\"",
      "Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.",
      "However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs \"if it is proportionate to do so\".",
      "Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.",
      "He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.",
      "But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be \"settled\" by this court case.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.\"",
      "Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a \"reassessment\" of rules.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.",
      "For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.",
      "The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.",
      "Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was \"not limited to biological or birth sex\".",
      "The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.",

      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",
      "The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years.",
      "Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.",

      "How quickly are prices rising?",

    "summary": "There were scenes of jubilation for women's campaigners outside the Supreme Court as the ruling was read out.",
    "story": [
      "The UK Supreme Court has unanimously and unambiguously backed the argument that the definition of a woman in the Equality Act should be based on biological sex.",
      "Reading out the ruling, Lord Hodge cautioned that it should not be taken as a triumph for one group in society over another.",
      "But there were scenes of jubilation for women's campaigners outside the Supreme Court.",
      "Tearful hugs were exchanged and a bottle of champagne was cracked open.",
      "The fact someone had thought to bring one along underlines that it was potentially on the cards, but For Women Scotland (FWS) still seemed shocked by the scale of their victory.",
      "The Scottish government's argument - that sex can be changed via the gender recognition process, and that someone with a gender recognition certificate should have the protections of that sex - were dismissed.",
      "So what does it all mean?",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "UK Supreme Court rules legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex",
      "The application of the law on the ground, in \"real life\", was clearly foremost in the minds of the judges.",
      "Take the example of single sex spaces and services - part of the motivation for FWS bringing this case.",
      "The previous reading of the law was that everything from hospital wards and prison wings to support groups for victims of abuse can exclude everyone but women thanks to exceptions in the Equality Act.",
      "The concern from campaigners was that if people could change their sex with a certificate, and then claim protection against discrimination as a woman, that could be more complicated.",
      "That's particularly the case on a practical level, given those providing these services aren't actually meant to ask to see a gender recognition certificate.",
      "Now, the court is clear that this exemption can continue - the rules underpinning women-only spaces can exclude people with gender recognition certificates, along with everyone else.",
      "Does the Equality Act still protect trans people?",
      "There are still conditions which need to be satisfied - services will have to show that excluding trans people is a limited and proportionate means to achieving a legitimate aim.",
      "Blanket bans are generally discouraged. There is still a bar to clear to exclude anyone, and the test of proportionality has to be met in each case.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - which oversees the application of the Equality Act - is to issue new guidance to help service providers",
      "But FWS are clearly delighted with the underlying principle, and hope it will lead to clearer guidance for those providing services.",
      "It's important to note that trans people are still protected by the Equality Act.",
      "The protected characteristic of gender reassignment is not affected by this ruling, and Lord Hodge stressed that there are other defences against direct and indirect discrimination and harassment.",
      "He was clear that trans people are a \"vulnerable and often harassed minority\", who \"struggle against discrimination and prejudice as they seek to live their lives with dignity\".",
      "But the court has held that it would be problematic to effectively divide trans people between two different protected characteristics, depending on whether they have a certificate.",
      "Again, judges stressed that this is particularly the case when service providers can't ask to see the certificate.",
      "They say the law needs to be \"clear and consistent\" - and that including those with a GRC in with women would ultimately be \"incoherent\".",
      "The court carefully weighs the letter of the law, but it's worth remembering that ultimately that law is drafted by politicians - and it can be changed at the stroke of a pen.",
      "Will gender reform be relaunched at Holyrood?",
      "The issue may now move out of the legal arena and back into the political one.",
      "There had been some pressure on the UK government to clarify the definitions of the Equality Act, which is Westminster legislation.",
      "The court has handily done that for them, and UK ministers have welcomed the ruling.",
      "There may be more political pressure on the Scottish government, given it has lost this case.",
      "For a long time, ministers have batted away questions about this case - such as, do they really believe in the legal points their lawyers are making? - by saying they can't comment on live litigation.",
      "They will have to go into a little more detail now, but I imagine this is issue still just about the last thing they want to talk about.",
      "There had been some speculation that a ruling like this could raise the prospect of ministers re-launching their attempts at gender reform at Holyrood.",
      "But frankly there is not the political will in the John Swinney administration to ride into battle on this issue, as there was under his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "With a Holyrood election looming, there is no prospect of the first minister deciding to wade back into such a contentious debate.",
      "But with For Women Scotland now hoping to use this ruling to hold his feet to fire when it comes to broader government policies and guidance, it is one he will need to address."

    "summary": "British exports have been hit with tariffs by US despite having no trade deficit, but the UK may have some leverage.",
    "story": [
      "US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, suggesting it would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",
      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added.",
      "The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term \"deal\".",
      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",
      "This was meant to show that this \"deal\" was not about an extensive free trade agreement, covering nearly all goods.",
      "In Trump's first term, negotiations between the UK and US progressed fairly well up until the point controversial issues about medicine pricing and food standards emerged.",
      "Trump's team told me back then that they were waiting to see how close the UK would remain to European Union rules after Brexit.",
      "This time around, the \"deal\" seems to have been about science, technology and artificial intelligence cooperation in return for avoiding tariffs.",
      "The US has wanted to talk about the UK's \"tech tax\" on mainly US digital companies, and has raised issues about the Online Safety Act.",
      "However, there is a big problem now.",
      "The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of what it called its \"reciprocal tariffs\".",
      "But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.",
      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing.",
      "Ministers say they have secured the raw materials needed to keep the plant's blast furnaces working in the \"coming weeks\", while they look for a long-term solution.",
      "What is British Steel and why is it important?",
      "British Steel's Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to stop producing virgin steel, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it. The government views that as a risk to the UK's economic security.",

      "British Steel to get supplies to keep furnaces burning",
      "UK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",
      "Why is British Steel Chinese-owned?",
      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "But a delivery of the materials will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to Scunthorpe on Tuesday. A separate shipment of materials on its way to the UK from Australia.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC the costs would come from an existing \u00a32.5bn fund for steel.",
      "\"We are hoping as you know to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe but those conversations are ongoing,\" she added.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",

      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",
      "\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.",

      "Tall, with a solar panel mounted on top, the cameras are positioned high among barren and rugged mountains at nearly 3,000m (9,843ft).",
      "\"Snow leopard territory,\" says Asif Iqbal, a conservationist from WWF Pakistan. He walks us a few more steps and points to tracks on the ground: \"These are pretty new.\"",
      "Asif hopes this means the camera has recorded more evidence that the AI software - which allows it to differentiate between humans, other animals and snow leopards - is working.",
      "Trial and error",
      "The WWF is currently testing 10 cameras, deployed across three villages in Gilgit-Baltistan. It has taken three years to train the AI model to detect these categories with impressive - if not perfect - accuracy.",
      "Once we're back down the mountain, Asif pulls up his computer and shows me a dashboard. There I am, in a series of GIFs. It correctly detects I'm a human. But as we scroll down the list, I come up again, and this time I'm listed as both a human and an animal. I'm wearing a thick white fleece, so I forgive the programme.",
      "Then, Asif shows me the money shot. It's a snow leopard, recorded a few nights prior, in night-vision. He pulls up another one from the week before. It's a snow leopard raising its tail against a nearby rock. \"It's a mother leopard, looks like she's marking her territory,\" Asif says.",
      "Setting up the cameras in rocky, high-altitude areas took a lot of trial and error. The WWF went through several types of batteries until it found one that could withstand the harsh winters. A specific paint was chosen to avoid reflecting light as animals pass by.",
      "If the cellular service fails in the mountains, the device continues recording and capturing data locally. But the team has had to accept there are some problems they simply cannot solve.",
      "While the camera lens is protected by a metallic box, they've had to replace solar panels damaged by landslides.",
      "Doubt in the community",
      "It is not just the technology that has caused problems. Getting the local community's buy-in has also been a challenge. At first, some were suspicious and doubted whether the project could help them or the snow leopards.",
      "\"We noticed some of the wires had been cut,\" Asif says. \"People had thrown blankets over the cameras.\"",
      "The team also had to be mindful of the local culture and the emphasis on women's privacy. Cameras had to be moved because women were walking by too often.",
      "Some villages still have yet to sign consent and privacy forms, which means the technology cannot be rolled out in their area just yet. The WWF wants a binding promise that local farmers will not give poachers access to the footage.",
      "Sitara lost all six of her sheep in January. She says she had taken them to graze on land above her home but that a snow leopard attacked them.",
      "\"It was three to four years of hard work raising those animals, and it all ended in one day,\" she says.",
      "The loss of her livelihood left her bedridden for several days. When asked if she is hopeful the AI cameras could help in the future, she replies: \"My phone barely gets any service during the day, how can a text help?\"",
      "At a gathering of village elders, leaders of the Khyber village explain how attitudes have changed over the years, and that a growing proportion of their village understands the importance of snow leopards and their impact on the ecosystem.",
      "According to the WWF, snow leopards hunt ibex and blue sheep, which stops these animals from overgrazing and helps to preserve grasslands so villagers can feed their livestock.",
      "But not all are convinced. One local farmer questions the benefits of the animals.",
      "\"We used to have 40 to 50 sheep, now we've only got four or five, and the reason is the threat from snow leopards and from ibex eating the grass,\" he says.",
      "Climate change also has a part to play in why some feel threatened by snow leopards. Scientists say warming temperatures have led villagers to move their crops and livestock to higher areas in the mountains, encroaching on snow leopards' own habitat, making livestock more of a target.",
      "Whether the villagers are convinced by the conservation message or not, the WWF tells us legal penalties have served as a strong deterrent in recent years. Three men were jailed in 2020 after killing a snow leopard in Hoper valley, about a two-hour drive from Khyber. One of them had posted photos of himself with the dead animal on social media.",
      "While those involved in the camera project are hopeful their AI devices can have an impact, they know they cannot be the sole solution.",
      "In September, they are going to start trialling smells, sounds and lights at the camera sites to try to deter snow leopards from moving onto nearby villages, putting themselves and livestock in jeopardy.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:20:52 GMT",
    "summary": "A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.",
    "story": [
      "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.",
      "The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.",
      "There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.",
      "But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.",
      "These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.",
      "What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.",
      "To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".",
      "There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.",
      "It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.",
      "The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.",
      "SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.",
      "We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.",
      "He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.",
      "\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.",
      "The \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.",
      "\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"",
      "The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.",
      "The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it \u2013 to neutralise the acid that was added \u2013 and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.",
      "Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.",
      "There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air \u2013 but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.",
      "\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.",
      "\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"",
      "At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny \u2013 at most 100 metric tonnes per year \u2013 that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.",
      "In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.",
      "For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon \u2013 would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.",
      "\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.",
      "\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"",
      "The Seacure project has \u00a33m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.",
      "\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"",
      "'Some impact on environment'",
      "There's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.",
      "Guy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.",
      "\"Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,\" he says. \"So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.\"",
      "Hooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.",
      "\"It might be damaging but there might be ways to mitigate that \u2013 for example through pre-diluting the low-carbon water. It's important this is included in the discussion early on.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",
      "A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.",
      "This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
      "But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.",
      "The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "K2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.",
      "JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.",
      "The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.",
      "\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.",
      "\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"",
      "He told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.",
      "\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"",
      "Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".",
      "He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"",
      "The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans",
      "There are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.",
      "Firstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery.",
      "For that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result.",
      "These latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.",
      "But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.",
      "\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"",
      "That view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.",
      "\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.",
      "Suggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"",
      "He said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".",
      "Other research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.",
      "The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below.",
      "But it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.",
      "\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.",
      "\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"",
      "Dr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface.",
      "Both these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, compounding the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.",
      "Prof Chris Lintott, presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night, said he had \"great admiration\" for Prof Madhusudhan's team, but was treating the research with caution.",
      "\"I think we've got to be very careful about claiming that this is 'a moment' on the search to life. We've [had] such moments before,\" he told Today.",
      "He said the research should be seen instead as \"part of a huge effort to try and understand what's out there in the cosmos\".",
      "Prof Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.",
      "\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

      "The Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland explosively erupted on14 April sending a huge ash cloud into the atmosphere and the weather pattern directed it towards Europe.",

      "It feels hard to imagine now what it was like having eight days of airspace closure across the UK and Europe in 2010 with 300 airports closed, 100,000 flights cancelled, 10 million passengers unable to travel and a reported \u00a31.1 billion loss for the airline industry.",
      "Flights were grounded for eight days in mid-April 2010 with a major impact on passengers in the UK and around the world",
      "'Black Swan Event'",
      "The day after the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption which spewed ash high into the atmosphere - around 20 to 50,000ft (4-10 miles) where commercial airlines operate - that ash started to drift southward into UK airspace.",
      "International aviation rules at the time were that aircraft could not fly into any levels of volcanic ash and the airspace was quickly closed down.",
      "This had never caused a problem before because most volcanic eruptions up to that point were localised and airlines were able to fly around ash cloud without issue.",
      "According to Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA): \"It was what a lot of people called a 'Black Swan Event' - unforeseen, typically with extreme consequences - but it was a Black Swan that was ultimately predictable because Icelandic volcanoes happened and will continue to happen.\"",

      "\"An eye opener globally\"",
      "The Met Office operates one of nine global Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAAC) and is responsible for issuing advisories for volcanic eruptions originating from the north eastern corner of the North Atlantic, including Iceland.",
      "Once Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted the centre ran computer models with forecast data and for Dr Matthew Hort, Head of Atmospheric Dispersion at the Met Office, it was the most intense period of his working life before and since.",
      "He said: \"It was an eye opener globally. The unique thing about the Icelandic eruption was that it happened in an area where we had winds from the north that brought the ash down across UK airspace and trans-Atlantic routes.\"",
      "Four days after the main eruption the Met Office dispersion forecasts showed ash across the UK, the Atlantic, most of Europe and western Russia.",
      "As the days of disruption went on with no sign of ash contamination clearing, everyone was under pressure to find a way to re-open airspace in a safe and controlled way.",
      "Airlines and engine manufacturers had to conduct research to ascertain if there was a safe level of ash concentration which wouldn't damage jet engines.",
      "Rolls-Royce was at the forefront of pioneering testing and for the first time was able to establish a level of volcanic ash that didn't seriously affect the jet engine over a given timeframe.",
      "Mr Nicholson explained: \"In conjunction with Met Office forecasts it enabled us to open airspace where there were low levels of ash.\"",
      "On 20 April after an international teleconference headed by the CAA, it was agreed that 2 milligrams of ash per cubic metre of air was an acceptable safe ash concentration.",
      "Airspace re-opened that night with flights operating as normal.",
      "Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull continued to erupt well into June with occasional spikes of higher ash concentration coming into the UK but under the new rules authorities were able to keep most of the airspace open with only localised airport closures.",
      "Airlines had a 'zero volcanic ash' policy for jet engines in 2010",
      "Have things changed?",
      "In the months and years after research and working groups continued to assess procedures and rules.",
      "\"The work that happened very quickly at the time around the event got us to 90% of where we are now\u2026but that has been consolidated and put into specific safety measures,\" Mr Nicholson said.",
      "Today there are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage.",
      "\"If something similar happened today, it will be up to the airlines to use their own permissions from the engine manufacturers and their own safety cases to decide where and when, based on forecasts, will allow them to go,\" Mr Nicholson added.",
      "\"And that will be different for each airline as some may accept higher or lower levels of ash as acceptable.\"",
      "There has also been a massive development programme in the monitoring and forecasting of volcanic ash.",
      "As a direct result of the ash cloud the Met Office deployed permanent LIDAR instruments that point a laser into the sky capable of measuring ash concentrations.",
      "New satellites have also been launched globally which enable scientists to monitor ash concentrations every 15 minutes.",
      "In addition there have been advances in computer modelling to improve the physics and processes involved in how different shapes and sizes of volcanic ash behave in the atmosphere.",
      "Volcano has been erupting intermittendly near Grindavik, Icleand with large lava flows but no ash cloud",
      "Could it happen again?",
      "What is clear today is that as a direct result of 2010, with all the improvements made, the UK and Europe is in a much better place to control and manage volcanic ash.",
      "In recent months there have been small eruptions in Iceland leading to the evacuation of Grindavik and the closure of the famous Blue Lagoon spa.",
      "However, there has been little concern to aviation as these recent eruptions are mostly small fissure eruptions with large and slow lava flows - rather than the explosive ash eruption from Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.",
      "Experts believe that if the 2010 volcanic ash event happened today there would be \"nowhere near the same level, if any, disruption\" according to both Dr Hort and Mr Nicholson, largely because we now know that the level of ash seen in UK airspace in 2010 was relatively low and safe to fly in.",
      "But Dr Hort warns: \"You can always have a bigger eruption.\"",
      "If a volcano erupted with really high levels of ash affecting UK or European airspace, then \"absolutely we will see disruption because it's a safety issue\", added  Mr Nicholson.",

      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

      "Two years ago she was living her dream, running two successful businesses helped by her explosion in popularity during the Covid lockdowns.",
      "But the physiotherapist went silent on Instagram in 2023 when a popular gossip podcast shared a story about a man who had allegedly cheated on his well-known fianc\u00e9e - with enough clues to suggest the man in question was her then partner.",

      "Lilly - who has not discussed what happened in public until now - sat down with me to talk about the moment which changed her future.",
      "Soon after the podcast launched, her social media feeds began to fill with what she called \"investigator-style\" videos speculating about her life and how she would react.",

    "summary": "China sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it. Can they break up?",
    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "And illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.",
      "\"I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,\" she said.",
      "\"With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.\"",
      "Pot Noodles in the Large Hadron Collider",
      "Back in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI.",
      "\"I don't necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:42:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Led by Jensen Huang, dubbed the 'Taylor Swift of tech', the chip giant has become pivotal in the race for AI supremacy.",
    "story": [
      "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.",
      "On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.",
      "The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".",
      "But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?",
      "What is Nvidia?",
      "Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.",
      "In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.",
      "Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.",
      "Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.",
      "Why is Trump targeting Nvidia's H20 chips?",
      "US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.",
      "In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.",
      "A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.",
      "However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.",
      "DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.",
      "Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.",
      "Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.",
      "Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.",
      "Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.",
      "\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.",
      "Why is Nvidia's CEO in China?",
      "China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.",
      "The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.",
      "In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.",
      "On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.",
      "Separately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that \"China's market investment and consumption potential is huge\", according to state news agency Xinhua.",
      "During talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.",
      "How will the export controls impact US-China competition?",
      "The controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.",
      "Nvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.",
      "And in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.",
      "Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between \"two systems\", one dominated by the US and the other by China.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:39:32 GMT",
    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed on 23 March after a convoy of PRCS ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck came under fire by the Israeli military.",
      "In a statement, the IDF said its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces.",
      "The IDF said its investigation found six of the casualties were Hamas members, and rejected that there had been summary executions.",
      "In an on-the-record briefing, Major General Yoav Har-Even - who investigated the incident - told journalists that the Israeli military maintained that six of the emergency workers were Hamas operatives and said they would later be named.",
      "The report said the incident took place in what it called a \"hostile and dangerous combat zone\", and that the commander on the ground perceived an immediate and tangible threat after vehicles approached rapidly.",
      "It blamed \"poor night visibility\", which the IDF said meant the commander did not identify the vehicles as ambulances.",
      "Another commanding officer \"will receive a reprimand\" for \"his overall responsibility for the incident\", the report added.",
      "Journalists invited to Sunday's military briefing were shown aerial footage, shot in the early hours of 23 March, which showed the attacks. The footage also showed several other vehicles, including an ambulance, passed by in the hour or so between the first and second Israeli attack, without being shot at.",
      "Israeli officials said this proved troops in Gaza did not open fire on medical vehicles unless they felt threatened.",

      "\"Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all, eroding.\"",

      "But it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing.",

      "The video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.",
      "It also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform.",
      "The bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.",
      "The IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident. They did not confirm his name, but the International Committee of the Red Cross has previously named him as Assad al-Nassasra.",
      "The Red Crescent and several other international organisations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident.",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican has named 167 people who died in the 2019 Easter bombings in Sri Lanka as \"heroes of faith\".",
      "The country's cardinal, Malcolm Ranjith, made the announcement at an event to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the suicide attacks which targeted Catholic churches and five star hotels during Easter Sunday mass, killing 269 people.",
      "Those recognised by the Vatican were Catholic faithful attending mass at the churches that were attacked.",
      "The bombings shook the country, which had not seen such levels of violence since the end of a civil war in 2009. However, since then investigations into the attacks have been controversial.",
      "Muslim extremists claimed the attacks, but there has been public criticism from families of the victims and from the island's minority Christian community, who accuse the government of dragging their feet in taking action against those suspected of carrying out the bombings.",
      "Anger grew as information emerged that intelligence warnings about the attacks were not acted upon by security heads or the government of the time. The country's Supreme Court has since directed then president Maithripala Sirisena to pay compensation to the victims of the bombings for \"ignoring actionable intelligence\" that could have prevented the attacks.",
      "A trial was opened against 25 people accused of masterminding the attacks in 2021. However, with 23,000 charges filed against the men, lawyers involved in the case warned that the sheer number of charges and staggering witness list could mean the trial dragging on for years.",
      "The Catholic community led by Cardinal Ranjith has repeatedly alleged that the government at the time covered up investigations \"to protect the brains behind the attacks\".",
      "A 2023 investigation by Channel 4, which raised questions about links between the government, military and the group blamed for the attacks, also prompted public anger. It alleged that the attacks were allowed to happen for political power.",
      "Presidential elections held soon after the attacks saw Gotabaya Rajapaksa sweep to power, after campaigning on a national security platform.",
      "He made a statement in parliament denying all the allegations raised in the documentary.",
      "The issue gained new currency when Sri Lanka elected a new president and parliament in 2024. The newly-elected government has since alleged that the attacks were a conspiracy by a \"certain group\" to seize political power at the time.",
      "They have also reopened investigations into the attacks, with a report of a presidential inquiry commission officially handed over to the country's central investigative agency for further inquiry.",
      "\"As a government, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that justice is served. Ongoing efforts to investigate the attacks and uncover all truths without obstruction or delay remain a top priority. Accountability, transparency, and genuine justice are essential to honouring the memory of the victims and restoring public trust,\" Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya said in a statement to mark the anniversary."

    "story": [
      "The Democratic Republic of Congo has banned the party of former President Joseph Kabila, accusing him of links to the M23 rebel group which has seized large parts of the east of the country this year.",
      "The ban comes amid reports that Kabila has returned to the country after spending two years in South Africa.",
      "He is said to have returned to the town of Goma, which was seized by the Rwandan-backed M23 in January.",
      "Kabila led DR Congo for 18 years, after succeeding his father Laurent, who was shot dead in 2001. Joseph Kabila was just 29 at the time.",
      "An interior ministry statement said all activities of Kabila's PPRD party had been banned because of its \"ambiguous attitude\" to the occupation of Congolese territory by the M23.",
      "It also noted that Kabila had chosen to return to Goma, where he was being protected by the \"enemy\".",
      "The PPRD has not commented.",
      "On Friday, the government accused Kabila, 53, of high treason and ordered the seizure of all his property.",
      "Kabila has previously denied having links to the M23. He has not commented on the latest moves by the Congolese government, or confirmed that he has returned to DR Congo.",
      "However, he did say earlier this month that he would be going back to the country. Senior PPRD officials have denied that Kabila is currently in Goma.",
      "On Saturday, his spokesperson Barbara Nzimbi posted on X that Kabila would be addressing the nation in the coming hours or days.",

      "After being sworn in as president following his father's death, he twice won elections. His second and final elected term in office officially ended in December 2016, but he refused to step down, saying it wasn't possible to organise elections, leading to deadly protests.",
      "He stayed in power for two more years until elections were finally held in 2018.",
      "In January 2019, he handed power to F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, the official winner of a disputed election, which many election observers said was rightfully won by Martin Fayulu.",
      "He accused Kabila and Tshisekedi of agreeing a deal to exclude him from power - something both men have denied.",
      "But relations between the pair worsened and their parties' coalition was formally ended in December 2020.",
      "Kabila left DR Congo in 2023, officially to study in South Africa.",
      "In January 2024, his doctoral thesis on the geopolitics of African relations with the US, China and Russia was validated at the University of Johannesburg.",
      "Why has Kabila returned?",
      "In a written statement to announce his forthcoming return, Kabila said it was motivated by a desire to help resolve the worsening institutional and security crisis in DR Congo.",
      "He also told the French-language magazine Jeune Afrique he wanted to \"play a role in seeking a solution after six years of complete retreat and one year in exile\".",
      "But Ben Radley, a political economist and lecturer in international development at Bath University, noted that the leader of the political grouping which includes the M23, Corneille Nangaa, was the head of the electoral commission under Kabila and had been a \"close ally\".",
      "\"In addition, the historical continuity with his father Laurent Kabila, who also entered Congo from the east in the late 1990s in his eventual march to the presidency, is also on the minds of many Congolese,\" he told the BBC.",

    "story": [
      "Russia's ceasefire in Ukraine lasted only 30 hours, and even then it appears to have been very limited in scope, with accusations of violations on both sides.",
      "Kyiv said there had been no \"air raids alerts\" on Sunday during Vladimir Putin's \"Easter truce\" and President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested this could be the \"easiest\" format to extend for 30 days and possibly more.",
      "The US had tried to organise a 30-day ceasefire but that never took hold, and this latest chapter underscores the difficulty in achieving even a brief pause in fighting,",
      "Russia insisted on a number of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters as well as \"underlying causes of the conflict\".",
      "One major factor hampering the talks' progress is the long history of broken ceasefire deals, resulting in deep mistrust between the two neighbours.",
      "During his tempestuous meeting with Donald Trump in February, Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014, and argued that no such deal would hold without security guarantees.",
      "In turn, Russia accuses the Ukrainian president of being \"incapable\" of implementing any such agreements.",
      "Independent experts say Russia bears the brunt of the blame for broken truces, even though Ukraine bears some responsibility, too.",
      "Statements by current and former Russian officials also indicate that Moscow would be prepared to cease hostilities, only if its original objectives are achieved - namely a demilitarised, neutral and non-nuclear Ukraine.",
      "Mistrust dates back to Russia's 2014 invasion",
      "By invading Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the two countries signed in 1997. Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\".",
      "The war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning.",
      "Gen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014.",
      "As a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed.",
      "Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?",
      "Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?",
      "Minsk agreements signed and broken",
      "The first major ceasefire agreement, signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too.",
      "This prompted the second attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter.",
      "Within minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them.",
      "What followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force.",
      "They included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others.",
      "A \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year.",
      "Who is to blame?",
      "Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith.",
      "\"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says.",
      "Because of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC.",
      "\"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\"",
      "John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine.",
      "Verifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.",
      "BBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals.",
      "\"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says.",
      "Despite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal.",
      "Zelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion.",
      "Putin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states.",
      "What next?",
      "Putin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\".",
      "So far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine.",
      "Trump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.",
      "Russia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means.",
      "Vladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition.",
      "The very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\"."

      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",
      "\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.",
      "She's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.",
      "In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.",

      "\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.",
      "But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.",
      "The couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.",

      "Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"",
      "Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"",
      "Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.",
      "\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.",

      "Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.",
      "In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.",

    "title": "Could AI text alerts help save snow leopards from extinction?",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 23:36:09 GMT",
    "summary": "In Pakistan, it's hoped newly-developed AI cameras could warn villagers via text to move their livestock if snow leopards enter the area.",
    "story": [
      "Snow leopards cannot growl. So when we step towards one of these fierce predators, she's purring.",
      "\"Lovely,\" as she's called, was orphaned and rescued 12 years ago in Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan.",
      "After years of relying on staff to feed her, she does not know how to hunt in the wild - and cannot be set free.",
      "\"If we release her, she would just go attack a farmer's sheep and get killed,\" Lovely's caretaker, Tehzeeb Hussain, tells us.",
      "Despite laws protecting them, between 221 to 450 snow leopards are killed each year, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says, which has contributed to a 20% decline in the global population over the past two decades.",
      "More than half of these deaths were in retaliation for the loss of livestock.",
      "Now, scientists estimate that just 4,000 to 6,000 snow leopards are left in the wild - with roughly 300 of these in Pakistan, the third-largest population in the world.",
      "To try and reverse these worrying trends, the WWF - with the help of Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) - has developed cameras powered by artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "Their aim is to detect a snow leopard's presence and warn villagers via text message to move their livestock to safety.",
      "Tall, with a solar panel mounted on top, the cameras are positioned high among barren and rugged mountains at nearly 3,000m (9,843ft).",
      "\"Snow leopard territory,\" says Asif Iqbal, a conservationist from WWF Pakistan. He walks us a few more steps and points to tracks on the ground: \"These are pretty new.\"",
      "Asif hopes this means the camera has recorded more evidence that the AI software - which allows it to differentiate between humans, other animals and snow leopards - is working.",
      "Trial and error",
      "The WWF is currently testing 10 cameras, deployed across three villages in Gilgit-Baltistan. It has taken three years to train the AI model to detect these categories with impressive - if not perfect - accuracy.",
      "Once we're back down the mountain, Asif pulls up his computer and shows me a dashboard. There I am, in a series of GIFs. It correctly detects I'm a human. But as we scroll down the list, I come up again, and this time I'm listed as both a human and an animal. I'm wearing a thick white fleece, so I forgive the programme.",
      "Then, Asif shows me the money shot. It's a snow leopard, recorded a few nights prior, in night-vision. He pulls up another one from the week before. It's a snow leopard raising its tail against a nearby rock. \"It's a mother leopard, looks like she's marking her territory,\" Asif says.",
      "Setting up the cameras in rocky, high-altitude areas took a lot of trial and error. The WWF went through several types of batteries until it found one that could withstand the harsh winters. A specific paint was chosen to avoid reflecting light as animals pass by.",
      "If the cellular service fails in the mountains, the device continues recording and capturing data locally. But the team has had to accept there are some problems they simply cannot solve.",
      "While the camera lens is protected by a metallic box, they've had to replace solar panels damaged by landslides.",
      "Doubt in the community",
      "It is not just the technology that has caused problems. Getting the local community's buy-in has also been a challenge. At first, some were suspicious and doubted whether the project could help them or the snow leopards.",
      "\"We noticed some of the wires had been cut,\" Asif says. \"People had thrown blankets over the cameras.\"",
      "The team also had to be mindful of the local culture and the emphasis on women's privacy. Cameras had to be moved because women were walking by too often.",
      "Some villages still have yet to sign consent and privacy forms, which means the technology cannot be rolled out in their area just yet. The WWF wants a binding promise that local farmers will not give poachers access to the footage.",
      "Sitara lost all six of her sheep in January. She says she had taken them to graze on land above her home but that a snow leopard attacked them.",
      "\"It was three to four years of hard work raising those animals, and it all ended in one day,\" she says.",
      "The loss of her livelihood left her bedridden for several days. When asked if she is hopeful the AI cameras could help in the future, she replies: \"My phone barely gets any service during the day, how can a text help?\"",
      "At a gathering of village elders, leaders of the Khyber village explain how attitudes have changed over the years, and that a growing proportion of their village understands the importance of snow leopards and their impact on the ecosystem.",
      "According to the WWF, snow leopards hunt ibex and blue sheep, which stops these animals from overgrazing and helps to preserve grasslands so villagers can feed their livestock.",
      "But not all are convinced. One local farmer questions the benefits of the animals.",
      "\"We used to have 40 to 50 sheep, now we've only got four or five, and the reason is the threat from snow leopards and from ibex eating the grass,\" he says.",
      "Climate change also has a part to play in why some feel threatened by snow leopards. Scientists say warming temperatures have led villagers to move their crops and livestock to higher areas in the mountains, encroaching on snow leopards' own habitat, making livestock more of a target.",
      "Whether the villagers are convinced by the conservation message or not, the WWF tells us legal penalties have served as a strong deterrent in recent years. Three men were jailed in 2020 after killing a snow leopard in Hoper valley, about a two-hour drive from Khyber. One of them had posted photos of himself with the dead animal on social media.",
      "While those involved in the camera project are hopeful their AI devices can have an impact, they know they cannot be the sole solution.",
      "In September, they are going to start trialling smells, sounds and lights at the camera sites to try to deter snow leopards from moving onto nearby villages, putting themselves and livestock in jeopardy.",
      "Their work tracking these \"ghosts of the mountains\" is not over yet.",

    "title": "A death every three minutes: Why India's roads are among the world's deadliest",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g49pgx6d0o",
    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:15:29 GMT",
    "summary": "India's roads claimed over 172,000 lives in 2023 - averaging 474 deaths daily, or one every three minutes.",
    "story": [
      "Every morning, India's newspapers are filled with reports of road accidents - passenger buses plunging into mountain gorges, drunk drivers mowing down pedestrians, cars crashing into stationary trucks and two-wheelers being knocked down by larger vehicles.",
      "These daily tragedies underscore a silent crisis: in 2023 alone, more than 172,000 people lost their lives on Indian roads, averaging 474 deaths each day or nearly one every three minutes.",
      "Although the official crash report for 2023 has yet to be released, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari cited the data to paint a grim picture at a road safety event in December.",
      "Among the dead that year were 10,000 children. Accidents near schools and colleges accounted for another 10,000 fatalities, while 35,000 pedestrians lost their lives. Two-wheeler riders also bore the brunt of fatalities. Over-speeding typically emerged as the single biggest cause.",
      "A lack of basic safety precautions also proved deadly: 54,000 people died due to not wearing helmets and 16,000 from not wearing seatbelts.",
      "Other major causes included overloading, which led to 12,000 deaths, and driving without a valid licence, which factored in 34,000 crashes. Driving on the wrong side also contributed to fatalities.",
      "In 2021, 13% of accidents involved drivers with a learner permit or no valid licence. Many vehicles on the road are old and missing basic safety features like seatbelts - let alone airbags.",
      "This hazardous road environment is further complicated by India's chaotic traffic mix.",
      "A bewildering array of users crowds India's roads. There are motorised vehicles like cars, buses and motorcycles vying for space with non-motorised transport such as bicycles, cycle rickshaws and handcarts, animal-drawn carts, pedestrians and stray animals. Hawkers encroach upon roads and footpaths to sell their wares, forcing pedestrians onto busy roads and further complicating traffic flow.",
      "Despite efforts and investments, India's roads remain among the most unsafe in the world. Experts say this is a crisis rooted not just in infrastructure, but in human behaviour, enforcement gaps and systemic neglect. \u200bRoad crashes impose a significant economic burden, costing India 3% of its annual GDP.",
      "India has the world's second-largest road network, spanning 6.6m kilometres (4.1m miles), just after the US. National and state highways together make up about 5% of the total network, while other roads - including gleaming access-controlled expressways - account for the rest. There are an estimated 350 million registered vehicles.",
      "Gadkari told the road safety meeting that many road accidents happen because people lack respect and fear for the law.",
      "\"There are several reasons for accidents, but the biggest is human behaviour,\" he said.",
      "Yet that's only part of the picture. Just last month, Gadkari pointed to poor civil engineering practices - flawed road design, substandard construction and weak management - along with inadequate signage and markings, as key contributors to the alarmingly high road accident rate.",
      "\"The most important culprits are civil engineers... Even small things like the road signages and marking system are very poor in the country,\" he said.",
      "\u200bSince 2019, his ministry reported 59 major deficiencies in national highways, including cave-ins, Gadkari told the parliament last month. Of the 13,795 identified accident-prone \"black spots\", only 5,036 have undergone long-term rectification.",
      "Over the years, road safety audits, conducted by the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Centre (TRIPP) at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, have uncovered serious flaws in India's road infrastructure.",
      "Take crash barriers. These are meant to safely stop vehicles that stray off the road - without flipping them over. But in many places, they're doing the opposite.",
      "Despite clear standards for height, spacing and installation, on-ground reality often tells a different story: the metal barriers at the wrong height, mounted on concrete bases, or poorly placed. These flaws can cause a vehicle, especially a truck or bus, to flip over instead of being safely stopped.",
      "\"Unless installed exactly as specified, crash barriers can do more harm than good,\"  Geetam Tiwari, emeritus professor of civil engineering at IIT Delhi, told the BBC.",
      "Then there are the tall medians - or road dividers, as they are locally called. On high-speed roads, medians are supposed to gently separate traffic moving in the opposite direction. They shouldn't be taller than 10cm (3.9in) but, audits show, many are.",
      "When a high-speed vehicle's tyre hits a vertical median, it generates heat, risks a tyre burst, or even lifts the vehicle off the ground - leading to dangerous rollovers. Many medians in India are simply not designed keeping this threat in mind.",
      "A stretch of a highway near the capital, Delhi, stands as a stark example - a road slicing through dense settlements on both sides without safety measures to protect residents. Throngs of people precariously stand on the medians as high-speed traffic whizzes by.",
      "And then there are the raised carriageways. On many rural roads, repeated resurfacing has left the main road towering six to eight inches above the shoulder.",
      "That sudden drop can be deadly - especially if a driver swerves to avoid an obstacle. Two-wheelers are most at risk, but even cars can skid, tip, or flip. With every layer added, the danger just keeps rising, experts say.",
      "Clearly, India's road design standards are solid on paper - but poorly enforced on the ground.",
      "\"One key issue is that non-compliance with safety standards attracts minimal penalties. Contracts often don't clearly spell out these requirements, and payments are typically linked to kilometres constructed - not to adherence to safety norms,\" says Prof Tiwari.",
      "Minister Gadkari recently announced an ambitious plan to upgrade 25,000km of two-lane highways to four lanes. \"It will help reduce accidents on the roads significantly,\" he said.",
      "Experts like Kavi Bhalla of the University of Chicago are sceptical. Mr Bhalla, who has worked on road safety in low and middle-income countries, argues that India's road designs often mimic Western models, ignoring the country's unique traffic and infrastructure needs.",
      "\"There is no reason to believe that road widening will lead to fewer traffic deaths. There is a lot of evidence that road upgradation in India results in higher traffic speeds, which is lethal to pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists,\" he says.",
      "\"A key issue is that new roads in India simply copy road designs used in the US and Europe, where the traffic environment is very different. India is trying to build US-style highway infrastructure but not investing in US-style highway safety engineering research and crash data systems,\" Mr Bhalla adds.",
      "To tackle the escalating road safety crisis, the government is \"implementing\" the \"5Es\" strategy: engineering of roads, engineering of vehicles, education, enforcement and emergency care, says KK Kapila of the International Road Federation. (\u200bAccording to a report by the Law Commission of India, timely emergency medical care could have saved 50% of road crash fatalities.)",
      "Mr Kapila is helping the federal government with a road safety plan. He says seven key states were asked to identify their most accident-prone stretches. After implementing targeted interventions based on the 5Es framework, these stretches \"have become the safest\" in their states, he told me.",
      "Most economists agree building more roads is key to India's growth, but it must be sustainable and not take priority over the lives of pedestrians and cyclists.",
      "\"The price of development shouldn't be borne by the poorest segments of society.   The only way to learn how to build such roads is to try to do interventions, evaluate if they improved safety and, if they didn't help, modify them and evaluate again,\" says Mr Bhalla. If that doesn't happen, roads will only get smoother, cars faster - and more people will die.",

      "I am the very model of a modern Major-General,I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historicalFrom Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical",
      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",

      "Martindale's professional career began when he was just 17, according to his Hollywood Walk of Fame biography. The Jackson, Tennessee, man worked as a disc jockey for several years and even had his rendition of the spoken-word song \"Deck Of Cards\" chart on the Billboard Hot 100.",

    "summary": "Some employees working on the CDC's measles response were warned they could face layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year's record outbreak of the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said.",
      "CDC officials had initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas \u2014 onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus \u2013 to other kinds of facilities like schools as well.",
      "\"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News.",
      "Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, which was largely eliminated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month.",
      "He spoke with CBS News as a member of the labor union American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, which represents NIOSH employees in Ohio that were impacted by Kennedy's layoffs.",
      "Two experts from NIOSH \u2014 Neu and an industrial hygienist \u2014 were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said.",
      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",
      "An official said Tuesday that the CDC was now \"scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support\" to Texas and other states now facing outbreaks.",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",

      "Hall said he had also been blocked from presenting his research on ultra-processed foods at a conference and given an ultimatum to either comply with edits demanded by officials on a manuscript he had worked on with outside scientists or remove himself as a co-author.",
      "\"I was hoping this was an aberration. So, weeks ago I wrote to my agency's leadership expressing my concerns and requested time to discuss these issues, but I never received a response,\" he said in his post.",

      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrived in India on Monday for a four-day visit as New Delhi looks to avoid U.S. tariffs, negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Washington and strengthen ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Vance will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the first day of his largely personal visit. The two leaders are expected to hold discussions on bilateral ties outlined in February when Modi met President Trump in Washington.",
      "The U.S. is India's largest trading partner and the two countries are now holding negotiations aimed at sealing a bilateral trade agreement this year.",
      "Shortly after his arrival in New Delhi, word came that Pope Francis had died. Vance had met with Francis in Rome on Easter Sunday.",
      "Vance posted his condolences on X, saying,\"My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.   I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful.    May God rest his soul.\"",
      "Modi, whose country has nearly 30 million Christians who make up 2.3% of the population, says Francis will always be remembered \"as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world.",
      "\"From a young age, he devoted himself towards realizing the ideals of Lord Christ. He diligently served the poor and downtrodden. For those who were suffering, he ignited a spirit of hope,\" Modi said.",
      "The Indian leader posted a photo of himself with the pope and said he was \"greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development.\"",
      "They've set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well.",
      "Vance's first visit to New Delhi comes amid the backdrop of Mr. Trump's now-paused tariff program against most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi's main rival in the region.",
      "Modi and Vance are expected to \"review the progress in bilateral relations\" and \"exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest,\" India's Foreign Ministry said last week.",
      "\"We are very positive that the visit will give a further boost to our bilateral ties,\" spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.",
      "Vance was greeted with an Indian classical dance performance after he arrived at New Delhi's Palam airport on Monday, following his visit to Rome. He is accompanied by his wife, Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India, along with their children and officials from the U.S. administration.",
      "The couple and their three young children visited the Akshardham Hindu temple in New Delhi after their arrival and are expected to tour the iconic Taj Mahal monument and the 12th-century Amer Fort - a UNESCO world heritage site - during their trip.",
      "Why U.S.-India ties matter",
      "India is a close partner of the U.S. and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "It's also part of \"the Quad,\" which is comprised of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China's expansion in the region. Mr. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year.",
      "Modi established a good working relationship with Mr. Trump during his first term in office and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries.",
      "He was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Mr. Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration's demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S.",
      "Regardless, Mr. Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a \"tariff abuser\" and \"tariff king.\"",
      "The trade negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump and his team are studying whether firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is an option, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.",
      "Though appointed by the president and approved by Congress, the Federal Reserve chair is an independent\u00a0role. Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017 and was renominated to serve another 4-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "\"The President and his team will continue to study that matter,\" Hassett said when asked during a press gaggle on Friday if removing Powell from his post was likely.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday took aim at Powell\u00a0in a social media post, writing that the Fed should be cutting interest rates, and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "In a speech delivered on Wednesday, Powell\u00a0warned\u00a0that the Trump administration's trade war could result in a combination of higher inflation and slower growth. That economic mix describes stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that characterizes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "On Wednesday, Powell also reiterated that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now, also sparking pushback from Mr. Trump.",
      "\"He's too late. Always too late. A little slow and I'm not happy with him. I let him know it and \u2014 if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday at the White House.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose board members could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that presidents may not legally fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "But Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, reported Reuters on Wednesday. And in March, the White House dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "Even if Mr. Trump were able to remove Powell, it's not clear that doing so would change the direction of the central bank's decisions on interest rates. Those calls are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC \u2014 a 12-member group tasked with setting monetary policy \u2014 and not at Powell's discretion.",
      "Who would replace Powell?",
      "Fed governor Kevin Warsh, 55, is a former Morgan Stanley executive who was nominated to the Fed's board of governors by President George W. Bush.",
      "Mr. Trump is considering selecting Warsh as Powell's replacement, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0on Thursday. However, Warsh has advised Mr. Trump to allow Powell to remain through the end of his term, the publication added.",
      "Widely respected, Warsh is considered to be even more hawkish \u2014 or willing to allow interest rates to remain high to control inflation \u2014 than Powell, according to a January blog post\u00a0by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.",

    "summary": "President Trump has suggested stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, a step that experts say would be unusual and face  legal challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The battle between President Trump and Harvard University has moved to a new front, with the IRS now considering whether to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status.",
      "A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesday\u00a0suggested that Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS.",
      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",
      "But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said.",
      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",
      "Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations.",
      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

    "summary": "A new study from SmartAsset reveals varied increases in grocery prices depending on where you live.",
    "story": [
      "As ongoing inflation continues to deplete household budgets, perhaps nowhere is the pinch felt more strongly\u00a0than in grocery aisles. However, depending on where you live, the pain can be sharper than in other areas.",
      "That's according to a new study from\u00a0SmartAsset\u00a0which reveals notable fluctuations in grocery price increases from city to city. The financial technology company used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine how the costs of everyday items like eggs, meat and produce have changed in 12 major metro areas over the last year.",
      "\"While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before \u2014 tripling the general rate of inflation,\" the study found.",
      "Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis and author of the SmartAsset study, said the big takeaway is how much location can impact these day-to-day items.",
      "\"We really wanted to do was compare where people's budget is going to get hit the hardest,\" said DeJohn, who noted that the study in not a comprehensive ranking but a snapshot of location-related shifts in the cost of groceries. \"People are noticing these costs, and they're impacting their bottom line.\"",
      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by the Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"",
      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\"",
      "Meloni and Trump seem to \"get along great\"",
      "Meloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Meloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"",
      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",
      "After her brief visit to Washington the Italian leader will return home, where she's expected to meet on Friday with Vice President JD Vance during his visit to the Italian capital and the Vatican.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

      "Shein and Temu, two popular Chinese e-commerce sites known for their low-cost items, say they will raise prices for U.S. consumers starting next week, a move that comes amid President Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China and the end of a trade loophole.",
      "The sites are popular with U.S. shoppers because of their low prices, with a focus on fast fashion. While they predominantly sell women's apparel and accessories, both also sell men's and children's clothing. Temu carries household items and small personal electronics.",

      "Beginning April 25, though, the deals won't be as enticing for U.S. consumers. In a notice on its website, Shein told customers that \"price adjustments\" will go into effect late next week. Shein said \"recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\" have caused its own costs to rise, making the price hikes necessary.",
      "\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience and stay true to our mission: making fashion accessible for everyone,\" Shein added, without indicating the size of the price hikes.",

      "The \"de minimis\" loophole",
      "The two e-commerce sites have benefitted from a tax law loophole known as the \"de minimis\" exemption, which has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",
      "In an April 2 executive order, the White House said that shippers in China have previously used the exemption to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order said.",
      "Effective May 2, such shipments will be subject to \"all applicable duties,\" the order states.",
      "The end of the \"de minimis\" loophole, as well as the Trump administration's tariffs of 145% on imports from China, have dented the business models of the two platforms.",
      "The changes come at a time when American shoppers have increasingly flocked to the low-cost retailers. The number of de minimis parcels shipped to the U.S. has surged to more than 1 billion in 2023, up from 153 million in 2015, with China accounting for the largest volume of shipments, according to a January Congressional Research Service report.

      "Beth Benike, cofounder of Busy Baby, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of U.S. tariffs poses serious problems for the Oronoco, Minnesota-based retailer.",
      "\"I am a problem solver. When a decision or policy comes out, I'll find a solution. I will work with it or around it,\" said Benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. \"The next day, the policy changes and that plan doesn't make sense anymore, so I come up with something else.\"",
      "Smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from China, which now faces U.S. tariffs of as high as 145%, are among the most concerned about Mr. Trump's trade policies. But a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business.",
      "Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies.",
      "\"Just as it did during President Trump's first term, the administration's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of American energy will restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by Mr. Trump's tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence\u00a0gauge.",
      "\"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\" William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.",
      "The decline in optimism comes as Mr. Trump's economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. They understand if\u00a0prices rise, their real spending power will go down,\" Steven J. Davis, a Stanford University economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty\u00a0index, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending.\"",
      "The cost of unpredictability",
      "To be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. But risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable.",
      "\"Uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship,\" Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the rules of the game are constantly shifting \u2014 one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you don't have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability \u2014 businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth.\"",
      "Smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added.",
      "Davis, whose own\u00a0index\u00a0shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are \"the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring.\"",
      "\"When you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business,\" Karra added.",
      "Busy Baby's Benike said the sudden swerves in U.S. trade policy have made planning all but impossible.",
      "\"If I invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, I am already invested, the wheels are in motion and I'd be screwed,\" she said.",
      "\"I can't make a decision, so the best thing I can do is get the inventory I've paid for here and ready to sell,\" she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a Chinese warehouse.",
      "Meanwhile, the new 125% U.S. baseline tariff on Chinese imports means that Benike would owe $229,000 in duties on products worth roughly $158,000. She has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs.",
      "Her plan B, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in China and to sell them to markets outside the U.S.",
      "\"There are babies everywhere. If I can't sell in America, there are other countries that are interested,\" she said.",
      "Business on the brink",
      "Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Anthropologie, said the sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports \"wipe out our business completely\" if they stay in place.",
      "\"We have not imported anything yet with the 145% tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy,\" she said.",
      "Another challenge is that U.S. factories aren't equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, Bear said. And because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by May, it's too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries.",
      "Said Bear, noting that she can't afford to lose a whole season's worth of orders, equivalent to roughly $500,000 in sales: \"If tariffs are still in place when it's time to import them, we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company.\"",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech today that President Trump's tariffs are likely to boost U.S. inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

      "Reaching the six-figure salary threshold may be considered a financial victory for many Americans, but in a many big U.S. cities the once aspirational milestone just doesn't cut it anymore.",
      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there. The fact that you can make six figures in many, many cities across this country and still be broke, even before you factor in debt payments, is scary,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree and author of the study. \"That's the reality for many families today, though, and unfortunately, there's not much reason to think things are going to improve anytime soon. That means that families are going to be forced to make some tough decisions and real sacrifices to get by.\"",
      "The study comes at a time when consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest levels since the pandemic, as Americans weather a period of economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's tariff rollout. Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "Read on to see how your city ranked.",
      "Where is it hardest to get by on $100,000?",
      "In San Jose, the heart of California's pricey Silicon Valley, a family of three with household income of $100,000 a year would find themselves more than $2,000 short every month after covering basic expenses. Researchers say this is attributable to disproportionately high housing and transportation costs. Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",
      "Notably, the lion's share of locations where family breadwinners making $100,000 might still end up broke were cities on the West or East Coasts. California metro hubs figured prominently on the list, with all 10 of the state's largest cities among the top 25.\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York also had multiple metro areas included on the list.",
      "Which cities were the most affordable for a family making $100,000?",
      "In 1 in 3 cities, however, a $100,000 salary \"is still magical,\" even for a family of three. Earners in these areas could still pocket $1,000 or more each month after paying basic expenses, LendingTree found.",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the U.S. - Mexico border, came in at the top for places where a $100,000 salary will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Residents there would have $1,770 left over after subtracting money for their monthly expenditures. Close behind McAllen are Little Rock, Arkansas and El Paso, Texas, according to the report.",
      "For those facing stubborn costs of living, LendingTree says there are still ways to\u00a0mitigate the impact\u00a0whether it's by staying in your rental longer or reducing the interest rate you're paying.",

That matches the level of tariffs that President Trump has placed on Chinese imports, although those taxes can rise as high as 145% for some products.

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in federal court for a second day in a landmark federal antitrust trial accusing Meta of being a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:21:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Filing a tax extension is easy. But it's important to know what you're getting into, including what to do if you owe money to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off.",
      "Normally, the IRS recommends\u00a0that people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, a\u00a0tax extension\u00a0gives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty.",
      "As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes, according\u00a0to the IRS. The tax agency said\u00a0in January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.",
      "Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an April TaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected.",
      "If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind.",
      "What is the 2025 filing deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions.",
      "U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns.",
      "This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for 13 states due to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file.",
      "How do I file a tax extension online?",
      "The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. The online payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension.",
      "Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension while using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software.",
      "Another option is to file a Form 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS.",
      "If I get an extension, does that mean I have more time to pay the IRS?",
      "Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRS says, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.",
      "Is there a penalty for filing taxes late?",
      "Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%.",
      "What happens if I file but don't pay?",
      "The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline.",
      "Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to a\u00a0reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says.",
      "What if I can't afford to pay the IRS?",
      "The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on the IRS website.",

      "Vance will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the first day of his largely personal visit. The two leaders are expected to hold discussions on bilateral ties outlined in February when Modi met President Trump in Washington.",
      "The U.S. is India's largest trading partner and the two countries are now holding negotiations aimed at sealing a bilateral trade agreement this year.",
      "Shortly after his arrival in New Delhi, word came that Pope Francis had died. Vance had met with Francis in Rome on Easter Sunday.",
      "Vance posted his condolences on X, saying,\"My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.   I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful.    May God rest his soul.\"",
      "Modi, whose country has nearly 30 million Christians who make up 2.3% of the population, says Francis will always be remembered \"as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world.",
      "\"From a young age, he devoted himself towards realizing the ideals of Lord Christ. He diligently served the poor and downtrodden. For those who were suffering, he ignited a spirit of hope,\" Modi said.",
      "The Indian leader posted a photo of himself with the pope and said he was \"greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development.\"",
      "They've set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well.",
      "Vance's first visit to New Delhi comes amid the backdrop of Mr. Trump's now-paused tariff program against most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi's main rival in the region.",
      "Modi and Vance are expected to \"review the progress in bilateral relations\" and \"exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest,\" India's Foreign Ministry said last week.",
      "\"We are very positive that the visit will give a further boost to our bilateral ties,\" spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.",
      "Vance was greeted with an Indian classical dance performance after he arrived at New Delhi's Palam airport on Monday, following his visit to Rome. He is accompanied by his wife, Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India, along with their children and officials from the U.S. administration.",
      "The couple and their three young children visited the Akshardham Hindu temple in New Delhi after their arrival and are expected to tour the iconic Taj Mahal monument and the 12th-century Amer Fort - a UNESCO world heritage site - during their trip.",
      "Why U.S.-India ties matter",
      "India is a close partner of the U.S. and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "It's also part of \"the Quad,\" which is comprised of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China's expansion in the region. Mr. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year.",
      "Modi established a good working relationship with Mr. Trump during his first term in office and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries.",
      "He was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Mr. Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration's demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S.",
      "Regardless, Mr. Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a \"tariff abuser\" and \"tariff king.\"",
      "The trade negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law.",
      "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
      "The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.",
      "\"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Thomas, that \"the court hastily and prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief.\" He argued that the high court's intervention was inappropriate because it was unclear that the court had jurisdiction and that there was \"little concrete support\" for the allegation that the migrants were in imminent danger of removal. He also noted that the Supreme Court heard only from the ACLU, and not the government, before acting.",
      "\"In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,\" Alito wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\"",
      "\"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said.",
      "\"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post.",
      "On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.",
      "The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.",
      "The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law.",
      "Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly.",
      "\"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act in March\u00a0to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0New York and southern Texas\u00a0promptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.",
      "But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.",
      "Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.",
      "But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.",
      "An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said.",
      "Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.",
      "With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday.",
      "\"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\"",
      "Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed\u00a0criminal contempt\u00a0by ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court.

    "summary": "Sen. Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Sunday that El Salvador \"tried really hard\" to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, before the government reversed course late last week.",
      "\"I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day,\" Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia is a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who was sent last month to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison as part of a White House effort, although the administration later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly among those deported. The case has come to the fore in recent weeks amid simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia on Thursday after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
      "Van Hollen noted that he held press conferences in El Salvador, where he made the point that the government was \"violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him,\" adding that \"they realized that was a bad look.\"",
      "After Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele was the first to announce the meeting, writing in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was \"now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,\" alongside photos that showed the two men sitting at a table with drinks that resemble margaritas. The president later wrote, \"I love chess.\"",
      "Van Hollen said of the Salvadoran government, \"they go to great lengths to deceive people,\" outlining how drinks were brought to the table as photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, adding that \"no one touched them.\"",
      "\"The reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged,\" Van Hollen said. \"They're trying to create the impression that, you know, this is a guy in paradise, when in fact he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. When he was released from immigration custody, an immigration judge granted him withholding of removal \u2014\u00a0 a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "Van Hollen said Sunday that Abrego Garcia has since been transferred from CECOT to a facility in Santa Ana.",
      "In an update to the federal district court in Maryland, a top State Department official noted Sunday that Abrego Garcia told the senator he had been transferred to Centro Industrial about eight days before their meeting.",
      "\"Abrego Garc\u00eda told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,\" Michael Kozak said in the court filing.",
      "Trump administration officials have since acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Still, a fierce legal battle has ensued around efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The administration was ordered earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, before the Supreme Court ruled that the judge's decision properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release, while the scope should be clarified. On Thursday, a federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause the district judge's order, writing that the government's assertions in the case should be \"shocking\" to all Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House and Bukele have made clear that they don't intend to bring Abrego Garcia back, despite the orders, while Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the gang MS-13. Van Hollen stressed that the administration hasn't presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or other terrorist activity, while urging officials to \"put up or shut up in court.\"",
      "\"Go to court, stop tweeting, and put up or shut up in front of the judges,\" Van Hollen added.",
      "The Maryland Democrat said he did not travel to El Salvador to litigate the details of Abrego Garcia's case, but rather \"to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health.\" But he argued that the case is also much bigger than one man.",
      "\"This is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected, because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man \u2014 as the courts have all said is happening in this case \u2014 you threaten the constitutional rights of every American,\" Van Hollen said.",

    "story": [
      "After nearly 11 hours of debate, the Texas House approved early Thursday a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition.",
      "The school choice bill was passed in an 85-63 vote \u2013 two were absent. The measure will provide taxpayer-funded education savings accounts, also known as school vouchers, allowing students in public schools to attend private institutions if accepted into the state's program.",
      "Eligibility for Texas school vouchers and funds allocation",
      "Under the bill,\u00a0students will receive $10,000 each year\u00a0if they attend a private school. Disabled students would receive up to $30,000 a year and home-schooled students would get $2,000.",
      "\"This is an extraordinary victory for the thousands of parents who have advocated for more choices when it comes to the education of their children\u2026I applaud the legislators who took a stand with the overwhelming majority of Texans who support school choice,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.",
      "Abbott and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows have said for months that they have more than the 76 votes required to pass the bill.",
      "\"Today marks a historic chapter for education in our state, with the Texas House passing its landmark 'Texas Two Step' proposals to deliver more education opportunities for students alongside the largest-ever increase in public school funding,\" Burrows said.",
      "The vote marks the first time since 1957 that the Texas House has approved legislation making state money available for families to use on their children's private schooling, according to the Texas Tribune.",
      "The vote took place just after 2 a.m. Thursday, after the Texas House heard 43 amendment proposals to the bill. All proposed amendments were tabled. The vote was divided between Democrats and Republicans. Out of all the votes, two Republicans joined all Democrats to vote against the bill.",
      "\"Welfare for the rich\"",
      "Texas Democrats expressed disappointment about the outcome, calling it \"welfare for the rich.\" Democrats also expressed concern that the program will hurt school districts by taking money away from them.",
      "Most state Republicans supported the legislation.",
      "\"Working families are going to be the ones who will foot the bill for this voucher scam,\" said Texas Democrats Chair Kendall Scudder. \"We're deeply disappointed in the lawmakers who chose to fall in line instead of standing up for their communities.\"",
      "The House will take a final vote later on Thursday. The bill will then go to the Texas Senate, where lawmakers will decide whether to go along with the House's changes or make their own changes.",
      "Trump weighs in",
      "Ahead of the vote, Abbott said that President Trump supported school choice as well.",
      "\"[Trump] called this morning to share his support for the Texas House passing SB 2 today,\" Abbott posted on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on social media on Thursday congratulating his \"friends\" Abbott, Burrows and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick \"along with Texas Legislators for finally passing SCHOOL CHOICE, which I strongly endorsed.\"",
      "\"This is a gigantic Victory for students and parents in the Great State of Texas!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"We will very soon be sending Education BACK TO ALL THE STATES, where it belongs. It is our goal to bring Education in the United States to the highest level, one that it has never attained before.\"",
      "HB 2: Public school funding bill",
      "On Wednesday, the Texas House passed HB 2, the public school funding bill. It passed 144-4, with two absent. Republican leaders said it represents the largest increase in funding for public schools.",
      "\"Texas public schools are the backbone of our communities, and today the House delivered a historic investment to bolster public education for the next generation,\" Burrows said Wednesday. \"House Bill 2 lays the foundation for a modernized, responsive school finance system that will grow with the needs of Texas students while targeting taxpayer dollars where they'll make the greatest impact for students and teachers.",
      "Under this bill's proposals and others, the House will inject $9 billion in new money. That includes raising the basic allotment to school districts by $395. Forty percent of the new funding will go toward teacher pay raises and salary increases for other staff. The basic allotment would increase every two years.",
      "Democrats have said the state doesn't spend enough money on public education when compared to other states. Republicans, though, said they have continued to spend more money on schools.",
      "As lawmakers debate the bills, various local school districts across North Texas have passed deficit budgets because of record inflation and after Republican lawmakers left $4.5 billion for schools on the sidelines. The districts have also faced declining student enrollment, which has cost them funding as well.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Britan Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war yesterday, the largest such swap since Russia launched its invasion more than three years ago. But despite hopes that a brief Easter truce might open the door to lasting peace, both Kyiv and Moscow are accusing each other of breaking the ceasefire. Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick is just back from a trip to Ukraine's front line, and he joins us this morning from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Congressman, thank you for being here.",
      "REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Good morning, Weijia. Happy Easter.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Happy Easter to you too. So just hours ago, you landed from that visit to Ukraine, and you had a chance to sit down with President Zelenskyy. Did you talk about the status of the peace agreement that the US is trying to broker?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: We sure did. We spent a lot of time with them, one-on-one. President Zelenskyy and I have spoken many times. I consider him a friend now and a great leader. And yes, we talked at length about a whole host of topics. We didn't leave really anything out of the discussion. And obviously, that day, he was signing a Memorandum of Understanding on a minerals agreement, which they've gone back and forth on. You know, he and I had talks about the security guarantees. That's obviously a big concern of his. He is rightfully concerned. The history is with the Budapest Memorandum. When Ukraine was the third largest possessor nuclear weapons, they gave them up voluntarily, based on a memorandum- also a memorandum in 1994 that said that they would get security guarantees for- in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal. As it turns out, that that promise was not kept by none other than Russia, right? Go figure. So he has justifiable concerns, but we talked through that because we do want this economic partnership to be the precursor to security guarantees.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And just a quick follow on that Congressman the President indicated in the Oval Office on Thursday that that deal would be signed next week. Do you know if that's true?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, that remains to be seen, and it depends on what's in the deal. So what President Zelensky made clear to me, as he has many times, is, you know, certain agreements can be signed by his finance minister and Secretary Bessent, but if it's worded differently, if there are specific numbers, for example, that's something that needs to go through his parliament and potentially our Congress, if it's fashion in terms of a treaty. So a lot of it's going to depend on the details and what is actually in it, in terms of what's required for approval.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG : Okay. So we'll wait- wait to see that. You just talked about all the frustration that Zelenskyy continues to express, and he did so with regard to this Easter ceasefire. If these two countries can't even get through a holiday ceasefire, how realistic is a 30-day-pause, not to mention the end of a war anytime soon?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: That is entirely up to Vladimir Putin. The man has never kept his word, ever in any context, as far as I'm aware. So we have to know what we're dealing with our government, I hope knows who they're dealing with, with Vladimir Putin. He's not a man of his word. He's not interested in peace. I hope he gets there. He is not all that different, Weijia, from the schoolyard bully. If you look at Russia, right? Obviously, it's huge geographically, but a population of about 150 million people, about half the size of the United States, 1/5 the size of Europe, a total GDP of $2 trillion. That's the GDP of the state of Texas. So they are large, but they're weak, and they're proving that weakness by the fact that they can't even successfully prosecute a war against a much weaker neighbor. So we got to stop, you know, being fearful or bowing down to Russia. We need to stand up to Russia. We need to defend Ukraine, support Ukraine, and if it's done the right way, this will end positively. It's all about peace through strength. There's peace through strength and there's war through weakness. There's no magical third option.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio have said that the US has to figure out if a deal is doable in a matter of days, or just move on. And on Friday, I asked President Trump about this fresh sense of urgency. Here's what he said.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: What do you need to see from both sides in order to keep negotiations going? What do you want to see from Russia and Ukraine?",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I have to see- my whole life has been one big negotiation, and I know when people are playing us, and I know when they're not. And I have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: How much of this demand, Congressman for enthusiasm, do you think it's a direct message to Russia, and how much time do these two sides have to get something done?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I hope it's directed to Russia. I think it is directed to Russia. I can tell you, President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian people. I know them well, Weijia. I have lived there as an FBI agent. I was assigned there as a- working Russian counterintelligence. They want peace. They're a peaceful nation. There are democratically elected- elected officials, including President Zelenskyy. They want peace. They did not ask for this invasion. They did not provoke this invasion. They were invaded by Vladimir Putin, who had been telegraphing this punch for years. We all knew what he was intending to do, and now he's doing it. He views the fall of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical disaster of our lifetimes, and he's trying to reconstitute it. Step one is Ukraine. We cannot allow him to do that, and what we also can't allow is for the precedent being set here that dictators are going to be rewarded for violating the territorial borders and territorial sovereignty of their neighbors. We cannot reward that. So, you know, I- I want to say this too. I think Secretary Rubio is doing a great job. He's a smart man. He understands Putin, he understands the dynamic of the- of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the history there, and I have full faith in his ability to barter a just and fair agreement. But it's important to remember, and this applies to all agreements where we facilitate as a nation, that it's ultimately up to the nations to accept and abide by those conditions. President Zelensky, the Ukrainian people desperately want peace. They've always wanted peace. They were a peaceful nation before Russia wrongfully invaded them, and they want to get it back, but it's got to be a just and lasting peace.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And very quickly, Congressman, because we have to let you go soon. But if these talks fail, the President was ambiguous about whether the Administration would continue to support Ukraine, and Speaker Johnson has earlier said that there was no appetite for additional aid. So will there be a new bill on the House floor, quickly?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I don't want to get ahead of the administration or the Speaker, but I will just leave it at this. I will do everything in my power to make sure that Ukraine wins this fight and that Russia loses, and that we have a peaceful settlement. If you look at every time the Ukraine support has been put on the House floor, overwhelming support.",

      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah. Thank you for having me, Weijia.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to talk about President Trump's tariffs plan, because last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said tariff increases were higher than expected, and the economic effects will be too, including higher inflation and slower growth. Do you agree with that assessment?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Well, look, I'm out here. The Chicago Fed district is kind of the heart of the Midwest, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan. Folks, when I'm out talking to them, business people and civic leaders have been saying for months that they had anxiety that if the tariffs were going to be as big as- as what- what they were saying they might be in February, March, that that would have a pretty significant impact on their operations. The tariff announcement, April 2, was definitely bigger than- than what- what they had been expressing, but there's just a lot of question marks. We don't know 90 days from now, when, when they've revisited the tariffs, we just don't know how big they're going to be.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Yeah, and the administration says they have a lot of deals in the works, so we have to wait to see what those look like. Trump's former top economic adviser Gary Cohn, was on CNBC talking about what he is hearing from business executives about how they are impacting consumers right now. I want to play that- some of that for you.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "GARY COHN: What everyone's worried about is June, July and August. Are we just pulling all this demand forward from the summer? Because people that were going to buy stuff naturally through the next six months are saying, Look, I'm going to save the tariff. I'm going to buy it now.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: So, he's talking about people trying to get ahead of the tariffs in case no deals are reached in case those high numbers do get put into effect. So I wonder if you're hearing the same from your contacts in Chicago that people are trying to rush out there to buy, and how does that impact your outlook for the economy?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah, that kind of preemptive purchasing is probably even more pronounced on the business side, where in anticipation, a lot of the imports that the tariffs would apply to, especially in the auto sector, are things that are parts, components, supplies that go into the manufacturing of other products. So we heard a lot about preemptive building up of inventories that could last 60 days, 90 days, if there were going to be more uncertainty. That raises the possibility that that Gary Cohn raised there, that activity might look artificially high in the initial and then by the summer, might fall off, because people had bought it all and brought it forward. I'm still hopeful, and the people that I talked to out in the Midwest are still hopeful that on the back end of this, it would be more like what Secretary Besent said, that this could be a spark to lead to a new he called it golden age of global trade. If we can get through this, it's important to remember the hard data coming into April was pretty good, the unemployment rate around steady, full employment, inflation coming down. It's just a desire of people expressing they don't want to go back to kind of 21 and 22 at a time when inflation was- was really raging out of control.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Got it. I do want to go back to Jay Powell's remarks about the impact of tariffs, or potential impact, because they prompted President Trump to lash out by declaring \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\" Here's what the President said when reporters pressed if he has the power to remove Powell.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I'm not happy with him. I let him know it, and if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Now, Austan, I know the Fed does not wade into politics, and I'm not going to ask you to do that, but I wonder if statements like this undermine or complicate your job as an apolitical institution?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Look, I'm glad you didn't ask me for legal advice, because I have an econ PhD. Don't ever ask legal advice from somebody like me. I would say, monetary independence- before I was ever at the Fed, I was a research economist at the University of Chicago. There's virtual unanimity among economists that monetary independence from political interference, that the Fed or any central bank be able to do the job that it needs to do, is really important. And they came to that not as a theory, but just by looking around the world at places where they don't have monetary independence. And the fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse. So we really- I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that- that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: All right, Austan, thank you so much for your time, and Happy Easter to you.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We go now to Massachusetts, Democratic governor Maura Healey, who joins us this morning from just outside of Boston. Governor Healy, good morning to you.",
      "GOV. MAURA HEALEY: Good morning Weijia. Happy Easter to you and to all out there listening.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Happy Easter to you as well. I want to start with Harvard University, which is, of course, in your state and your alma mater. Last week, the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in multi-year grants, $60 million in multi-year contracts to Harvard, and that's after the university rejected some of the administration's demands in order to keep that money flowing. We saw the impact was swift, everything from research to staffing. And I wonder, is the university going to be able to withstand this funding freeze?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Well, here's what's- here's what's happening on the ground as a result of those actions. And really, let's go back six weeks when the first cuts were announced for NIH funding. Massachusetts, we've got a number of colleges and universities, research institutions. These are entities that actually have pioneered for decades. Cures to diseases, cancer, working right now on treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and so much more. In addition, they've often been the ones that have been leading the research when it comes to our defense industry. I could go through the various sectors, but basically what Donald Trump is doing by cutting off this funding, a few things are happening. Research labs are shutting down, scientists and researchers are leading the United States and going to other countries to do their work. And essentially, Donald Trump is giving away intellectual assets. The other thing that's happening real time right now, and it's incredibly sad, Weijia, I was in a hospital here just the other week, and this is a Hospital Boston Children's, where some of the sickest kids in the country go for care. And there have been cuts to Boston Children's and other hospitals as a result of Donald Trump's actions, because these are part of a teaching hospital system. These cuts to universities have significant ripple effects, because they result in people being laid off, scientists being laid off, doctors being laid off, clinical trials for things like cancer treatments have been shut down, and this is really bad. It's bad for patients, it's bad for science, and it's really bad for American competitiveness. As Governor, I want Massachusetts soaring. I want America soaring. And what Donald Trump is doing is basically saying to China and other company- other countries, come to the United States, take- take our scientists, take our researchers and that, and that's what's happening, and it's really it's terrible, on top of what he's done to the economy, and in just dismantling and wrecking the economy right now, I'm working hard every day to lower costs in my state, cut taxes, build more housing, and Donald Trump is just making life more expensive for all of us, making life harder for all of us, and by coming after colleges and universities Weijia, this is really going to have an impact on American competitiveness. There's a reason this country has led the world, remember, and it's because we've invested in science and innovation for decades.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Has Harvard asked your state for any support?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: There is no way a state can begin to make up for the cuts to federal funding, the cuts that Donald Trump has made to education, to health care, food for kids, heating assistance for seniors. He just cut off FEMA disaster relief for our states the other day, and as governor, I'm going to do everything I can to protect my residents, to protect our state, to protect our economy, but he makes it really difficult. I'll give you an example, Weijia. I filed and signed the largest housing bill in history. I want to build more housing so that we can drive down costs. Donald Trump comes in with tariffs. Where do we get our lumber from? Canada. Where do we get other building materials from? Mexico. He's just made everything more expensive and more difficult, and states will do the best they can. Governors like myself will do the best that we can, but there's no way that states can begin to make up for, or course correct these failings by the President of the United States and his administration when it comes to managing the economy.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump is also calling for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, and CBS News has confirmed that the IRS is considering at least rescinding it. Are you aware of any evidence that the university has done anything to merit that?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Absolutely not. It's outrageous, but it's part of this continued playbook that Donald Trump has been using, which is to silence critics, right? First, he went after the law firms. Then he went after companies. Then he went after everyday Americans. Now he's going after colleges and universities, using any and all tactics to try to shut them down, to silence them. That's what Donald Trump is about. There's no merit to any of this. And of course, it's illegal. You can't do that as President of the United States, and that will get tested in court. Of course, Donald Trump, right now is ignoring court orders, which is another issue, but there's absolutely no basis. And you know what he is saying in doing that is he's saying to every not for profit out there, not just colleges and universities, but think of all the organizations out there that are nonprofits in your community, right? Supporting your little league, supporting seniors, any number of organizations, tens of thousands across the United States, Donald Trump is saying, I can take that away from you right now, because I'm President and I have that power. He does not have that power. And there is no- not only is there no legal basis for what he is trying to do it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And Governor, I want to ask you about a Tufts student, Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained in your state by plainclothes officers late last month. Right now, she's being held at a detention facility in Louisiana and has not been charged with any crimes. Late on Friday, a judge ordered ICE to move her to Vermont by May 1, so she can attend the district court proceedings over her detention. Have you talked to her family or lawyers, and is there anything your state can do to support her right now?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Well, this is a very troubling matter, because this woman is a Fulbright Scholar. She's getting her PhD in child development. She has no criminal record or history. It appears she was one of many signers of an op-ed in a college newspaper. The courts are already involved here, but it's very concerning. It's very concerning because there appears to be a total ignoring of due process, which is so foundational to our democracy and our rule of law in this country, and it also sends such a chill to students everywhere, including foreign students. Massachusetts is a place where we benefit from foreign students coming from all over the world to do research, to study and to start companies, in addition to winning Nobel Prizes. And this is really important, because when I- when I talk about Donald Trump's failed America first agenda, we show this is what I'm talking about--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: -- Governor, thank you so much--",
      "GOV. MAURA HEALEY: -- They're not going to go to the United States. They're going to go elsewhere--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: -- Thank you so much there, I'm sorry we have to leave it there--",
      "GOV. MAURA HEALEY: -- We need to do better--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: -- but I appreciate you so much this Sunday to share some of your time with us. Thank you, Governor. And we'll be right back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with EPA administrator Lee Zeldin that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. Administrator Zeldin, thank you so much for spending some of your morning with us. I want to start with what your office called the most momentous day in the history of the EPA, and that is when the EPA announced 31 deregulatory actions just last month. That's a long list, but some of the things that stood out are, you're reconsidering regulations on power plants, on mercury and air Toxic Standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The mission statement of the EPA is to protect human health and the environment. Can you assure the American public that all this deregulation is not going to have an adverse impact on people and the environment?",
      "EPA ADMINISTRATOR LEE ZELDIN: Absolutely, we have to both protect the environment and grow the economy. It's what the American people demanding- demanding of us. They want us to make sure that we are applying common sense. Over the course of the last couple years of the Biden administration, there were a lot of regulations that were brought over the finish line that were targeting entire industries. And when the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet. That includes the cost of being able to heat their home. The choice of whether or not to be able to heat their home or fill up their fridge with groceries or afford prescription medication. The ability to get jobs. What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well. So going into this process, I don't prejudge outcomes- \u00a0not allowed to under the Administrative Procedures Act. We will have a process that includes public comment, and we would encourage the public to weigh in when they have that opportunity.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Last month, you also announced that your agency is proposing changing the Waters of the U.S., and of course, those are subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act and historically set standards that the EPA can address pollutants in our drinking water, including forever chemicals known as PFAS. I bring that up because during your time as a congressman, you advocated for legislation to address those dangerous PFAS in our water. Can you talk about the specifics of what waters could be now excluded from EPA regulation and why?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: Okay, so the first thing on the \"Waters of the U.S.\", the United States Supreme Court, in a decision called Sackett, put out prescriptive language saying what should be considered a water of the U.S., and what we're going to do is get the federal regulation in line with the Supreme Court decision that came out right now. Across the country, the map of 50 states are operating under different definitions of what is a water of the US. And there are farmers and ranchers and other landowners that and they don't know whether or not water on their land is a water of the US. They have to go hire an attorney or someone else to tell them whether or not they have waters on their property. So on that front, we want a simple definition for the entire country, so that people understand whether or not there's a water of the U.S. on their property. It's also important to some governments that weighed in as well, with regards to PFAS, very important issue, and we have to ensure that we are tackling it. I was a member of the PFAS task force when I was a member of Congress. I represent in the district with a bunch of PFAS issues. I've heard some feedback from members of Congress as it relates to PFAS. One example is that there are compliance states coming up where there are local water municipalities that are saying that they're going to have trouble meeting those particular deadlines, and they're looking for assistance. So I've heard that from members of Congress. Now, that feedback from members of Congress, it's important, something else they talk about is called passive receivers. So a local water municipality would have to pay for the PFAS cleanup, and then they pass it off to their consumer. And that is against the principle of polluter pays. Instead of making Americans pay to clean up PFAS from their own drinking water, the responsible party should be paying, and in many cases, the responsible party is the federal government.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to turn to also the $20 billion worth of clean energy grants that you terminated because just last week, a federal judge ruled that the government must unfreeze that money because the administration did not offer sufficient evidence for waste, fraud and abuse. Now the ruling has been stayed while the appellate court looks into the case further. But can you talk about what this judge has says is a lack of evidence. Because there are several ongoing investigations to look for that waste, fraud and abuse, but they haven't concluded. So why did you freeze the money before those investigations wrapped?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: And I'm glad you pointed out that the circuit court then stopped what the district court was saying. So, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, lack of sufficient EPA oversight, these were all concerns that we had. First were- had the alarm raised when a Biden EPA political appointee in December was on video saying that they were tossing gold bars off the Titanic, rushing to get billions of dollars out the door before Inauguration Day. And also said, with an eye towards getting themselves jobs at recipient NGOs. So for example, as it relates to unqualified recipients, there was one recipient NGO that only received $100 in 2023, they got $2 billion in 2024. They also have in their grant agreement requirement to complete a training in 90 days called \"how to develop a budget.\" They were amending the account control agreements days before the inauguration, reducing EPA oversight. There's all sorts of questions that you can ask me as relates to where this money goes, because the $20 billion goes through eight pass through entities, EPA isn't even a party to the account control agreements once it goes to the other entities, including many other pass throughs. If you ask me, what happens to that money, basic questions, $20 billion, I couldn't even provide answers to you. Now, I owe it to you, to the American public, to Congress, to be able to tell them where that money goes. The idea that we're going to play along with tossing gold bars off the Titanic is something that I will not go along with. I have a zero tolerance for any waste and abuse. It is my duty to ensure that I'm an exceptional steward of tax dollars. It is my responsibility to make- make sure we have more oversight of those funds.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You bring up the gold bars because of that Project Veritas video where one former EPA advisor used that phrase, but you're not banking all of these cuts based on that one assertion, are you?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: So it's interesting because, you know, you asked me, I brought up one- one exact- piece of example as it relates to that video. I talk about unqualified recipients. I talk about an NGO that's brand new that received $100 and they get 2 billion. I talk about how their grant agreement tells them that they have 90 days to complete training called \"How to develop a budget.\" I talk about how they're amending account control agreements just days before the election--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And the judge says that's not sufficient evidence.",
      "LEE ZELDIN: Oh no, it's actually worse than that. In the judge's opinion, she doesn't even reference it. She ignores it. Now this is one of the problems with district court judges across this entire country. They were not elected President of the United States. It is important for us to be able to fulfill our constitutional duties, to follow our statutory obligations, and it is important to be a responsible steward of tax dollars. But what shouldn't happen is ignore all of the evidence and then just say, there is no evidence. The 39-page opinion of the district court doesn't even reference any of that. And if we had more time and you said, hey Lee, why don't you provide for me 15 more examples of evidence right now, and it's up to you. I don't know how much time you have. But I could just keep going of all the evidence and talk about self dealing, conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients and reduced oversight.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Administrator, I will get that from your team, and I appreciate it. We will also be watching that case as it unfolds closely. Thank you so much, and Happy Easter to you.",
      "LEE ZELDIN: Thank you.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And we turn now to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Senator, thank you so much for joining us this morning. You're just back from El Salvador, and I want to pick up where we left off with Camilo, because the White House is using these new details to build its case that Abrego Garcia should stay where he is and not come back to the U.S. Your response?",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, Weijia it's good to be with you and these- his case is, of course, separate than the case of the Venezuelans that you were talking about earlier.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Yes.",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: And in Abrego Garcia's case, the Trump administration admitted in federal court that he'd been wrongfully abducted and sent to a prison in El Salvador. But rather than fixing the problem, as the Supreme Court has said, in terms of his need to be- use their efforts to to facilitate his release, they reprimanded the lawyer who made that case. So, they need to bring him home. Now, with respect to these other facts. I say, put up or shut up in court, as you just heard in your last conversation, they have not done that and I do want to just read one sentence from the federal district court who said, and I quote, \"that the administration has presented no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13, or to any other terrorist activity,\" unquote. Go to court, stop tweeting and put up or shut up in front of the judges.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You bring that up because that is why the administration says that they have deported Abrego Garcia. And you have previously said that when you talk to him, he was not informed about why he was deported or detained. Did you tell him why the administration says they did what they did?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I did not go over all the facts of his case, other than to say that the courts of the United States had determined that he had been wrongfully detained and deported. He has no news of his case. He did tell me that when he was taken to the Baltimore detention facility, he wanted to make one phone call to let people know exactly what was happening in terms of his detention there, and he was not able to make it. He did not know at that time that they were going to send him back to El Salvador, where, as you say, a federal immigration judge had- had prohibited, prohibited the administration from sending him.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You also said that you did not directly ask Abrego Garcia whether he is a member of MS-13, which, of course, the Trump administration has designated as a terrorist group. I wonder why because that is all we are hearing from the White House and you know, he hasn't been able to speak for himself. So did you ask him?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I know his answer. His answer he has made repeatedly, including in court, which is that he is not. I was not there to litigate all the details of his case. I was there to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health. That's what I promised his wife and family that I would try to do, and that is what I did.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Since he was deported, there have been a lot of questions about his welfare and where exactly he is and you broke the news that he is no longer at CECOT, the maximum security prison, but rather transferred. Do you know why he was transferred and how long he'll stay at this less restrictive prison?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I don't know why he was transferred. I mean, CECOT was a traumatizing experience, as was being sort of abducted from the United States illegally, without knowing why. He did say that he felt threatened by other prisoners at CECOT, not those who were in his immediate cell, but taunts from others. So he is now at a place in Santa Ana, and I believe I was the first to learn that he had been transferred.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to show our viewers some pictures that the president of El Salvador, Bukele, showing you and Abrego Garcia sitting around what appears to be margaritas. You have blamed him for trying to deceive people with props. After he posted those images, he also posted, quote, \"I love chess.\" Do you have any concerns that the Salvadoran government used you as a pawn to make their point that Abrego Garcia is doing well and that he should stay where he is?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, in fact, the El Salvadoran government tried really hard not to let me see him, but I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day. I had press conferences in El Salvador with local press and made the point that El Salvador was violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him, not his wife, not his lawyers, nobody. They realized that was a bad look. So I'm glad I met him, that was the purpose of my visit. They go to great lengths to deceive people, and that's what you saw, because they got these government guys, essentially told the waiters to bring these drinks that appear to look like margaritas to the table. No one touched them. I can go into the details about how their whole scheme was set up, but the reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down, and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged. They're trying to create the impression that you know this is a guy in paradise when, in fact, he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, the Trump administration has made abundantly clear that they have no intention of bringing him back to the United States. And in fact, the- the official White House account posted a picture that says exactly that based on their own edits. Is it fair to say that Abrego Garcia will remain in El Salvador as long as Trump is president, or unless Trump changes his mind?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, because the Supreme Court of the United States and the other courts have said that the administration has to facilitate his return. As of right now, they are in defiance of that court order. They're not doing anything. I want to be really clear, this is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected. Because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man, as the courts have all said is happening in this case, you threaten the constitutional rights of every American. I would think that conservatives and libertarians would recoil at the idea that someone has lost his liberty without due process. That's my focus. My focus is not on one man. It's on making sure one man's rights are secured so that we can uphold the rule of law.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Senator Van Hollen, thank you. We hope to see you back soon and Happy Easter.",

    "summary": "The meeting came after Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met Saturday with the Vatican's No. 2 official amid tensions for the Trump administration's crackdown on migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, a spokesperson for the vice president said, in a rare meeting after the two men have\u00a0tangled sharply over immigration\u00a0and the Trump administration's plans to deport migrants en masse.",
      "Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.",
      "Francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance had defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \"ordo amoris.\" He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In a Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Vance has\u00a0acknowledged Francis' criticism\u00a0but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a Feb. 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn't address the issue specifically but called himself a \"baby Catholic\" and acknowledged there are \"things about the faith that I don't know.\"",
      "Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter's Basilica after meeting with\u00a0Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.\u00a0On Saturday, the Vances got a private tour of the Sistine Chapel, and the vice president met with the Vatican's No. 2 official.",
      "The Holy See reaffirmed good relations with Vance after the Saturday meeting, but noted \"an exchange of opinions\" over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners.",
      "The Vatican stated that Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.",
      "The Holy See has responded cautiously to the Trump administration, keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality, expressing alarm over the administration's crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid.",
      "Those concerns were reflected in the Vatican's statement on Saturday, which said the talks were cordial and that it expressed satisfaction with the administration's commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.",
      "\"There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,\" the statement said. \"Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.\"",
      "The reference to \"serene collaboration\" appeared to refer to Vance's accusation that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was\u00a0resettling \"illegal immigrants\"\u00a0to get federal funding. Top U.S. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.",
      "\"It is clear that the approach of the current U.S. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years,\" Parolin told La Repubblica daily on the eve of Vance's visit.",
      "The vice president's office confirmed the meeting between Vance and Parolin, saying they \"discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump's commitment to restoring world peace.\"",

      "\"This morning I called Congresswoman Barbara Lee to congratulate her on becoming the next Mayor of Oakland,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"Thanks to the heart, grit, and vision of our fearless team and supporters, we built a movement that resonated across Oakland, echoing the national dialogue about the waning relevance of a Democratic \u00a0Party that puts old-guard politics over improving the lives of everyday people. I pray that Mayor-Elect Lee fulfills her commitment to unify Oakland by authentically engaging the 47% of Oaklanders who voted for me and who want pragmatic results-driven leadership.\"",
      "The Alameda County Registrar of Voters released the latest election numbers on Friday, and the update showed Lee was ahead of Taylor by almost 5,000 votes. According to the county registrar, Lee has 50.6% of the vote, and a candidate needs 50% plus one vote to win. The next election update will be on April 25.",
      "\"While I believe strongly in respecting the democratic voting process and ballots will continue to be counted through Tuesday, the results are clear that the people of Oakland have elected me as your next Mayor. Thank you, Oakland,\" Lee said in a statement.",
      "District 7 Councilmember Ken Houston congratulated Lee Friday prior to Taylor's concession.",
      "\"She's humble. She's like, 'Wait till it's over,' which she should be. Me, I'm saying you can't catch up with 5,000 more votes, right, because the people spoke,\" Houston said.",
      "Lee, a Democrat, represented Oakland in Congress from 1998 until stepping down in January. Last year, she also ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate seat of the late Dianne Feinstein. She previously served in the California State Assembly for six years and the state Senate for two. She earned an undergraduate degree from Mills College in Oakland and a master's degree in social work from UC Berkeley.",
      "Oakland uses a ranked choice system. It allows people to vote for their first choice, but then list other candidates in order of preference. After the first count, if neither of the two leading candidates get more than 50% of the votes, they get to collect the \"ranked\" votes cast for them, in order, until one achieves more than half the votes.",
      "\"We intend to hit the ground running,\" Lee said.",
      "Lee and Taylor were widely considered the frontrunners in the race, which featured a crowded field of 10 candidates. The race was triggered after\u00a0voters recalled Sheng Thao from the mayor's office last year.",

      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, ordered an investigation into unauthorized disclosures in March. His memo said the investigation would seek \"a complete record\" of leaks and use polygraph tests if necessary.",
      "The two now-fired officials are Hegseth's senior advisor Dan Caldwell and deputy chief of staff Dan Selnick, the sources said. Both were put on administrative leave earlier this week pending the leak investigation, CBS News reported. Politico was first to report their termination.",
      "A third official, Colin Carroll, the chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense, was also put on administrative leave this week amid the investigation.",
      "In a joint statement posted on X on Saturday, Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll said they were \"incredibly disappointed\" by how their service with the department ended, calling the experience unconscionable.",
      "\"Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door. All three of us served our country honorably in uniform - for two of us, this included deployments to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, based on our collective service, we understand the importance of information security and worked every day to protect it,\" the statement read.",
      "\"At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of 'leaks' to begin with,\" they said.",

      "\"Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,\" a U.S. official told CBS News. \"We agreed to meet again next week and are grateful to our Omani partners for facilitating these talks and to our Italian partners for hosting us today.\"",
      "After the meeting, Araghchi said the two countries agreed to have another round of negotiations in Oman on April 26. But experts will meet there in the days before.",
      "\"The talks were held in a constructive environment and I can say that is moving forward,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television. \"I hope that we will be in a better position after the technical talks.\"",
      "U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement ahead of the talks that President Trump has been clear that Iran \"cannot have a nuclear weapon\" and that \"all options remain on the table.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 21:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A tranche of records on Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 killing are being unsealed at the urging of the senator's son, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday started releasing the first tranche of records on Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination, with roughly 10,000 pages of previously classified records.",
      "The disclosure \u2014 ordered by President Trump within days of taking office and backed by the senator's son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 could reignite speculation about the decades-old killing, as the younger Kennedy insists his father's convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, might be innocent.",
      "A CBS News review found the documents include scans of handwritten notes by convicted assassin Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene and autopsy photos, FBI memos related to Sirhan and his whereabouts before the shooting, correspondence to the government from the American public in reaction to the assassination, and interviews with Sirhan's family.",
      "Many of the details shared in the files were already known.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the release, which began Friday, comes after an effort done in conjunction with the National Archives and other agency officials to scan and upload more than 10,000 pages, which will be available for the American people to view online \"to fulfill President Trump's maximum transparency promise.\"",
      "The records will be published with limited redactions for privacy reasons, such as to shield Social Security numbers, she said.",
      "Gabbard said that an additional 50,000 pages of files related to Robert F. Kennedy's killing were discovered during searches of CIA and FBI warehouses for documents that had not been turned over to the Archives. Agencies are working to make those documents available and will continue searching government facilities for more, according to the director of national intelligence.",
      "What did the RFK files say?",
      "The documents released so far appear to include Justice Department and FBI memos, as well as photos of evidence collected during the investigation into Robert F. Kennedy's assassination and clippings from news reports. Some scanned records are difficult to read, as are handwritten notes included in the tranche.",
      "Some of Sirhan's apparent notes viewed by CBS News include messages like \"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was\" and \"My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more [and] more of an unshakeable obsession.\" Other notes from Sirhan expressing hatred for Robert F. Kennedy have been publicly known for decades and were referenced at his trial.",
      "Also in the files: A 1968 FBI memo that offered an assessment of Sirhan, including that he fell from a horse and sustained a head injury in 1966, and family members said his behavior changed markedly afterward.",
      "A June 12 FBI memo describes Robert F. Kennedy's widow Ethel Kennedy's \"distraught\" reactions to the shooting, with one ambulance worker recounting she told him, \"keep your hands off him,\" and another witness saying she knocked over a TV news camera and hit a reporter in the chest at the hospital.",
      "Some of the documents detail eyewitness interviews about both Sirhan and the shooting. A few of those records touch on longstanding conspiracy theories about the assassination. There are references to witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him,\" which often features in theories about the shooting, though other witnesses say they didn't spot anybody matching that description.",
      "What could the new RFK files reveal?",
      "It's unclear what new information on the 1968 slaying could emerge from the disclosures, several experts told CBS News before the documents were released. Robert F. Kennedy's killing was primarily investigated and prosecuted by local officials in Los Angeles, and files from that investigation \u2014 along with many records from a parallel FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives for decades with few omissions. It's not clear if other federal agencies hold records tied to the assassination.",
      "The administration has also vowed to release files on Rev. Martin Luther King's 1968 assassination, and it published troves of declassified files on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing in March.",
      "Why did Trump release RFK files \u2014 and is RFK Jr. involved?",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to unseal records on King, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy in late January. In an April 10 cabinet meeting, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the King and Robert F. Kennedy files would be ready within days, including what she described as decades-old documents that \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "\"Nearly 60 years after the tragic assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the American people will, for the first time, have the opportunity to review the federal government's investigation thanks to the leadership of President Trump,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"My team is honored that the President entrusted us to lead the declassification efforts and to shine a long-overdue light on the truth. I extend my deepest thanks for Bobby Kennedy and his families' support.\"",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he's \"very grateful\" for the release.",
      "The health secretary \u2014 who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated \u2014 has shown an interest in the case for years, doubting the conclusion that Sirhan was responsible for his father's killing. Breaking with many of his siblings, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. backed Sirhan's 2021 request for parole after meeting with Sirhan in prison.",
      "Who killed RFK?",
      "Sirhan was arrested shortly after the 1968 assassination, which took place at the Ambassador Hotel while Robert F. Kennedy was running for president, and convicted of murder. He has admitted to killing the senator and linked it to Robert F. Kennedy's backing of Israel, though at other points, he has denied responsibility or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan's requests for parole have been repeatedly rejected. California's parole board backed his 2021 bid for early release, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom overrode their decision.",
      "Still, the case has drawn waves of public attention, as some critics \u2014 including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 claim Sirhan didn't fire the fatal shots or other parties were involved in the killing. Skeptics typically cite issues with eyewitness testimony or the alleged presence of extra bullets at the crime scene \u2014 though other researchers have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",

    "summary": "President Trump could give up on efforts to end the war in Ukraine \"in a matter of days,\" Rubio says, highlighting the administration view that it's \"not our war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may \"move on\" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Months of efforts by the White House have failed to bring an end to the fighting, despite repeated promises by President Trump before he took office that he would use his skills as a negotiator to end the war immediately.",
      "Rubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters upon departure. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio said. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\"",
      "His remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of the Biden administration, during which then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned not long after the war began that Russia's autocratic President Vladimir Putin was determined \"to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also warned, including in multiple interviews with CBS News, that Putin is intent on expanding Russia's borders by force \u2014 and breaking the security bonds forged among Western democracies during World War II, of which the U.S.-led NATO alliance has been the most tangible.",
      "\"For him, we are a satellite of Russian Federation. At the moment, it's us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata about one year ago. \"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members.\"",
      "Zelenskyy called Russia's invasion a war \"against the democracy, against the values, against the whole world,\" acknowledging even then that some in the West might be tired of hearing that message, \"but only those are tired who are not at war, who don't know what war is, and who have never lost his or her children.\"",
      "\"If we do not stand firm, he will advance further,\" Zelenskyy reiterated in an interview with 60 Minutes just this month. \"It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.\"",
      "Trump says \"we have a minerals deal\" with Ukraine",
      "Rubio's comments on Friday came hours after the U.S. and Ukraine seemingly neared a long-delayed deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Trump's peace push.",
      "\"We have a minerals deal,'' Mr. Trump said Thursday, and Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries had signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.",
      "The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term cooperation.",
      "Work toward the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Negotiations have since resumed.",
      "Rubio on the dialogue with Russia, and Europe",
      "Despite apparent growing U.S. impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. \"Nobody rejected anything, nobody got up from the table or walked away.\"",
      "Rubio didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged when they spoke after the Paris talks, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.",
      "When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were scheduled in the coming days.",
      "\"Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,\" he said.",
      "In its readout on the call with Rubio, the Kremlin said Lavrov had confirmed Moscow's \"readiness to continue working together with American colleagues to reliably eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Putin and his deputies have consistently claimed those root causes are Zelenskyy's actions and NATO's eastward expansion \u2014 misleading narratives that Mr. Trump himself has at times espoused about the full-scale invasion Putin launched on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "After weeks of tension with European allies, Rubio told reporters in Paris that the European negotiators proved helpful. \"The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.\"",
      "During a meeting on Friday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome, Vice President JD Vance also spoke about the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, saying he wouldn't \"pre-judge them, but we feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war to a close.\"",
      "European concerns are growing, however, about Mr. Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. These talks were the first time since his inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.",
      "The meetings addressed hypothetical security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again if and when a peace deal is reached.",
      "Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Mr. Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.",
      "Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine continue",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.",
      "One person died and 103 others, including eight children, were wounded as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early on Friday, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. He said cluster munitions struck a \"densely populated\" neighborhood four times.",
      "Russian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.",
      "Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih.",

      "Shapley's appointment to the agency's top post triggered a series of back-channel discussions. Sources have told CBS News they centered on Musk's role in bypassing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's authority to have Shapley \u2014 best-known for speaking out about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax probe \u2014 installed in the post.",
      "Bessent complained to President Trump that Shapley had been installed at the urging of Musk and sought Mr. Trump's approval to undo the decision, according to multiple sources.",
      "Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender \u2014 who is now the agency's acting head, a Treasury spokesperson confirmed \u2014 also voiced concerns with Shapley's appointment, and Bessent sided with Faulkender, multiple sources said.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report Shapley's ouster Friday.",
      "Bessent voiced support for Faulkender's appointment in a social media post Friday afternoon, saying, \"trust must be brought back to the IRS\" and calling Faulkender \"the right man for the moment.\"",
      "Shapley is expected to continue serving as an adviser to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, sources said. Bessent also confirmed that Shapley will continue working at the Treasury Department.",
      "\"Gary Shapley's passion and thoughtfulness for approaching ways by which to create durable and lasting reforms at the IRS is essential to our work, and he remains among my most important senior advisors,\" Bessent wrote.",
      "Shapley was placed at the top of the IRS while President Trump's pick for the job, Billy Long, has been awaiting Senate confirmation. Long, a former congressman from Missouri, has faced questions about his qualifications.",
      "A former supervisor at the agency, Shapley became famous after speaking out about the Hunter Biden tax case. Shapley was a supervisory special agent in his 14th year at the IRS when he came forward in a 2023 interview with CBS News chief investigative correspondent Jim Axelrod. He alleged internal misgivings about improper pressure to go easy on former President Joe Biden's son.",
      "Shapley was one of two IRS whistleblowers to testify before Congress about alleged misgivings in the Hunter Biden probe. The IRS agents alleged the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the investigation and told them not to probe leads related to Joe Biden. They were removed from the case and temporarily sidelined with pay.\u00a0 Hunter Biden later pled guilty to tax crimes and was pardoned by his father.",
      "Shapley and another agent who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about their investigation have already retained high ranking positions in the Trump administration. Shapley was initially assigned to Bessent's office as a senior adviser for IRS reform, and later named deputy director of criminal investigations at the agency.",

    "summary": "Food safety inspections would be left to state and local authorities under the plan being developed by the FDA.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is drawing up plans that would end most of its routine food safety inspections work, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News, and effectively outsource this oversight to state and local authorities.",
      "The plans have not been finalized and might need congressional action to fully fund, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "\"The claim that the FDA is suspending routine food safety inspections is false. FDA is actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and inspections continue,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years, one current and one former official said, which could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico.",
      "\"There's so much work to go around. And us duplicating their work just doesn't make sense,\" one former FDA official, who worked on the plans before leaving the agency and spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said that the state work currently is often reserved for lower-risk inspections. A third of routine food safety inspections were done by states over recent years, a Government Accountability Office report said earlier this year.",
      "The FDA is ultimately responsible for the safety of much of the U.S. food supply that's distributed over state lines, like packaged products, seafood, eggs and produce. Some kinds of meat are regulated by a different agency inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Some higher-risk routine food inspections would likely remain at the FDA under the plans, two officials said. For example, agency staff currently conduct annual visits to infant formula manufacturers, which are overseen separately as \"critical foods\" inspections. States would also not be able to take on the work of routine inspections in foreign food facilities.",
      "It is unclear what would happen for the states that do not have contracts with the FDA to conduct food inspections, which range from Hawaii to Delaware.",
      "In addition to routine inspections, the FDA also does other kinds of inspections in response to issues, like a visit to a Colorado onion processor last year linked to the McDonald's Quarter Pounders outbreak that turned up dozens of violations.",
      "Internal planning around the possibility of outsourcing its routine inspections first picked up after 2010, the former FDA official said, when the agency was working on implementing major food safety legislation passed that year.",
      "The official likened the plans to the FDA's Grade A Milk Safety Program, where states fund the majority of oversight work themselves and have agreements with the agency to standardize how the industry is regulated.",
      "Some states and advocacy groups have called for years for the FDA to move its routine food inspections out to states. States can often do inspections at a lower cost than the FDA, while meeting the same standards, they have argued.",
      "\"FDA audits have determined states inspections to be high quality, and the costs show them to be a good economic value. There is significant cost to managing two systems also,\" said Steve Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials, in a statement.",
      "Mandernach drew a parallel to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under which hospitals and nursing homes are largely inspected by state agencies but overseen by the federal government.",
      "He also pointed to how the FDA regulates produce farms. The FDA has agreements with most states to pay for routine inspections conducted by local agriculture departments, where they often handle inspections and enforcement themselves.",
      "\"Further, we implemented this type of program with produce already and it has been successful, expanding and leveraging those lessons can only provide greater value to the taxpayers, increase oversight of manufacturers, and improve food safety,\" he said.",
      "Ending the FDA's work to do its own routine food safety inspections might also help alleviate an issue elsewhere at the agency: a backlog of inspections overseas, as well as in other markets like medical products.",
      "In the past, FDA inspectors had been trained to do multiple kinds of inspections, officials said, instead of specializing only in food safety inspections.",
      "Steep layoffs at the office's support staff is expected to result in cutbacks to the number of inspections that can be done by the agency, CBS News previously reported. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has also greenlighted plans to hire contractors to attempt to plug the hole left by the laid-off workers.",
      "\"In theory, relying on states to do more routine food inspection work could lead to better food safety,\" said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Gremillion cautioned that a transition in how food inspections are done by the FDA would take significant time and resources.",

    "summary": "A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened on Wednesday to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison last month \u2014 possibly setting the stage for an unprecedented showdown between President Trump and the judicial branch.",
      "Boasberg, who said the government \"deliberately flouted\" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses.",
      "Why could Judge Boasberg hold the Trump administration in contempt of court?",
      "In a searing written decision, Boasberg said the Trump administration showed a \"willful disregard\" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government has cited the 18th-century law to fly hundreds of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, whose government is holding scores of U.S. deportees in a notorious maximum-security prison. The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.",
      "The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung said the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "As it pursues its appeal, the Justice Department has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to\u00a0pause the district court's order, arguing that Boasberg's decision was \"fundamentally misconceived from the start, needlessly prompting a constitutional confrontation over criminal contempt that never should have arisen.\"",
      "What is contempt of court?",
      "Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"",
      "As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \u2014 in this case, potentially a federal official \u2014 willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.",
      "\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.",
      "What happens next in this case?",
      "Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"",
      "Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.",
      "Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.",
      "After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.",
      "However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.",
      "Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?",
      "It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.",
      "But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.",
      "\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.",
      "Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.",
      "For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?",
      "It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.",

      "Don Pettit, NASA's oldest active-duty astronaut, celebrated his 70th birthday with two cosmonaut crewmates overnight Saturday, undocking from the International Space Station and plunging back to Earth in a blaze of re-entry heat to close out a 220-day expedition.",
      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "The program helps bring citizens to space in a reusable suborbital rocket system. Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, set the stage for future human spaceflights with the program when he lifted off on a capsule, named \"First Step,\" in 2021 with three crewmates.",
      "\"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters\u00a0after the successful 2021 spaceflight.",
      "The unpiloted New Shepard capsule has space for six passengers who each have a window seat, looking out of some of the largest windows of any operational spacecraft.",
      "Blue Origin says the goal of the New Shepard program is also to advance research.",
      "\"New Shepard payload flights support a wide range of research, education, and technology development,\" the company added.",
      "How long was Gayle King and the crew in space?",
      "The journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight.",
      "They floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground. They landed at less than 15 miles per hour, astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space, explained to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "\"New Shepard astronauts ascend toward space at more than three times the speed of sound. They pass the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above Earth, before unbuckling to float weightless and gaze at our planet. The crew returns gently under parachutes, forever changed,\" Blue Origin\u00a0describes on its website.",

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

    "summary": "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in Texas' Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law.",
      "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
      "The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.",
      "\"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Thomas, that \"the court hastily and prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief.\" He argued that the high court's intervention was inappropriate because it was unclear that the court had jurisdiction and that there was \"little concrete support\" for the allegation that the migrants were in imminent danger of removal. He also noted that the Supreme Court heard only from the ACLU, and not the government, before acting.",
      "\"In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,\" Alito wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\"",
      "\"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said.",
      "\"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post.",
      "On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.",
      "The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.",
      "The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law.",
      "Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly.",
      "\"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act in March\u00a0to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0New York and southern Texas\u00a0promptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.",
      "But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.",
      "Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.",
      "But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.",
      "An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said.",
      "Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.",
      "With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday.",
      "\"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\"",
      "Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed\u00a0criminal contempt\u00a0by ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.",
      "ICE said it would not comment on the litigation.",
      "Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there.",
      "Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its\u00a0notorious\u00a0main prison.",

    "summary": "Sen. Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Sunday that El Salvador \"tried really hard\" to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, before the government reversed course late last week.",
      "\"I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day,\" Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia is a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who was sent last month to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison as part of a White House effort, although the administration later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly among those deported. The case has come to the fore in recent weeks amid simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia on Thursday after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
      "Van Hollen noted that he held press conferences in El Salvador, where he made the point that the government was \"violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him,\" adding that \"they realized that was a bad look.\"",
      "After Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele was the first to announce the meeting, writing in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was \"now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,\" alongside photos that showed the two men sitting at a table with drinks that resemble margaritas. The president later wrote, \"I love chess.\"",
      "Van Hollen said of the Salvadoran government, \"they go to great lengths to deceive people,\" outlining how drinks were brought to the table as photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, adding that \"no one touched them.\"",
      "\"The reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged,\" Van Hollen said. \"They're trying to create the impression that, you know, this is a guy in paradise, when in fact he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. When he was released from immigration custody, an immigration judge granted him withholding of removal \u2014\u00a0 a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "Van Hollen said Sunday that Abrego Garcia has since been transferred from CECOT to a facility in Santa Ana.",
      "In an update to the federal district court in Maryland, a top State Department official noted Sunday that Abrego Garcia told the senator he had been transferred to Centro Industrial about eight days before their meeting.",
      "\"Abrego Garc\u00eda told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,\" Michael Kozak said in the court filing.",
      "Trump administration officials have since acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Still, a fierce legal battle has ensued around efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The administration was ordered earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, before the Supreme Court ruled that the judge's decision properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release, while the scope should be clarified. On Thursday, a federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause the district judge's order, writing that the government's assertions in the case should be \"shocking\" to all Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House and Bukele have made clear that they don't intend to bring Abrego Garcia back, despite the orders, while Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the gang MS-13. Van Hollen stressed that the administration hasn't presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or other terrorist activity, while urging officials to \"put up or shut up in court.\"",
      "\"Go to court, stop tweeting, and put up or shut up in front of the judges,\" Van Hollen added.",
      "The Maryland Democrat said he did not travel to El Salvador to litigate the details of Abrego Garcia's case, but rather \"to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health.\" But he argued that the case is also much bigger than one man.",
      "\"This is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected, because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man \u2014 as the courts have all said is happening in this case \u2014 you threaten the constitutional rights of every American,\" Van Hollen said.",

      "\"We have to both protect the environment and grow the economy,\" Zeldin said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "As part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy, Zeldin announced in March that the EPA would reconsider rules across a number of sectors, including regulations on power plants, on mercury and air toxic standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The Trump administration touted the 31 deregulatory actions as the \"most momentous day\" in EPA history.",
      "The decisions are the start of what's expected to be a yearslong effort to repeal or revise dozens of environmental rules, much to the dismay of climate experts and advocates.",
      "Zeldin, who formerly represented New York in the House, said at the time of the announcement that \"today the green new scam ends,\" while pledging that the EPA will do its part to \"usher in the golden age of American success.\"",
      "On Sunday, Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that the American people want the administration to \"make sure that we are applying common sense,\" arguing that regulation brought over the finish line during the Biden administration was too broad and targeted entire industries.",
      "\"When the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet,\" Zeldin added. \"What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well.\"",
      "Zeldin said he doesn't prejudge outcomes, noting that there will be a process on the deregulatory actions that includes public comment, while encouraging Americans to \"weigh in when they have that opportunity.\"",

      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",

      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "Chabba is survived by his wife and two children.",
      "\"Tiru Chabba's family is going through the unimaginable now,\" Sellers said in a statement. \"Instead of hiding Easter eggs and visiting with friends and family, they're living a nightmare where this loving father and devoted husband was stolen from them in an act of senseless and preventable violence.\"",
      "\"We ask you to keep his family in your thoughts and prayers as we fight to ensure they see justice that honors the memories of Mr. Chabba and all the victims of Thursday's shooting.\"",

      "\"The minute I got shot, I remember my parents telling me I just need to play dead,\" Askins told CBS News. \"So I released all the muscles in my body, I closed my eyes, I held my breath. I did everything I could to look like I was dead because I didn't want him to shoot me again. God forbid.\"",

      "Help eventually arrived. Askins said the moment a police officer began tending to her injuries, she knew she had survived the worst.",

      "Howard said that the proximity of the hospital to the university also helped with the fast response and immediate treatment, adding that all six patients were seen within an hour of admission.

    "story": [
      "A judge says a former roommate of four University of Idaho students who were killed in 2022 can testify about seeing an intruder with \"bushy eyebrows\" around the time of the crime.",
      "Defense attorneys for Bryan Kohberger had asked 4th District Judge Steven Hippler during a hearing earlier this month to bar any evidence referencing \"bushy eyebrows,\" because they say the roommate's description is unreliable and irrelevant to the case.",
      "But in a ruling released Friday, Hippler said the testimony can be used during Kohberger's trial on four murder charges set to begin later this year.",
      "Kohberger, 30, is charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho.",
      "Kohberger, then a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, was\u00a0arrested in Pennsylvania\u00a0weeks after the deaths. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "When asked to enter a plea to the charges, Kohberger stood silent, prompting the judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "The roommate told police she saw someone wearing black clothing and a ski mask inside the home she shared with four roommates sometime before 4:19 a.m. on the day of the killings, according to court documents.",
      "She was intoxicated at the time, and told police she couldn't remember any other facial characteristics but that the intruder's bushy eyebrows stood out in her memory.",
      "Kohberger's defense attorneys noted that the roommate also constantly questioned what she saw, that her attention was influenced by sleepiness and alcohol, and that her opportunity to see the intruder was seconds at most.",
      "Allowing her to testify about bushy eyebrows when she couldn't provide enough details to allow a police artist to do a composite sketch would be unfair and prejudicial, causing a jury to believe Kohberger is guilty because of his eyebrows, his attorneys said.",
      "But the judge disagreed.",
      "\"There is a large gulf between a finding that a witness is not competent to testify about what they personally witnessed, and simply allowing impeachment by vigorous cross-examination,\" Hippler wrote. \"This is a matter for cross-examination.\"",
      "Hippler also said that if Kohberger is convicted, his defense team can't use his medical diagnoses to explain his \"courtroom demeanor\" unless Kohberger takes the stand during the penalty phase.",
      "Prosecutors had asked the judge to bar any testimony during the penalty phase about Kohberger's autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as the developmental coordination disorder that Kohberger may have experienced in childhood.",
      "The prosecution team said they didn't want mental conditions to be used to try to limit Kohberger's culpability if he is convicted.",
      "But the defense team said they didn't plan on doing that at all, and that instead his autism spectrum diagnosis would be used to explain some of Kohberger's courtroom demeanor, like his tendency to hold eye contact for longer than expected, his ability to sit very still and his stoicism.",
      "The judge said he hadn't noticed any strange behavior.",
      "\"Not once has the Court perceived Defendant to be acting in an odd or incongruent manner or otherwise demonstrating signs at counsel table that would warrant any explanation to the jury. His demeanor has been entirely appropriate,\" Hippler wrote.",
      "Introducing evidence about the autism spectrum diagnosis would likely confuse the jury and take up an undue amount of time in an already long trial, he said.",
      "Still, the judge said, Kohberger's demeanor might become relevant if he takes the stand to testify. Kohberger's OCD diagnosis also might be relevant at some point, Hippler said, particularly since the defense team has said it causes Kohberger to experience sleep difficulties that led to a habit of nighttime driving and running to decompress.",
      "If those scenarios arise during the trial, the judge said the attorneys should bring up the matter to him \u2014 outside the presence of the jury \u2014 so he can make a decision on whether the evidence should be introduced at that time.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 21:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A tranche of records on Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 killing are being unsealed at the urging of the senator's son, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday started releasing the first tranche of records on Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination, with roughly 10,000 pages of previously classified records.",
      "The disclosure \u2014 ordered by President Trump within days of taking office and backed by the senator's son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 could reignite speculation about the decades-old killing, as the younger Kennedy insists his father's convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, might be innocent.",
      "A CBS News review found the documents include scans of handwritten notes by convicted assassin Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene and autopsy photos, FBI memos related to Sirhan and his whereabouts before the shooting, correspondence to the government from the American public in reaction to the assassination, and interviews with Sirhan's family.",
      "Many of the details shared in the files were already known.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the release, which began Friday, comes after an effort done in conjunction with the National Archives and other agency officials to scan and upload more than 10,000 pages, which will be available for the American people to view online \"to fulfill President Trump's maximum transparency promise.\"",
      "The records will be published with limited redactions for privacy reasons, such as to shield Social Security numbers, she said.",
      "Gabbard said that an additional 50,000 pages of files related to Robert F. Kennedy's killing were discovered during searches of CIA and FBI warehouses for documents that had not been turned over to the Archives. Agencies are working to make those documents available and will continue searching government facilities for more, according to the director of national intelligence.",
      "What did the RFK files say?",
      "The documents released so far appear to include Justice Department and FBI memos, as well as photos of evidence collected during the investigation into Robert F. Kennedy's assassination and clippings from news reports. Some scanned records are difficult to read, as are handwritten notes included in the tranche.",
      "Some of Sirhan's apparent notes viewed by CBS News include messages like \"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was\" and \"My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more [and] more of an unshakeable obsession.\" Other notes from Sirhan expressing hatred for Robert F. Kennedy have been publicly known for decades and were referenced at his trial.",
      "Also in the files: A 1968 FBI memo that offered an assessment of Sirhan, including that he fell from a horse and sustained a head injury in 1966, and family members said his behavior changed markedly afterward.",
      "A June 12 FBI memo describes Robert F. Kennedy's widow Ethel Kennedy's \"distraught\" reactions to the shooting, with one ambulance worker recounting she told him, \"keep your hands off him,\" and another witness saying she knocked over a TV news camera and hit a reporter in the chest at the hospital.",
      "Some of the documents detail eyewitness interviews about both Sirhan and the shooting. A few of those records touch on longstanding conspiracy theories about the assassination. There are references to witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him,\" which often features in theories about the shooting, though other witnesses say they didn't spot anybody matching that description.",
      "What could the new RFK files reveal?",
      "It's unclear what new information on the 1968 slaying could emerge from the disclosures, several experts told CBS News before the documents were released. Robert F. Kennedy's killing was primarily investigated and prosecuted by local officials in Los Angeles, and files from that investigation \u2014 along with many records from a parallel FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives for decades with few omissions. It's not clear if other federal agencies hold records tied to the assassination.",
      "The administration has also vowed to release files on Rev. Martin Luther King's 1968 assassination, and it published troves of declassified files on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing in March.",
      "Why did Trump release RFK files \u2014 and is RFK Jr. involved?",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to unseal records on King, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy in late January. In an April 10 cabinet meeting, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the King and Robert F. Kennedy files would be ready within days, including what she described as decades-old documents that \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "\"Nearly 60 years after the tragic assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the American people will, for the first time, have the opportunity to review the federal government's investigation thanks to the leadership of President Trump,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"My team is honored that the President entrusted us to lead the declassification efforts and to shine a long-overdue light on the truth. I extend my deepest thanks for Bobby Kennedy and his families' support.\"",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he's \"very grateful\" for the release.",
      "The health secretary \u2014 who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated \u2014 has shown an interest in the case for years, doubting the conclusion that Sirhan was responsible for his father's killing. Breaking with many of his siblings, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. backed Sirhan's 2021 request for parole after meeting with Sirhan in prison.",
      "Who killed RFK?",
      "Sirhan was arrested shortly after the 1968 assassination, which took place at the Ambassador Hotel while Robert F. Kennedy was running for president, and convicted of murder. He has admitted to killing the senator and linked it to Robert F. Kennedy's backing of Israel, though at other points, he has denied responsibility or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan's requests for parole have been repeatedly rejected. California's parole board backed his 2021 bid for early release, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom overrode their decision.",
      "Still, the case has drawn waves of public attention, as some critics \u2014 including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 claim Sirhan didn't fire the fatal shots or other parties were involved in the killing. Skeptics typically cite issues with eyewitness testimony or the alleged presence of extra bullets at the crime scene \u2014 though other researchers have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis made it his mission to change the perception of the Catholic Church around the world.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 Pope Francis, who challenged deeply rooted norms and made it his mission to change the perception of the Catholic Church around the world, has died at the age of 88. The Vatican said Francis died just after 7:30 a.m. local time on Monday, a day after he surprised many by appearing outside the Vatican on Easter Sunday to greet well-wishers.",
      "Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, formally announced Francis' death on Monday, with a statement saying: \"At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.\"",
      "Tributes praising his leadership and devotion quickly began to pour in from around the world.",
      "Francis had experienced a number of health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries and several serious\u00a0respiratory infections. He spent\u00a0five weeks\u00a0in the\u00a0hospital\u00a0in February and March 2025 with bronchitis that developed into\u00a0pneumonia\u00a0in both lungs. He marked the\u00a012th anniversary of his papacy\u00a0from his hospital room.",
      "The pontiff was pushed in a wheelchair into the room for an interview\u00a0at his Vatican residence\u00a0with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in April 2024. But while he was having difficulty walking, he spoke clearly during the\u00a0hourlong conversation\u00a0about his prayers for an end to the\u00a0wars in Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine. In more recent appearances, however, the pontiff clearly struggled for breath as he delivered planned remarks.",
      "After being elected by his fellow Catholic cardinals in 2013, Francis set the tone with his first official act as pope, reversing a centuries-old tradition \u2014 by simply asking for help.",
      "Normally after a new pope is elected, they come out and bless the masses gathered at St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. But when Francis was elected, he came out and first asked the faithful to bless and pray for him.",
      "\"I want to ask you a favor,\" he said. \"Before the bishop blesses the people, I ask that you would pray to the lord to bless me.\"",
      "It may seem a subtle change, but along with his familiar greeting and farewell to the crowd in Italian that day, it set the tone for his entire papacy. Francis made it clear that he identified himself as a brother pilgrim, not as an imperial pope. He didn't want to keep leading a one-way monologue from the highest post in the Catholic Church, but a dialogue.",
      "As pope, the man previously known as Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose to name himself after Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of Italy, known for his simplicity and humanity.",
      "The first pope from the New World, born and raised in Argentina, he said he wanted \"a poorer Church\" and one that would \"include the excluded.\"",
      "He set an example by choosing to live in Room 201 at the Santa Marta \u2014 a small Vatican hotel usually used for visiting priests \u2014 rather than in the lavish papal apartments used by his predecessors. Francis carried his own bag, and walked across Rome to buy his own pair of glasses.",
      "His desire to reach out to ordinary people sent the bulletproof \"popemobiles\" into storage.",
      "\"I cannot greet people from inside a sardine can,\" Francis famously explained, \"even if it is made of glass.\"",
      "He became one of the most popular public figures in the world, regularly speaking up for the voiceless and leading by example \u2014 whether that was by dining with the homeless, washing inmates' feet, or providing a home in Italy for migrants and refugees fleeing war or economic instability.",
      "Francis railed against consumerism and individualism, and he insisted that \"unfair economic structures\" were a violation of human rights.",
      "He also pushed for progress in combating climate change, even publishing an encyclical \u2014 a formal letter from himself to Catholic leaders around the world \u2014 on the topic. And he reformed the Curia \u2014 the central administration of the church \u2014 allowing lay men and women to run Vatican offices, positions historically reserved for cardinals and bishops.",
      "Francis continued to give his public prayers during the coronavirus lockdowns, but with crowds banned, \"the people's pope\" was left to deliver his messages in an empty St. Peter's Square.",
      "Wasting no time after getting his COVID vaccine, Francis made a daring, first-ever\u00a0papal visit to Iraq, despite immense security risks. In Mosul, where ISIS militants once ransacked churches, Pope Francis prayed in them.",
      "A few months later, his health finally caught up with him. He spent 10 days\u00a0in a Rome hospital\u00a0in July 2021 recovering from a scheduled surgery to remove part of his colon. It was the first time he was hospitalized after being named pope.",
      "In 2022, a torn knee ligament forced Francis to finally\u00a0slow down. He was using a wheelchair and canceling both Vatican celebrations and overseas trips, generating persistent rumors that Francis, like Pope Benedict XVI, would\u00a0resign. When\u00a0Benedict died, Francis\u00a0presided over\u00a0his funeral, the first time in modern history a pope has laid his predecessor to rest.",
      "Over time, Francis' papacy began to be defined by a topic he did not choose: the wave of clerical sex abuse scandals that stretched to the very highest levels of the Catholic Church. He was accused, at first, of being insensitive in his slow response to the crisis.",
      "Then he tried to take control of the narrative, notably summoning senior clerics from around the world to the Vatican in early 2019. From that meeting came new Vatican laws about sex abuse, and a mandate that every diocese set up a clear reporting process. Francis also abolished the top-level confidentiality of the \"pontifical secret,\" which had shrouded the sex abuse crisis in yet another layer of systemic secrecy.",
      "His diplomatic skill was on display when he\u00a0played a key role\u00a0in restoring relations between the United States and its decades-old enemy, Cuba.",
      "Francis' simple style was a product of his humble beginnings. He was born on Dec. 17, 1936, to an immigrant Italian railway worker and a housewife in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a young man, he lost part of a lung to an infection. He worked at various menial jobs and studied chemistry.",
      "After being ordained as a priest at the late age of 32, he made visiting the slums of Buenos Aires and caring for the city's poor a feature of his ministry.",
      "During a press conference aboard one papal flight years later, he appeared to crack open a space for homosexuals in the church, with a single, highly symbolic phrase: \"Who am I to judge?\"\u00a0he asked\u00a0when a reporter fired him a question about LGBTQ rights.",
      "But while he may have received widespread credit for changing the tone of the church when it comes to acceptance, the church's teachings and policy did not change.",
      "Despite drawing fire from Catholic conservatives for being too liberal, Francis reaffirmed long-standing church doctrines\u00a0opposing same-sex marriage, and on pretty much everything else from birth control to\u00a0ordaining women.",
      "Francis claimed that he only brought a small bag to the papal conclave in 2013 that saw him elected, because he expected to be going back home to Argentina.",
      "Instead, neither his life, nor the papacy, were ever the same again.",

    "story": [
      "A Vietnamese property tycoon who was jailed for life in a $17 billion money laundering case had her sentence cut to 30 years on appeal on Monday after she claimed what happened was \"an accident.\"",
      "Property developer Truong My Lan had already lost a challenge against the death penalty in a separate case in which she was found guilty in April last year of stealing money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and fraud amounting to $27 billion.",
      "The appeal court ruled there was no basis to reduce her sentence but said she could still escape the death penalty if she returned three-quarters of the stolen assets. That means she could still avoid execution if she returns $9 billion, or three-quarters of the $12 billion she embezzled, the\u00a0BBC reported.",
      "Four months later, an appeal court in Ho Chi Minh City ruled on Monday that a life sentence she was handed for three crimes during a second trial in October would be reduced to 30 years.",
      "\"Lan played the major role... (but) we also take into consideration the amount of money that Lan has spent on overcoming the consequences,\" judge Pham Cong Muoi said following discussions during the appeal about how her assets may be used to compensate victims of her crimes.",
      "Prosecutors said she had repaid a quarter of the $1.2 billion she defrauded from thousands of bond investors.",
      "\"The total value of her holdings actually exceeds the required compensation amount,\" lawyer Nguyen Huy Thiep told the BBC before her appeal was rejected. \"However, these require time and effort to sell, as many of the assets are real estate and take time to liquidate. Truong My Lan hopes the court can create the most favorable conditions for her to continue making compensation.\"",
      "Lan's husband Chu Lap Co did not appeal, but the judging panel concluded that his two-year sentence should be cut by half after he paid back the $1.2 million he was found to have laundered.",
      "In her final words before the court last week, Lan described what happened as \"an accident.\"",
      "\"Since being jailed, I have tried my best... to seek the best solutions to (deal with my) projects and properties,\" she was quoted as saying by state media.",
      "\"Please acknowledge my effort,\" she added.",
      "Court determined Lan was \"the mastermind\"",
      "The 68-year-old was found guilty in October of laundering $17.7 billion and illegal cross-border trafficking of $4.5 billion.",
      "She was also found guilty of bond fraud.",
      "The court determined during the trial that Lan was \"the mastermind, committed the crime with sophisticated methods, many times, causing especially serious consequences.\"",
      "During her first trial in April 2024, Lan was found guilty of embezzling $12.5 billion but prosecutors said the damages caused by the scam totaled $27 billion -- equivalent to around six percent of Vietnam's 2023 GDP.",
      "Lan owned just five percent of shares in SCB on paper but the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90 percent through family, friends and staff.",
      "Tens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in the bank lost money, prompting rare protests in the communist nation.",
      "During her trial, Lan was sometimes defiant, but in the recent hearings for her appeal against the sentence she was more contrite,\u00a0the BBC reported. She said she was ashamed to have been such a drain on the state, and that her only thought was to pay back what she had taken.",
      "\"I feel pained due to the waste of national resources,\" Lan said in November, adding she felt \"very embarrassed to be charged with this crime.\"",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis made a brief appearance on Easter Sunday to bless the thousands of people in St. Peter's Square as he continues his recovery from a near-fatal bout of double pneumonia.",
      "\"Brothers and sisters, Happy Easter!\" Francis said, his voice sounding stronger than it has since his hospitalization. \"Viva il Papa!\" (Long live the pope), the crowd responded.",
      "Francis looped through the square in his open-topped popemobile and then up and down the main avenue leading to it. He stopped occasionally to bless babies brought up to him, a scene that was common in the past but unthinkable just a few weeks ago as the 88-year-old Francis fought for his life.",
      "Since his release from the hospital nearly a month ago, Francis has been slowly returning to work and has made several Sunday appearances at St. Peter's Square, much to the relief and adoration of the crowd that gathers every weekend. He skipped the solemn services of Good Friday and Holy Saturday leading up to Easter, but he had been expected to appear on Sunday.",
      "Unlike in years past, the 88-year-old pontiff did not celebrate the Easter Mass in the piazza, delegating it to Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the retired archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "But after the Mass ended, Francis appeared on the loggia balcony over the basilica entrance for more than 20 minutes. The thousands of people below erupted in cheers as a military band kicked off rounds of the Holy See and Italian anthems.",
      "Francis waved from the balcony and then asked a Vatican archbishop to read his speech, a global appeal for peace in the world's hotspots that is the hallmark of the Vatican's Easter celebrations. Afterward, he imparted the apostolic blessing in Latin.",
      "On his way to the basilica, Francis briefly met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who spent Easter in Rome with his family.",
      "Easter is the most joyful moment on the Christian liturgical calendar, when the faithful celebrate the resurrection of Christ after his crucifixion. This year, Easter is being celebrated on the same day by Catholics and Orthodox Christians.",
      "Easter at the Vatican traditionally involves a Mass and the pope's Urbi et Orbi blessing (Latin for \"to the city and the world\"), a papal speech delivered from the loggia, which is usually a roundup of global hotspots and human suffering.",
      "In the speech, read by Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of liturgical ceremonies, Francis appealed for peace in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as Congo, Myanmar and in other hotspots.",
      "\"May the risen Christ grant Ukraine, devastated by war, his Easter gift of peace, and encourage all parties involved to pursue efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace,\" the message said. \"In this Jubilee year, may Easter also be a fitting occasion for the liberation of prisoners of war and political prisoners!\"",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of creating a false appearance of honoring the Easter ceasefire, saying his country's forces had recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults by units along the front line, as well as dozens of drone strikes.",
      "\"As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on X.",
      "In a later update, Zelenskyy said that despite Ukraine declaring a symmetrical approach to Russian actions, there had been an increase in Russian shelling and drone attacks since 10 a.m. local time. He said, however, that it was \"a good thing, at least, that there were no air raid sirens.\"",
      "\"In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage,\" he wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said that Ukrainian forces launched overnight attacks in the Donetsk region and had sent 48 drones into Russian territory.",
      "According to the ministry, there were \"dead and wounded among the civilian population,\" without giving details. It claimed Russian troops had strictly observed the ceasefire.",
      "Russia-installed officials in the partially occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson also said that Ukrainian forces continued their attacks.",
      "According to the Kremlin, the ceasefire will last from 6 p.m. Moscow time on Saturday to midnight following Easter Sunday. Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock.",

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, a spokesperson for the vice president said, in a rare meeting after the two men have\u00a0tangled sharply over immigration\u00a0and the Trump administration's plans to deport migrants en masse.",
      "Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.",
      "Francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance had defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \"ordo amoris.\" He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In a Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Vance has\u00a0acknowledged Francis' criticism\u00a0but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a Feb. 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn't address the issue specifically but called himself a \"baby Catholic\" and acknowledged there are \"things about the faith that I don't know.\"",
      "Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter's Basilica after meeting with\u00a0Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.\u00a0On Saturday, the Vances got a private tour of the Sistine Chapel, and the vice president met with the Vatican's No. 2 official.",
      "The Holy See reaffirmed good relations with Vance after the Saturday meeting, but noted \"an exchange of opinions\" over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners.",
      "The Vatican stated that Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.",
      "The Holy See has responded cautiously to the Trump administration, keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality, expressing alarm over the administration's crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid.",
      "Those concerns were reflected in the Vatican's statement on Saturday, which said the talks were cordial and that it expressed satisfaction with the administration's commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.",
      "\"There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,\" the statement said. \"Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.\"",
      "The reference to \"serene collaboration\" appeared to refer to Vance's accusation that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was\u00a0resettling \"illegal immigrants\"\u00a0to get federal funding. Top U.S. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.",
      "\"It is clear that the approach of the current U.S. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years,\" Parolin told La Repubblica daily on the eve of Vance's visit.",

      "\"On humanitarian grounds, today from 6 p.m. to midnight from Sunday to Monday, the Russian side announces an Easter truce,\" Putin said in a televised statement released by the Kremlin. The statement has been translated. \"For this period, I order to stop all fighting. We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to reflect possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"",
      "Putin first announced the ceasefire in a meeting with Chief of the General Staff Velary Gerasimov, the Kremlin Press Service said.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said in a translated statement that the ceasefire is imposed \"for humanitarian purposes and will be observed by the Russian Unified Group of Troops (forces) provided that it is mutually respected by the Kiev regime.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said if Russia is genuinely ready to observe a full and unconditional ceasefire, Ukraine will mirror that approach and strike only in defense.",
      "He said such a gesture, particularly over the Easter weekend, could reveal Moscow's true intentions.",
      "\"If a full ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond Easter Day on April 20,\" Zelenskyy said on Telegram. \"That will reveal Russia's true intentions, as 30 hours are enough for headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures.\"",
      "Zelenskyy added that, according to military reports, Russian assaults and artillery fire continued along parts of the 600-mile-long front line.",
      "In response to the ceasefire announcement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Kyiv had in March \"agreed unconditionally to the U.S. proposal of a full interim ceasefire for 30 days,\" which Russia rejected.",
      "\"Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a ceasefire. 30 hours instead of 30 days,\" Sybiha continued, writing on X. \"Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions.\"",
      "Previous attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them. Ukraine last month agreed to President Trump's proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, only for Putin to reject it.",
      "Russia and Ukraine conduct prisoner exchange",
      "Also Saturday, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner swap that was mediated by the United Arab Emirates, Russian state news agency TASS reported.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said 246 Russian service members were returned from territory controlled by Kyiv, and that as a \"gesture of goodwill,\" 31 wounded Ukrainian prisoners of war were transferred in exchange for 15 wounded Russian soldiers in need of urgent medical care.",
      "Zelenskyy said 277 Ukrainian \"warriors have returned home from Russian captivity.\" He thanked the United Arab Emirates for mediating the exchange.",
      "It was the largest exchange since Russia invaded Ukraine over three years ago.",
      "Announcement follows frustration from Trump administration",
      "The announcement came the day after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump's administration was ready to \"move on\" from peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if progress was not made in the coming days. Rubio made the comments in Paris, after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters while departing Paris. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio added. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\" Another meeting is expected next week in London.",
      "Later Friday, Mr. Trump echoed Rubio's frustrations with the pace of the talks. When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between the U.S. and Russia, though he said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Putin were scheduled for the coming days.",
      "Fighting before ceasefire",
      "Earlier Saturday, Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces pushed Ukrainian forces from one of their last remaining footholds in Russia's Kursk region. Russian forces took control of the village of Oleshnya, on the border with Ukraine, the ministry said. Gerasimov said Russian troops had retaken 99% of the territory seized by Ukraine.",
      "\"In the areas of the Kursk region where Ukraine armed force mounted an incursion, the main part of the territory... is now liberated. That's 1,260 square kilometres, 99.5 percent,\" Gerasimov told Putin.",
      "The Associated Press was unable to immediately verify the claim. In the same statement where he reacted to the ceasefire, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces \"continued their activity\" and are \"maintaining their positions\" in the Kursk region. He also said that military forces \"advanced and increased our zone of control\" in Belgorod, a Russian city about 24 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border.",
      "According to TASS, Russia is still fighting to push Ukrainian forces out of the village of Gornal, some 7 miles south of Oleshnya.",
      "\"The Russian military has yet to push the Ukrainian armed forces out of Gornal ... in order to completely liberate the Kursk region. Fierce fighting is underway in the settlement,\" the agency reported, citing Russian security agencies.",

      "Don Pettit, NASA's oldest active-duty astronaut, celebrated his 70th birthday with two cosmonaut crewmates overnight Saturday, undocking from the International Space Station and plunging back to Earth in a blaze of re-entry heat to close out a 220-day expedition.",
      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "\"Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,\" a U.S. official told CBS News. \"We agreed to meet again next week and are grateful to our Omani partners for facilitating these talks and to our Italian partners for hosting us today.\"",
      "After the meeting, Araghchi said the two countries agreed to have another round of negotiations in Oman on April 26. But experts will meet there in the days before.",
      "\"The talks were held in a constructive environment and I can say that is moving forward,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television. \"I hope that we will be in a better position after the technical talks.\"",
      "U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement ahead of the talks that President Trump has been clear that Iran \"cannot have a nuclear weapon\" and that \"all options remain on the table.\"",
      "\"The president has authorized direct and indirect discussions with Iran to make this point clear, but he's also made clear this cannot go on indefinitely,\" Hughes said. \"The Trump administration's entire national security leadership team is committed to the president's posture on Iran to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East and security here at home.\"",
      "Oman's capital, Muscat,\u00a0hosted the first round of negotiations\u00a0between Araghchi and Witkoff last weekend, which saw the two men meet face to face after indirect talks.

      "That the talks are even happening represents a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. Mr. Trump, in his first term, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon.",
      "\"I'm for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\"",
      "Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei told Iranian state TV the talks were \"indirect\" with the delegations in \"different halls\" at the embassy. He earlier wrote Saturday on X that Iran \"always demonstrated, with good faith and a sense of responsibility, its commitment to diplomacy as a civilized way to resolve issues.\"",
      "\"We are aware that it is not a smooth path, but we take every step with open eyes, relying also on the past experiences,\" Baghaei added.",
      "Araghchi met Saturday morning with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani ahead of the talks with Witkoff.",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, also met Tajani on Saturday. Grossi's agency would likely be key in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached, as it did with the 2015 accord Iran reached with world powers.",
      "Tajani said Italy was ready \"to facilitate the continuation of the talks even for sessions at the technical level.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump could give up on efforts to end the war in Ukraine \"in a matter of days,\" Rubio says, highlighting the administration view that it's \"not our war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may \"move on\" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Months of efforts by the White House have failed to bring an end to the fighting, despite repeated promises by President Trump before he took office that he would use his skills as a negotiator to end the war immediately.",
      "Rubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters upon departure. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio said. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\"",
      "His remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of the Biden administration, during which then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned not long after the war began that Russia's autocratic President Vladimir Putin was determined \"to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also warned, including in multiple interviews with CBS News, that Putin is intent on expanding Russia's borders by force \u2014 and breaking the security bonds forged among Western democracies during World War II, of which the U.S.-led NATO alliance has been the most tangible.",
      "\"For him, we are a satellite of Russian Federation. At the moment, it's us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata about one year ago. \"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members.\"",
      "Zelenskyy called Russia's invasion a war \"against the democracy, against the values, against the whole world,\" acknowledging even then that some in the West might be tired of hearing that message, \"but only those are tired who are not at war, who don't know what war is, and who have never lost his or her children.\"",
      "\"If we do not stand firm, he will advance further,\" Zelenskyy reiterated in an interview with 60 Minutes just this month. \"It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.\"",
      "Trump says \"we have a minerals deal\" with Ukraine",
      "Rubio's comments on Friday came hours after the U.S. and Ukraine seemingly neared a long-delayed deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Trump's peace push.",
      "\"We have a minerals deal,'' Mr. Trump said Thursday, and Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries had signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.",
      "The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term cooperation.",
      "Work toward the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Negotiations have since resumed.",
      "Rubio on the dialogue with Russia, and Europe",
      "Despite apparent growing U.S. impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. \"Nobody rejected anything, nobody got up from the table or walked away.\"",
      "Rubio didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged when they spoke after the Paris talks, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.",
      "When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were scheduled in the coming days.",
      "\"Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,\" he said.",
      "In its readout on the call with Rubio, the Kremlin said Lavrov had confirmed Moscow's \"readiness to continue working together with American colleagues to reliably eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Putin and his deputies have consistently claimed those root causes are Zelenskyy's actions and NATO's eastward expansion \u2014 misleading narratives that Mr. Trump himself has at times espoused about the full-scale invasion Putin launched on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "After weeks of tension with European allies, Rubio told reporters in Paris that the European negotiators proved helpful. \"The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.\"",
      "During a meeting on Friday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome, Vice President JD Vance also spoke about the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, saying he wouldn't \"pre-judge them, but we feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war to a close.\"",
      "European concerns are growing, however, about Mr. Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. These talks were the first time since his inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.",
      "The meetings addressed hypothetical security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again if and when a peace deal is reached.",
      "Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Mr. Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.",
      "Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine continue",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.",
      "One person died and 103 others, including eight children, were wounded as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early on Friday, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. He said cluster munitions struck a \"densely populated\" neighborhood four times.",
      "Russian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.",
      "Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih.",

Thornton, 34, landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy with Company H, 2nd Battalion, 116th Infantry Regimental Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division as part of the second wave of the invasion, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. D-Day, or Operation Overlord, was a massive Allied invasion of northern France by air and sea during World War II. The operation, on June 6, 1944, marked the beginning of the liberation of Europe from Hitler's rule.",
      "The company disembarked from their landing craft at around 7 a.m. Fellow soldiers observed Thornton wading ashore, but he was not seen again after that, the DPAA said. The day after the invasion, Thornton's unit searched for him, but he was not found. He was officially listed as missing in action. His name was engraved on the Walls of the Missing at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France.",
      "On June 8, 1944, two days after D-Day, graves registration personnel recovered a set of remains from Omaha Beach that they were unable to identify, the DPAA said. The remains were interred at U.S. Military Cemetery Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, near Omaha Beach, and marked as X-159 St. Laurent.",
      "In 1945, an attempt was made to identify the unknown remains, but the effort was unsuccessful, the DPAA said. Analysts with the American Graves Registration Command failed to identify the remains again in 1947. Two years later, in 1949, a board of officers from the command recommended the remains be declared unidentifiable.",
      "In April 2022, two families, including Thornton's, requested that X-159 be disinterred. The families asked that the remains be compared to those of Thornton and another soldier. The remains were exhumed in September 2023 and transferred to the DPAA laboratory. Scientists conducted dental and anthropological analyses and mitochondrial DNA analysis, the DPAA said.",
      "Those efforts finally identified the remains as belonging to Thornton. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing to indicate that he has been accounted for, the DPAA said, and he will be buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C.",

    "summary": "U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels killed dozens and wounded more than 100 others, the group says.",
    "story": [
      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates \u2014 U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels killed 58 people and wounded 126 others, the group said Friday, marking what appeared to be the single-deadliest known attack under President Trump's new campaign targeting the rebels.",
      "Assessing the toll of Mr. Trump's campaign, which began March 15, has been incredibly difficult as the U.S. military's Central Command so far hasn't released any information on the campaign, its specific targets and how many people have been killed. Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi rebels strictly control access to areas attacked and don't publish information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",
      "But the strike on the Ras Isa oil port, which sent massive fireballs shooting into the night sky, represented a major escalation of the American campaign. The Houthis also immediately released graphic footage of those killed in the attack.",
      "The war in Yemen, meanwhile, was further internationalized as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \"directly supporting\" Houthi attacks, something Beijing didn't immediately acknowledge.",
      "The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath of the attack on Ras Isa port, showing corpses strewn across the site. It said paramedic and civilians workers at the port had been killed in the attack, which sparked a massive explosion and fires.",
      "In a statement, Central Command said \"U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\"",
      "\"This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\" it added. It didn't acknowledge any casualties and declined to comment when asked by The Associated Press regarding civilians reportedly being killed.",
      "The Ras Isa port, a collection of three oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. NASA satellites that track forest fires showed an intense blaze early Friday morning at the site just off Kamaran Island, targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the last few days.",
      "The Ras Isa port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate that's still held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, back in 2015. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.",
      "The Houthis and Iran denounced the U.S. attack.",
      "\"This completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen's sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,\" the Houthis said in a statement carried by the SABA news agency they control. \"It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.\"",
      "Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Tehran \"strongly condemned the barbaric U.S. air strike,\" calling it \"an example of aggressive crime and a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the U.N. Charter,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "On April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen.",
      "\"The United States will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports,\" it said.",
      "The attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis that previously hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel.",
      "U.S. says Chinese satellite image provider is aiding Houthis",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \"directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\"",
      "Bruce didn't elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a story by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People's Liberation Army has provided images enabling the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.",
      "\"Beijing's support, by the way, of that company, the satellite company, even after we've engaged in discussions with them about this ... certainly contradicts their claims of being peace supporters,\" Bruce said.",
      "Chinese officials and the company, known by the acronym CGSTL, couldn't be immediately reached for comment. Chinese state media didn't acknowledge the accusation. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned CGSTL in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine as part of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Mr. Trump appears more extensive than the one under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \"Israeli\" ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip as that war grinds on. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That's greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships, without success.",
      "The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. A second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. is due to happen Saturday in Rome.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations\u00a0closing in on half a century of enmity. Mr, Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",

      "The Democratic senator shared a photo with Abrego Garcia at what appears to be a restaurant.",
      "\"I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.\"",

      "Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele also posted photos\u00a0of the meeting, but suggested Abrego Garcia will remain incarcerated by his government, which is being paid by the United States to hold deportees: \"Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, said in a statement after the meeting her \"prayers have been answered.\"",
      "\"We still have so many questions, hopes, and fears. I will continue praying and fighting for Kilma's' return home,\" Vasquez wrote.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai called Van Hollen's visit \"truly disgusting,\" writing, \"Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist.\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers have strongly denied any connections to MS-13.",
      "The surprise meeting with Van Hollen marks Abrego Garcia's first known appearance since last month, when his deportation to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center drew national attention and sparked a legal standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "The administration admitted in court papers Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador \u2014 along with hundreds of other Salvadoran and Venezuelan migrants \u2014 due to an \"administrative error.\" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, and the Supreme Court backed up that order, but he has remained in El Salvador since then, with Xinis suggesting the government hasn't complied with her order and demanding regular updates on his status.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, arguing it's up to El Salvador to decide whether to return Abrego Garcia \u2014 an argument an appeals court called \"shocking\" on Thursday. The government has also alleged Abrego Garcia is linked to Salvadoran gang MS-13, citing a confidential informant, though his attorneys have denied that allegation and noted Abrego Garcia has not been charged or convicted of any crimes.",
      "Abrego Garcia, 29, was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2011 at the age of 16. He was arrested outside a Maryland Home Depot in 2019, but a judge barred the government from deporting him to El Salvador, warning he could be persecuted by gangs in his home country. Years later, in March of this year, he was detained by immigration agents in Maryland and sent to the Salvadoran detention center, known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case is at the center of a controversial push by the Trump administration to send scores of migrants \u2014 including accused members of MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 to CECOT using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport citizens of an enemy nation during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The gambit has been challenged in court, with opponents decrying conditions in CECOT and\u00a0arguing the government is denying migrants the right to due process. A \"60 Minutes\" report found most of the 238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT on several planes last month had no apparent criminal record. But the Trump administration has defended its use of the law, arguing it is cracking down on gang violence.",
      "Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia\u00a0came after the senator was turned away Thursday at a military checkpoint near CECOT. He said he was about three kilometers from the notorious supermax prison, when he was stopped by soldiers, who he said were ordered to prevent him from going toward the prison.",
      "Van Hollen left for El Salvador on Wednesday, intending to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being. He provided updates on his journey.",

    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"",
      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\"",
      "Meloni and Trump seem to \"get along great\"",
      "Meloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Meloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"",
      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",

      "And it worked.\u00a0 Within three years, Aflac\u2019s sales doubled and name recognition shot from 10 percent to 90 percent.\u00a0 And now the duck is helping beyond the bottom line.\u00a0 Proceeds from its sale are used to fund the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center in Atlanta.\u00a0 So far, more than $200 million has been raised.",
      "The company also produces a special robotic version of the duck that helps soothe child cancer and sickle cell patients, which it distributes free at treatment centers throughout the country.\u00a0 Aflac has given away almost 40,000 of those special ducks, with plans for many more in the coming years.\u00a0 Amos says it\u2019s all part of a company-wide culture of philanthropy.\u00a0 \"As you can imagine, when the child's calm, the parents are calm,\" he says.\u00a0 \"And so, it works hand in hand in ultimately making things better.\""

      "In recent years, smartwatches have gone far beyond just telling the time or tracking steps. These little gadgets on our wrists are becoming powerful health tools, quietly monitoring our bodies and sometimes even alerting us to serious medical issues before we realize something\u2019s wrong.

      "Take Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story, for example. Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn\u2019t think much of it. But her new\u00a0Apple Watch kept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s.",
      "At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life.",

Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren\u2019t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference.",
      "Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy an\u00a0Apple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated. She has also had complete strangers come to see her in the hospital to discuss their own cancer journeys, and as Amanda cannot work in her role as a psychiatrist, these interactions have been great, allowing Amanda to \u2018help\u2019 people again, which, after all, is her vocation in life.\"",

      "While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it\u2019s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone\u2019s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It\u2019s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses.",

      "Data breaches usually happen for one reason \u2014 financial gain. This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",
      "One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place.",
      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus.",
      "When you activate a fraud alert, it notifies the bureaus that there may be suspicious activity on your account. As a result, any attempts to open new credit or make changes will be looked at more carefully.",
      "Equifax: You can place a\u00a0fraud alert online\u00a0or by calling their customer support at (888) 298-0045.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Now that your credit accounts are secured, there\u2019s one more step worth taking, a broader layer of protection. I\u2019m talking about personal data removal services. These companies specialize in removing your personal information from the internet. With how easy it is for someone to find details like your name, address, contact info, relatives \u00a0and more, you and your loved ones are at greater risk for scams and identity theft.",
      "This is especially true for older adults, who are often seen as easier targets by scammers. Even just for peace of mind, it\u2019s worth taking this extra step. There are plenty of services out there that tackle this issue.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Encourage your loved ones to regularly review their bank and credit card statements for any suspicious transactions or do it for them. Early detection can help prevent significant financial loss.",
      "Many elderly people fall victim to scams due to limited digital literacy. Providing basic cybersecurity education, such as recognizing phishing emails, avoiding suspicious links and using strong passwords, can significantly reduce their risk of being targeted.

It's about continually updating your strategies as new threats emerge. By combining these measures, like freezing credit accounts, using fraud alerts, removing personal data from the internet, installing strong antivirus software, regularly reviewing financial statements and educating them on internet safety, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind for both you and your loved ones.",

      "Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to steal your data. As people become more aware of common threats like phishing links, fake websites, fraudulent emails and impersonation scams, attackers are becoming more creative in their approach.",
      "One of the newer methods they are using involves targeting USB flash drives. It may seem surprising that they would focus on something as simple as a flash drive, but the data it holds can be valuable.",
      "Plus, flash drives can be used to spread malware to other devices.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "A person plugging in a USB flash drive to a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why target USB flash drives?",
      "USB drives are ubiquitous in workplaces, especially in environments with air-gapped systems or restricted internet access, such as those in government and energy sectors. This makes them an easy target for data theft and malware propagation. Often, these drives store sensitive files that are not available on networked systems.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "When infected, USB drives can spread\u00a0malware not just within a single organization but also across multiple entities if shared. These attacks don\u2019t rely on network vulnerabilities, allowing them to bypass traditional security tools.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How hackers are targeting your USB drives",
      "As reported by\u00a0Kaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneaky programs like PowerModul and PowerTaskel on the victim\u2019s system.",
      "These tools don\u2019t just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It\u2019s a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control (C2) server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm.",
      "FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there\u2019s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.",
      "What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "4 practical ways to stay safe from USB-targeted attacks",
      "1. Don\u2019t plug in unknown USB drives:\u00a0It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren\u2019t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.",
      "2.\u00a0Be extra cautious with email attachments:\u00a0GOFFEE\u2019s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender\u2019s address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to \"enable macros\" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.",
      "3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many attacks like GOFFEE\u2019s start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Scan USB drives before use:\u00a0The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don\u2019t click them until verified safe.",
      "DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON\u2019T: HERE\u2019S WHY YOU NEED BOTH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals thrive where convenience meets oversight. However, it\u2019s worth considering why USBs remain such a soft target. They\u2019re not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud. But that trust is a blind spot. Attackers like GOFFEE don\u2019t need zero days because they can exploit human habits such as sharing drives, skipping scans and clicking without thinking.",

However, this same feature can be exploited if someone with the right equipment gets close enough to scan your card without your knowledge. Using\u00a0RFID-blocking gear such as a wallet, card sleeve or passport holder is a simple and affordable way to prevent this type of theft. These items are widely available and effective at blocking unauthorized scans.",
      "Limiting the number of cards you bring reduces the risk of your wallet being lost or stolen. Ideally,\u00a0take only one or two credit cards that you plan to use during your trip. Keep any backup cards in your hotel safe and store a secure digital record of your card details in a\u00a0password manager.

      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or even lab records, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the LSC breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the LSC breach, including Social Security numbers, insurance info and even medical IDs. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Keep tabs on your medical records:\u00a0The LSC breach included lab results, diagnoses and treatment data, making medical identity theft a growing concern. Someone could use your info to get care or prescriptions under your name. Regularly review your medical records and insurance claims. If anything looks off, report it to your provider or insurer immediately.",
      "6. Watch out for suspicious snail mail: After the LSC data breach, attackers may use your stolen information to send official-looking letters by post, posing as healthcare providers, insurers or even government agencies. These letters might ask you to call a number, visit a website or provide additional personal information. Just because it arrives in your mailbox doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s trustworthy. Always verify the source by looking up contact details independently and avoid responding directly to unsolicited mail asking for sensitive information.",
      "7. Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable\u00a0MFA on all critical accounts like email, banking apps and healthcare portals. Look in account settings under \"security\" or \"login options\" to activate it. MFA ensures that even if hackers have your password, they\u2019ll need another verification method (like a text code) before accessing your account.",
      "8. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year, or more frequently if you're concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "9. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "11. Secure your online accounts: Review security settings across all important accounts (email, especially). Update recovery options like backup emails or phone numbers and log out of devices you don\u2019t recognize. Compromised accounts can lead hackers straight into other parts of your digital life.",
      "By following these steps, you\u2019ll be taking comprehensive action against potential threats stemming from the LSC data breach.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The LSC breach isn\u2019t just another headline. It\u2019s a serious reminder of how exposed we really are. When personal, medical and financial information is stolen, the consequences are immediate and long term. Identity theft, fraudulent transactions and misuse of health data are all very real risks. If your information may have been affected, act now. Review your records, freeze your credit and be vigilant.",

    "summary": "Microsoft patches 12 critical flaws, but six have already been exploited by criminals. Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says updating your system is only a short-term fix.",
    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Windows 11 is the latest and greatest operating system from Microsoft, but it has its flaws, so much so that even four years after its release, some people are sticking with older versions. Windows 10 remains the operating system of choice for many, even though Microsoft has shifted its focus entirely to Windows 11. In fact, the Redmond-based company will end security updates for Windows 10 this October.",
      "If that\u2019s not enough to push you toward upgrading, the latest news might be. The 240 million Windows 10 users are vulnerable to dozens of security vulnerabilities, six of which are reportedly already being exploited by bad actors.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "A person typing on a Windows laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Critical Windows 10 security flaws exploited",
      "The vulnerabilities in question were part of a recent Microsoft Patch Tuesday update, a monthly release where the company addresses security flaws. In this case, six specific exploits were identified as being actively used by hackers to target Windows 10 systems. These exploits are particularly alarming because they are already in the wild, meaning attackers are leveraging them to compromise systems before all users have had a chance to update their devices.",
      "The affected population, estimated at 240 million, refers to users whose PCs cannot upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations, such as lacking TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) or other system requirements.",
      "The six exploits include a mix of flaws that allow hackers to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as executing arbitrary code, escalating privileges to take full control of a system or bypassing security features.",
      "For example, one exploit might overload system memory to overwrite critical data (a buffer overflow), while another could allow attackers to access sensitive information by exploiting a flaw in the Windows Kernel. These vulnerabilities are especially dangerous because they can be triggered remotely or through seemingly innocuous actions, like opening a malicious file or mounting a compromised virtual hard disk.",
      "Windows laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "A fix is there (for now)",
      "Microsoft has released patches to address these issues, and\u00a0America\u2019s Cyber Defense Agency has urged users to update their systems immediately, ideally by this month, or risk severe consequences. The agency even suggested turning off unpatched computers as a precaution. Updating to the latest Windows 10 patch is the simplest and most effective way to protect against these exploits right now.",
      "However, a bigger problem looms later this year. Microsoft will officially end free security updates for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. After that, systems running Windows 10 will no longer receive critical security patches, unless users enroll in Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program.",
      "This ESU program will be available to individual users for the first time and will cost $30 per device for one additional year of updates. It\u2019s designed to give users more time to transition, especially those who can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations. While this offers a temporary reprieve, it's not a long-term solution; the ESU program will only extend support for a limited time (typically three years in enterprise settings) and prices may increase annually.",
      "The scale of the problem remains significant. Millions of devices lack the hardware requirements for Windows 11, such as TPM 2.0 and newer CPUs, making the shift costly or impractical for some. Analysts warn this could contribute to a surge in electronic waste, unless recycling and repurposing efforts improve dramatically.",

      "1)\u00a0Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with the latest patches, no system is entirely immune to threats. Strong antivirus software can act as a second line of defense, detecting and neutralizing malware that exploits vulnerabilities before they cause harm. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats. While this won\u2019t fix unpatched system flaws after October 2025, it can reduce risks from common attack vectors like phishing or malicious downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3) Plan for the future:\u00a0The clock is ticking on Windows 10\u2019s security updates. If your hardware can\u2019t handle Windows 11, weigh your long-term options. Buying a new PC might be inevitable, but you could also explore alternatives like Linux, which offers free, secure operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or Linux Mint) that run well on older hardware.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The road ahead for Windows 10 users is anything but smooth. With critical vulnerabilities emerging and official support coming to an end, millions are being pushed into a difficult decision. They can upgrade their hardware, pay for temporary patches or continue using increasingly vulnerable systems. As October draws closer, the risks will only increase. Updating your system is essential, but it\u2019s just a short-term measure. Now is the time to start preparing for what comes after, before the window of protection closes for good.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how robots can milk, feed and clean cows on dairy farms, boosting efficiency and comfort.",
      "Picture this: A dairy barn full of cows being milked, fed and cleaned up after, but there\u2019s no farmer in sight. Sounds a bit unusual, right? Well, it\u2019s not as far-fetched as you might think. Thanks to cutting-edge agricultural robotics, this kind of scene is becoming more common. At this farm, a team of autonomous robots is taking care of all the essential chores, completely changing the way dairy farming works.",
      "These robots aren\u2019t just doing the heavy lifting; they\u2019re creating a stress-free, comfortable environment for the cows while keeping things efficient and sustainable.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of robotic dairy farms",
      "In a dairy barn managed by robots, cows can choose to be milked whenever they like, which is often more frequent than the twice-a-day schedule in traditional farms. This increased frequency is more comfortable for the cows and can lead to roughly a 10% increase in milk production.",
      "Lely, established in 1948 in the Netherlands, introduced its first Astronaut milking robot in the early 1990s. Since then, the company has developed various robotic systems that assist with cleaning, feeding and ensuring cow comfort. Today, Lely is focused entirely on robots for dairy farms, with approximately 135,000 units deployed worldwide.",

      "HUMANOID ROBOT STUNS WITH PERFECT SIDE FLIP ACROBATICS",
      "From milking to manure: How robots lighten the load for dairy farmers",
      "Traditional dairy farms rely heavily on human labor for repetitive daily tasks, which can take up about a third of a farmer's workday. These tasks include milking, feeding and manure management. Lely's robots automate these tasks, allowing dairy farmers to focus on other aspects of their business and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The Astronaut A5 milking robot, for example, uses a laser-guided robot arm to clean the cow's udder before attaching teat cups. It also monitors milk output and collects data on 32 parameters, including milk quality and cow health indicators.",

      "CHINA'S TRON 1 ROBOT HURDLES OVER OBSTACLES LIKE IT'S NOTHING",
      "Dairy industry 4.0",
      "The introduction of milking machines in the early 1900s and rural electrification in the 1950s significantly increased farm size and milk production. Lely believes that robots will enable small dairy farms to continue scaling sustainably. While dairy robots are expensive, Lely argues that they pay for themselves over time through increased milk production and lower labor costs. Other robots, such as the Vector mobile robot for continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector, a robotic manure vacuum, further reduce labor needs.",
      "AI also plays a critical role in optimizing feeding systems, reducing waste and improving sustainability, which are key factors in modern dairy farming. Wearable technology and smart sensors are also becoming increasingly important tools in herd health monitoring, offering farmers real-time insights into cow well-being and productivity.",

      "SCARY AI-POWERED SWARM ROBOTS TEAM UP TO BUILD CARS FASTER THAN EVER",
      "Cows vs robots",
      "Cows are curious animals and tend to interact with robots. Lely has had to cow-proof its robots to ensure they can function autonomously around cows. This includes modifying the robots' design and programming, such as adding contact-sensing bumpers and relocating emergency stop buttons. Engineers have also had to consider the social dynamics within a herd. For example, the Discovery Collector robot had to be programmed to assert its dominance within the herd to avoid being blocked by cows.",
      "Lely recognizes the importance of designing robots that are not only functional but also trustworthy and reliable. Jan Jacobs emphasizes that the robots are not intended to be friends with the cows or the farmers but rather professional employees.",

      "From dairy farmers to robot managers",
      "Lely is working to integrate its robots seamlessly into the daily lives of dairy farmers, who are increasingly becoming robot managers. This requires farmers to manage the robots and learn how to interpret the data they generate. The additional time and flexibility afforded by robots have allowed some dairy farmers to diversify their operations. One Lely customer, for example, has added a restaurant and farm shop to his dairy, allowing patrons to observe the robots at work while enjoying cheese made from the cows they care for.",
      "Lely helps farmers prepare for the shift to robotic dairy farming, both in terms of the physical environment and their mindset. This includes managing the massive amount of data generated by the robots and using it for long-term optimization.",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Flexibility and sustainability",
      "Many dairy farms are adopting robots to decrease their dependence on hired help and gain greater flexibility. Farmers report that robots have allowed them to prioritize their personal lives and spend more quality time with their families. Robots also contribute to the long-term viability of smaller dairy farms by making the profession more appealing to younger generations. The reduced workload and commitment associated with robotic farming make it a more attractive career path.",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Price",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "So, what's the future of dairy farming look like? It seems like robots are poised to play a huge role, helping farmers work smarter, not harder. It's interesting to think about how these technologies will continue to evolve and shape the industry in the years to come.",
      "At the end of the day, dairy farming is about people and animals. While robots can handle many of the repetitive tasks, it's the farmer's knowledge and care that truly make a difference. These technologies are tools, and how farmers use them will determine the future of their farms and the well-being of their herds. It's definitely a blend of the old and the new for dairy farmers who are purchasing these robots.",

      "Rendelman stressed that the public does not know all the facts in the case, but said that, given what she's read, Anthony does not have a clear-cut self-defense claim.",
      "\"If the scenario is\u2026 that the victim told [Anthony] to leave, and then in some way physically touched him without more, then I'm not comfortable \u2013 I don't believe that a self-defense claim will work,\" she said.",

They reduced it with the ankle monitor, with the housing confinement limited to going to\u2026 necessary appointments, [and] that he has to report [to the judge]. So it wasn't a reduction without any conditions.\"",
      "She also addressed the widening divide between those who support Metcalf and those who support Anthony. The case has become a flash point partly because of a GiveSendGo fundraiser for the suspected killer, which has accrued nearly $500,000 in donations.",
      "\"I feel incredible sympathy for the victim's family,\" Rendelman said. \"Because no matter how you look at it, he's still a 17-year-old boy who was kind of at the beginning of his life.\"",

      "\"Quinn\u2019s a minimalist,\" Marsteiner said. \"He just takes his bike out. That's a common thing. A lot of people do that. They don't think anything of it. But the temperatures at night can drop, even in July, to [around] 45 degrees, and it\u2019s potentially a rainy season.",

    "summary": "A California trial lawyer breaks down an analysis of what the judge in the Menendez brothers resentencing hearings is considering when factoring in a potential prison release.",
    "story": [
      "A California legal analyst and trial lawyer says there are many factors a judge will consider on whether Erik and Lyle Menendez are fit to be released from prison.",
      "LOS ANGELES \u2013 As the fate of the Menendez brothers is paused for another month, a legal analyst and trial lawyer says the fact that their freedom is even a discussion is thanks to a new law signed in by Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Roger Bonakdar, a California-based attorney, shared with Fox News Digital that after nearly 35 years behind bars, Erik and Lyle Menendez were given new hope to leave prison behind thanks to former Los Angeles County George Gascon and the passing of AB 600.",
      "The law allows individuals who remain incarcerated under sentences that were imposed when harsher, less flexible laws were in effect, to petition for a review of their sentences, so they can benefit from more recent legislative reforms that focus on rehabilitation, according to the law's text.",
      "\"What's happening is that the prior DA Gascon, infamous for certain policies and practices that he instituted in LA County which many credit with the explosion of violent crime and theft in LA, had filed a motion with the court to have the Menendez brothers re-sentenced,\" Bonakdar explained.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS CASE: WHAT'S NEXT FOR KILLERS AFTER DEFENSE, DA SPAR OVER RESENTENCING",
      "Lyle, left, and Erik Menendez sit with defense attorney Leslie Abramson, right, in Beverly Hills Municipal Court during a hearing, Nov. 26, 1990.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Nick Ut)",
      "Bonakdar said that Gascon's argument was that the Menendez brothers are \"allegedly no longer a threat to the community and that they've served their debt to society,\" because of their ages at the time of their conviction and sentence.",
      "\"Gascon also apparently made a point of their defense, which didn't fly at trial, about their alleged sexual abuse at the hands of their now-murdered father. So, what's happening now is that the current DA has sought leave of court to withdraw or to take back Gascon's motion because he doesn't believe that the Menendez brothers are worthy or deserving of re-sentencing, and that's what's before the court.\"",
      "Bonakdar said what makes this hearing even more interesting is that the judge's powers are \"pretty broad\" and he can \"re-sentence them based on an offense that they weren't convicted of.\"",
      "\"The judge can even sentence them according to what is called a lesser included offense. That means an offense that acts are part of, or otherwise included in, the charge they went to trial on, which could include second-degree murder, even voluntary manslaughter, arguably under the statute. I would imagine the judge would be hard-pressed to go that far. But the powers that are given to a judge under the new statute are pretty sweeping. His discretion is very broad.\"",
      "The Menendez brothers and their supporters have been pushing for a resentencing hearing, saying the brothers were unfairly convicted to life in prison in 1996 for murdering their two parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS ATTORNEY'S FOCUS ON GRISLY PHOTOS PART OF STRATEGIC DEFENSE PLAY TO FREE KILLERS: EXPERTS",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez are seen as young men with their mugshots overlayed. The brothers are currently serving life sentences for the murders of their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Mary Louise \"Kitty\" Menendez in 1996.\u00a0 (Ronald L. Soble/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)",
      "Their first trial ended in a mistrial, when jurors couldn't agree on their fate. After a second trial in the mid-1990s, in which some of their evidence about the alleged sexual abuse was excluded, jurors agreed with prosecutors that their motive was greed.",
      "If the judge decides to resentence the Menendez brothers, it will then be up to the state parole board to consider their release.",
      "Because they were under 26 years old at the time of the murders, under current California law, new sentences of 50 years to life would immediately make them eligible for a parole hearing.",
      "\"If this goes fully their way, they could be granted parole and be released. Their sentence could be commuted,\" Bonakdar said. \"And the reason for that is there have been certain changes in California law which allow certain offenders, if they were young enough at the time they were convicted to seek re-sentencing under these compassionate release rules that say that, for example, if you were under the age of 26 at the the time of the commission, or if you had certain other mitigating circumstances, you're eligible to apply to the court for relief.\"",
      "Bonakdar added that what's unique here is that Gascon affirmatively filed for the relief, and that the judge rejected current DA Nathan Hochman's attempt to pull back Gascon's motion.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS' AUNT HOSPITALIZED AFTER DA SHARES GRAPHIC PHOTOS IN COURT: 'THERE WAS NO WARNING'",
      "\"This is pretty important because under the new law, it says that where the government, where the prosecutor moves for the release, it actually entitles the defendant, the convict, to the benefit of a presumption, meaning that the person who's seeking the reduction of sentence starts off with a presumptive that they are eligible or that they should be granted parole. So that's something that's pretty unique and is not clear from what the judge ruled when rejecting Hochman's request to withdraw that initial motion,\" Bonakdar said.",
      "What also sets this whole hearing and saga apart from others is that the Menendez brothers \"definitely have a leg up over your average criminal defendant,\" Bonakdar said.",

      "\"First of all, obviously they had resources going into this. They had hired top flight lawyers. They threw everything in the kitchen sink at this trial,\" Bonakdar said about their trials in the '90s. \"They went the distance and even testified in their criminal trials. So it's not surprising that a defendant who had that level of resources and put in that level of effort might be seeking relief now.\"",
      "Bonakdar said that the biggest thing, though, is that Gascon affirmatively filed the motion.",
      "\"There is the argument that these defendants could have sought the clemency otherwise or filed a motion based on the change in the statute. The fact that Gascon, the former district attorney, filed this independently and affirmatively on behalf of these defendants really gives them a leg up going into the hearing. Most other defendants won't have that benefit,\" Bonakdar explained.",

      "Hochman has strongly opposed the resentencing, put in motion by Gascon, but said he would consider it if both brothers \"sincerely and unequivocally admit, for the first time in over 30 years, the full range of their criminal activity and all the lies that they have told about it.\"",
      "He said in a previous statement that the brothers \"have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials,\" and that it's up to the court to factor in whether the \"lack of acceptance of responsibility for their murderous actions\" is enough to decide whether the Menendez brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.",
      "Bonakdar said, in his opinion and viewpoint, that there are \"aggravating factors out there that the judge could consider and probably should\" before making his decision in May.",
      "\"Premeditated murder is an extremely serious and obviously by its nature, violent offense. And particularly, if you've got the mental ability to process the idea of murdering both your parents in cold blood, that's a grave public safety concern,\" Bonakdar said. \"The arguments on the other side are that at some point, time does heal wounds and that people can be rehabilitated and everyone is worthy of redemption. This is the argument that will be made on behalf of the Menendez brothers. While that may be true in some instances, I guess that remains to be seen for the Men\u00e9ndez boys.\"",

      "Francis died Monday at age 88, the Vatican announced.",
      "While much of the tradition associated with papal funerals \u2013 which dates all the way back to ancient Rome \u2013 will continue, matters such as Francis' coffin structure, his death verification process, burial location, and how he will be viewed and referred to during the ceremony, will be different from how it has been in the past.",

      "Pope Francis greets cardinals as he unexpectedly appears during the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican, April 13, 2025. (Yara Nardi/Reuters)",
      "Francis' move to change these papal funeral traditions, some of which date all the way back to ancient Rome, stemmed from a desire to emphasize that the pope is \"that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world,\" according to Archbishop Diego Ravelli, the head of\u00a0papal liturgical ceremonies who reportedly worked with Francis to help make the revisions. The rewrite was also preceded by the unusual circumstances of Pope Benedict XVI's funeral, which deviated from traditional papal funerals on account of the fact he was a retired pope rather than a reigning one.",
      "The new funeral rites were formally approved by Francis in 2023 and were later published in the church's liturgical guidelines in early 2024. Around the same time he was working on these revisions, the pope revealed during an interview with a Spanish-language broadcaster that he would not be buried in the grottoes of the Vatican like his predecessors, but rather at Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome. The new papal rights make it permissible for future popes to be buried outside the Vatican as well.",
      "POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS",
      "In addition to the different burial location, the new papal funeral rites have amended the way the pope will be viewed by the public following his death. In the past, the pope's body would be displayed on an elevated frame known as a bier. But, under the new funeral structure, the pope will be laid directly into an open coffin, eliminating the use of the bier. Pope Francis also eliminated the practice of being buried in three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.",
      "The location of where Francis would be declared deceased changed too. It went from taking place in the papal bedroom to now inside the papal chapel located at the Vatican. The new rules also require that Pope Francis' remains be immediately put into a simplistic wooden-lined coffin after he is determined to have passed.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time since Hamas seized power 18 years ago, Gazans are speaking out against Hamas at great personal risk, Fox News' Mike Tobin reports.",
      "Amid Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign against Hamas terrorists in Gaza, the terror group is reportedly facing an unprecedented financial crisis.",
      "Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that salary payments to many Hamas government employees have ceased, and even senior officials received only half of their usual pay during Ramadan. Terrorists, who once earned $200 to $300 a month, are struggling to get paid as the IDF tightens its grip, and the flow of humanitarian aid has been cut off since the collapse of the ceasefire.",
      "Dr. Michael Milstein, head\u00a0of the Forum for\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that while financial difficulties are mounting, Hamas operatives are motivated more by ideology than money. \"It\u2019s not just about a paycheck,\" Milstein said. \"Hamas provides essential supplies like food, water and medical care to families, which is crucial in today\u2019s Gaza.\" Despite the squeeze, Milstein noted that Hamas has weathered similar financial crises in the past without collapsing.",

      "Israeli troops encircle Tel al-Sultan in Gaza.\u00a0 (IDF)",
      "\"Two days ago, the IDF killed the battalion commander of the Sajia area for the fifth time. Today, there\u2019s a new battalion commander. They fill the ranks. Hamas had 25,000 military operatives on October 7, and today it has a similar number, even though it lost twenty thousand. They manage with fewer experienced operatives, including children recruited from refugee camps, but manpower is always available in Gaza. As for weapons other than rockets, there is no problem\u2014RPGs, explosives, and rifles are available,\" Milstein added.",
      "Mkhaimar Abusada, a Gazan political analyst and currently a visiting scholar at Northwestern University, emphasized that Hamas will likely find ways to recover. \"Hamas has survived despite external financial pressures for nearly two decades,\" Abusada said. \"They\u2019ve bypassed sanctions and continue to exploit black market activities and taxes on merchants.\" While money may not drive Hamas fighters, Abusada suggested that the financial squeeze would complicate their operations but not lead to the group's collapse.",
      "Protesters spoke out against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. (Fox News)",
      "Before the war, according to the same Wall Street Journal article, Qatar provided Hamas with monthly transfers of $15 million, helping to build a stockpile of around $500 million, much of it stored in Turkey. However,\u00a0Israel\u2019s tightened blockade\u00a0has limited access to these funds, forcing Hamas to rely on new income sources, such as black-market activities and taxes. \"Still, Hamas continues to manage through illicit financial flows, circumventing Israel, U.S., and international sanctions with relative ease,\" Abusada said.",
      "Amid the financial crisis, protests against Hamas have started to gain traction. Initially small, demonstrations in Gaza City and surrounding areas have called for an end to Hamas\u2019 rule, with some protesters shouting, \"Hamas out!\" Abusada noted that these protests, originally anti-war and anti-Israel, have taken on anti-Hamas slogans. However, Hamas has responded violently. \"Hamas has made it clear that dissent will be crushed,\" he said, adding that some protesters have been tortured to death for their involvement.",

      "Milstein said that while protests show unrest, they lack leadership and organization. \"Hamas has violently suppressed protests, and if this continues, they may die out,\" he said, pointing to a recent protest in Beit Lahiya that quickly dwindled.",

This is part of Israel Katz\u2019s Ministry of Defense plan to encourage those who wish to permanently relocate, aligning with President Trump\u2019s vision for the relocation of Gazans.",
      "\"The destruction of homes, schools, and hospitals, along with a lack of basic needs, has driven many to leave Gaza,\" Abusada said. \"But options are limited\u2014Europe is not open to large numbers of refugees from Gaza.\"",

    "story": [
      "From working as a bouncer at a Buenos Aires nightclub to presiding over the Vatican, the path Pope Francis forged as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was as unlikely as it was unprecedented.",
      "Francis, who died Monday at age 88, was keen to flex his muscles as supreme pontiff. He angered some Catholic Church traditionalists by reaching out to gay and marginalized people, demanding justice for the poor and the dispossessed and railing against unbridled capitalism and climate change.",
      "As the first pope from the Americas, Francis was in many ways the ultimate Vatican outsider who charted a new and more liberal course as the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "\u201cHe embarked on a real reorganization of the church, and a real reorientation of the church, after four decades of conservative theologians leading the way,\u201d said David Gibson, director of the Fordham Center on Religion and Culture.",
      "Case in point: Francis announced a radical change in Vatican policy in December 2023 by formally allowing priests to bless same-sex couples. Still, he continued to oppose gay marriage, to the dismay of more liberal Catholics.",
      "Francis also ratcheted up action against the sexual abuse of children by Catholic Church clergy by issuing the most extensive revision to its law in four decades, calling it \u201cour shame.\u201d",
      "And Francis steadfastly championed the plight of migrants at a time when many countries across the globe, including the United States, were closing their borders and right-wing politicians were demonizing them.",
      "\u201cWe cannot remain indifferent in the face of such human dramas,\u201d the pope said in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in May 2024. \u201cThe globalization of indifference is a very ugly disease. Very ugly.\u201d",
      "Francis pointedly criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt, during his first term in office, to prevent migrants fleeing violence in Central America from getting into the U.S. by building a wall on the  border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cI realize that with this problem, a government has a hot potato in its hands, but it must be resolved differently, humanely, not with razor wire,\u201d Francis insisted.",
      "But in doing so, Francis alienated many Catholics and Republicans in the United States who supported Trump and his border wall.",
      "To be sure, Francis was also criticized by the church's progressive wing. He refused to consider ordaining women. Victims of sexual abuse said his changes weren't strong enough. And he was accused last year of using a highly offensive term to describe gay men in a closed-door meeting, two weeks after the Vatican apologized for his use of the same slur.",
      "Francis faced the stiffest resistance from archconservative American clerics during the pandemic when he urged people to get vaccinated against Covid. He also found himself being accused of heresy for, among other things, softening the ban on giving Communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.",
      "Still, in many ways, Francis was cut from the same conservative clerical cloth as his predecessors Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict. He was against abortion, in favor of clerical celibacy and opposed to ordaining women, although he was open to giving them a greater role in running the church.",
      "It was Francis, after all, who gave final approval to make John Paul II, a religiously conservative Pole and another pontiff from \u201ca faraway land,\u201d a saint.",
      "Despite Francis\u2019 attempts to weed out sex abusers from the clerical ranks, many victims did not believe he went far enough to address the problem and punish offenders."

      "The dispute is the latest in a long line of cases concerning the 2010 health care law \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement \u2014 which Republicans have relentlessly attacked in court as they have repeatedly tried and failed to repeal it. The Supreme Court narrowly upheld the bulk of the law in a major 2012 ruling.",
      "Ironically, on this occasion, the Trump administration is defending the provision after taking over the case from the Biden administration.",
      "The government argued that the task force members are lawfully appointed because they are ultimately under the supervision of the health and human services secretary, a position currently held by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which addresses any concerns that it is not accountable to the executive branch.",
      "As such, they do not exercise the kind of power that \u201cprincipal officers\u201d do and therefore do not need to be Senate-confirmed, government lawyers say.",
      "Even if the court were to find that the panel is unconstitutionally appointed, it could resolve the issue by finding that it is not independent and that its actions must be approved by the HHS secretary. The court took a similar approach in a 2021 case about in-house judges at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "If the Trump administration prevails on that point, then Kennedy and other officials would have greater control over the task force.",
      "The challengers argue there is no basis for the court to remedy the constitutional problem in the way the government suggests, with their lawyer describing the proposal as \u201cunlawful for many reasons,\u201d in part because it gives the HHS secretary powers that are not outlined in the statute.",
      "After the lawsuit was filed in 2020, a federal judge in Texas issued a ruling that said the structure of the task force was unconstitutional and all of its decisions should be considered invalid nationwide.",
      "The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed that ruling somewhat. The Biden administration then took the case to the Supreme Court."

    "summary": "Almost no NFL players have competed on both defense and offense. Colorado star Travis Hunter wants to change that.",
    "story": [
      "Colorado\u2019s Travis Hunter has a message for the NFL and the team that plans to select him in Thursday\u2019s draft: Don\u2019t tell me I can\u2019t do it.",
      "Hunter made history at the University of Colorado last season not just for his unicorn role \u2014 starting at both cornerback and wide receiver \u2014 but for his prolific success doing so. And he has the hardware to show it, having won the prestigious Heisman Trophy, as well as awards for most outstanding receiver and defensive player of the year.",
      "Expected to be one of the first names called by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Hunter has been at the center of a massive debate among football insiders and draft obsessives about how teams should best use his incredible talents while also protecting their significant investment.",
      "To Hunter, the answer is clear, one he has repeated for months whenever he\u2019s asked what position he\u2019ll play in the NFL: \u201cI do both.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey say nobody has ever done it for real, the way that I do it. But I tell them I\u2019m just different, I\u2019m a different person,\u201d Hunter told reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine in February. \u201cI know I can do it.\u201d",
      "Hunter paved new ground during his Heisman season, becoming the first winner to play meaningful snaps on both sides of the ball since Michigan\u2019s Charles Woodson in 1997. But while Woodson, recognized as one of the best defensive backs in football history, had 14 touches and three touchdowns on offense to go along with seven interceptions that year, Hunter\u2019s 2024 was on another level.",
      "Hunter played more than 90% of Colorado\u2019s offensive and defensive snaps, according to the school (excluding injury) \u2014 finishing in the top five nationally for receptions and receiving touchdowns, all while cementing his status as a shutdown man-to-man corner (his 11 pass deflections were tied for 14th nationally).",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an argument for him as the No. 1 overall pick, whatever position you want, which is kind of insane,\u201d said Connor Rogers, an NBC Sports NFL draft analyst. \u201cWe always love the clich\u00e9 of [a player] keeping a coordinator up all night. The fact that Hunter can legitimately do that on both ends of the ball, not just be average at one and great at another, is pretty, pretty unique stuff.\u201d",
      "The spotlight has followed Hunter since his high school days, when he was one of the nation\u2019s top recruits, playing both offense and defense on a state championship-winning team in Georgia.",
      "Lenny Gregory, who coached Hunter at Collins Hill High School, told NBC News that he immediately realized Hunter was \"special\" the first time he went to practice as an incoming freshman after having recently moved to the area. Despite having missed all of offseason training, he \"smoked every kid\" during the on-field conditioning test, a performance Gregory said he had never seen before. Months later, he was already telling scouts visiting campus that this ninth grader might be the best player in the country.",
      "\"There are a lot of kids who say they love football, but to really love football, you've got to show up every day and you've got to work. This dude not only says he loves football; he never missed nothing,\" Gregory said. \"His footwork, his ability to catch a ball, it's just different. He's really special. People don't have the passion for the game like this kid does.\"",
      "Having initially committed to Florida State, he flipped his commitment to Jackson State, a historically Black university, to join its new coach, Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. He transferred to Colorado when Sanders took the head coaching job there.",
      "Hunter and Sanders\u2019 son Shedeur (one of the top quarterbacks in this year\u2019s draft) were the stars of Sanders\u2019 attempt to put Colorado football back on the map. Injuries slowed Hunter down a bit in 2023, but he fully broke out last year.",

      "Quarterbacks were the hottest commodity in last year's NFL draft. Now they're the biggest question.",
      "Lee Corso to retire from ESPN's 'College GameDay' after 38 seasons",
      "Aaron Rodgers remains undecided on NFL future: 'I'm open to anything'",
      "He showed the big-play ability that makes him a threat on both sides of the ball, eclipsing 100 yards receiving in eight games and scoring multiple touchdowns in five. Along with his four interceptions, he also forced a timely fumble that won the Buffaloes a game against Baylor in overtime.",
      "Analysts like Rogers are enamored with that home run threat and how it transfers across offense and defense.",
      "\u201cHe could flip the game at any moment \u2014 he could just find the ball and take away the football at any given moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you could do that on any given touch on offense but then on any given throw on defense, that\u2019s pretty unique,\u201d he said.",
      "But while his athleticism and skills are clear, how exactly they should transfer to the NFL isn\u2019t.",
      "Can his body hold up to the extreme physical demands of playing one position, let alone two? Will spending time analyzing film and game-planning for full-time roles on both sides of the ball limit his upside given the NFL\u2019s steep learning curve? Would it be better for him to prioritize one position and play a handful of high-leverage snaps on the other side of the ball?",
      "Even some top executives in the mix to draft Hunter don\u2019t fully agree, and it's possible where he lines up on the field might depend on what the team that drafts him needs more: an impact wide receiver or cornerback.",
      "Cleveland Browns general manager Andrew Berry said during the NFL combine that while \u201cpart of what makes him a bit of a unicorn is the fact he can do both at a high level,\u201d the Browns would \u201csee him as a receiver primarily\u201d because his main threat is his \u201cball skills.\u201d\u00a0But as the draft drew closer, Berry praised Hunter's elite conditioning and compared his potential two-way ability to that of Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar pitcher and designated hitter.",
      "\"You obviously get a unicorn if you use him both ways,\" Berry said.",
      "Tennessee Titans coach Brian Callahan, speaking at the combine, praised Hunter as a \u201cunique player,\u201d adding that he \u201cprobably starts at corner, and then you find ways to inject him into the offense as he gets more comfortable.\u201d",
      "And New York Giants general manager Joe Schoen said last week that if Hunter \"gets hurt doing something that he\u2019s not doing full time, you\u2019re going to kick yourself. But he\u2019s a unique athlete that I think will be able to do both.\u201d",
      "Former Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars coach Mike Mularkey told NBC News that one challenge for Hunter no matter where he plays will be the learning curve \u2014 \u201chow fast and how physical and how violent the NFL is compared to college.\u201d",
      "Mularkey coached in the NFL for 25 years. He earned the nickname \u201cInspector Gadget\u201d for his unique ability to use athletic talents like former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receivers Hines Ward and Antwaan Randle El, who both played some quarterback in college before they entered the league. Mularkey was also instrumental in coaching two-way player Adoree' Jackson, a first-round pick who also played both defensive back and some receiver at Southern California.",
      "Mularkey recalled that the Titans used Jackson primarily on defense but created a handful of offensive packages to leverage his game-breaking ability. He said part of the decision was to not overload Jackson physically in his first season as a professional.",
      "It\u2019s instructive about how he thinks Hunter\u2019s NFL team should handle him \u2014 pick a primary position, allow him to get used to it and then create abilities for him to make an impact on the other side of the ball.",
      "\u201cI would do it just like I did Adoree' \u2014 let him be really good at one thing and use those skills on the other side in a handful of plays,\u201d Mularkey said. \u201cIf he\u2019s a receiver and you want to put him [on defense] as a nickel cover guy because maybe there\u2019s a tight end like a [Travis] Kelce or somebody, he needs to cover one on one. But don\u2019t put everything on his plate on both sides, or he\u2019s not going to be as good at either phase. Let him be really good at one, and he can be a threat in the other.\u201d",
      "The question continues to swirl as the draft draws nearer. As far as Hunter\u2019s concerned, it has been asked and answered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to figure it out,\u201d he said at the NFL combine. \u201cIf they give me the opportunity to play both sides of the ball, I\u2019m going to play both sides.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/travis-hunter-nfl-draft-offense-defense-rcna200534",
    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:03:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Almost no NFL players have competed on both defense and offense. Colorado star Travis Hunter wants to change that.",
    "story": [
      "Colorado\u2019s Travis Hunter has a message for the NFL and the team that plans to select him in Thursday\u2019s draft: Don\u2019t tell me I can\u2019t do it.",
      "Hunter made history at the University of Colorado last season not just for his unicorn role \u2014 starting at both cornerback and wide receiver \u2014 but for his prolific success doing so. And he has the hardware to show it, having won the prestigious Heisman Trophy, as well as awards for most outstanding receiver and defensive player of the year.",
      "Expected to be one of the first names called by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Hunter has been at the center of a massive debate among football insiders and draft obsessives about how teams should best use his incredible talents while also protecting their significant investment.",
      "To Hunter, the answer is clear, one he has repeated for months whenever he\u2019s asked what position he\u2019ll play in the NFL: \u201cI do both.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey say nobody has ever done it for real, the way that I do it. But I tell them I\u2019m just different, I\u2019m a different person,\u201d Hunter told reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine in February. \u201cI know I can do it.\u201d",
      "Hunter paved new ground during his Heisman season, becoming the first winner to play meaningful snaps on both sides of the ball since Michigan\u2019s Charles Woodson in 1997. But while Woodson, recognized as one of the best defensive backs in football history, had 14 touches and three touchdowns on offense to go along with seven interceptions that year, Hunter\u2019s 2024 was on another level.",
      "Hunter played more than 90% of Colorado\u2019s offensive and defensive snaps, according to the school (excluding injury) \u2014 finishing in the top five nationally for receptions and receiving touchdowns, all while cementing his status as a shutdown man-to-man corner (his 11 pass deflections were tied for 14th nationally).",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an argument for him as the No. 1 overall pick, whatever position you want, which is kind of insane,\u201d said Connor Rogers, an NBC Sports NFL draft analyst. \u201cWe always love the clich\u00e9 of [a player] keeping a coordinator up all night. The fact that Hunter can legitimately do that on both ends of the ball, not just be average at one and great at another, is pretty, pretty unique stuff.\u201d",
      "The spotlight has followed Hunter since his high school days, when he was one of the nation\u2019s top recruits, playing both offense and defense on a state championship-winning team in Georgia.",
      "Lenny Gregory, who coached Hunter at Collins Hill High School, told NBC News that he immediately realized Hunter was \"special\" the first time he went to practice as an incoming freshman after having recently moved to the area. Despite having missed all of offseason training, he \"smoked every kid\" during the on-field conditioning test, a performance Gregory said he had never seen before. Months later, he was already telling scouts visiting campus that this ninth grader might be the best player in the country.",
      "\"There are a lot of kids who say they love football, but to really love football, you've got to show up every day and you've got to work. This dude not only says he loves football; he never missed nothing,\" Gregory said. \"His footwork, his ability to catch a ball, it's just different. He's really special. People don't have the passion for the game like this kid does.\"",
      "Having initially committed to Florida State, he flipped his commitment to Jackson State, a historically Black university, to join its new coach, Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. He transferred to Colorado when Sanders took the head coaching job there.",
      "Hunter and Sanders\u2019 son Shedeur (one of the top quarterbacks in this year\u2019s draft) were the stars of Sanders\u2019 attempt to put Colorado football back on the map. Injuries slowed Hunter down a bit in 2023, but he fully broke out last year.",

      "Quarterbacks were the hottest commodity in last year's NFL draft. Now they're the biggest question.",
      "Lee Corso to retire from ESPN's 'College GameDay' after 38 seasons",
      "Aaron Rodgers remains undecided on NFL future: 'I'm open to anything'",
      "He showed the big-play ability that makes him a threat on both sides of the ball, eclipsing 100 yards receiving in eight games and scoring multiple touchdowns in five. Along with his four interceptions, he also forced a timely fumble that won the Buffaloes a game against Baylor in overtime.",
      "Analysts like Rogers are enamored with that home run threat and how it transfers across offense and defense.",
      "\u201cHe could flip the game at any moment \u2014 he could just find the ball and take away the football at any given moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you could do that on any given touch on offense but then on any given throw on defense, that\u2019s pretty unique,\u201d he said.",
      "But while his athleticism and skills are clear, how exactly they should transfer to the NFL isn\u2019t.",
      "Can his body hold up to the extreme physical demands of playing one position, let alone two? Will spending time analyzing film and game-planning for full-time roles on both sides of the ball limit his upside given the NFL\u2019s steep learning curve? Would it be better for him to prioritize one position and play a handful of high-leverage snaps on the other side of the ball?",
      "Even some top executives in the mix to draft Hunter don\u2019t fully agree, and it's possible where he lines up on the field might depend on what the team that drafts him needs more: an impact wide receiver or cornerback.",
      "Cleveland Browns general manager Andrew Berry said during the NFL combine that while \u201cpart of what makes him a bit of a unicorn is the fact he can do both at a high level,\u201d the Browns would \u201csee him as a receiver primarily\u201d because his main threat is his \u201cball skills.\u201d\u00a0But as the draft drew closer, Berry praised Hunter's elite conditioning and compared his potential two-way ability to that of Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar pitcher and designated hitter.",
      "\"You obviously get a unicorn if you use him both ways,\" Berry said.",
      "Tennessee Titans coach Brian Callahan, speaking at the combine, praised Hunter as a \u201cunique player,\u201d adding that he \u201cprobably starts at corner, and then you find ways to inject him into the offense as he gets more comfortable.\u201d",
      "And New York Giants general manager Joe Schoen said last week that if Hunter \"gets hurt doing something that he\u2019s not doing full time, you\u2019re going to kick yourself. But he\u2019s a unique athlete that I think will be able to do both.\u201d",
      "Former Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars coach Mike Mularkey told NBC News that one challenge for Hunter no matter where he plays will be the learning curve \u2014 \u201chow fast and how physical and how violent the NFL is compared to college.\u201d",
      "Mularkey coached in the NFL for 25 years. He earned the nickname \u201cInspector Gadget\u201d for his unique ability to use athletic talents like former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receivers Hines Ward and Antwaan Randle El, who both played some quarterback in college before they entered the league. Mularkey was also instrumental in coaching two-way player Adoree' Jackson, a first-round pick who also played both defensive back and some receiver at Southern California.",
      "Mularkey recalled that the Titans used Jackson primarily on defense but created a handful of offensive packages to leverage his game-breaking ability. He said part of the decision was to not overload Jackson physically in his first season as a professional.",
      "It\u2019s instructive about how he thinks Hunter\u2019s NFL team should handle him \u2014 pick a primary position, allow him to get used to it and then create abilities for him to make an impact on the other side of the ball.",
      "\u201cI would do it just like I did Adoree' \u2014 let him be really good at one thing and use those skills on the other side in a handful of plays,\u201d Mularkey said. \u201cIf he\u2019s a receiver and you want to put him [on defense] as a nickel cover guy because maybe there\u2019s a tight end like a [Travis] Kelce or somebody, he needs to cover one on one. But don\u2019t put everything on his plate on both sides, or he\u2019s not going to be as good at either phase. Let him be really good at one, and he can be a threat in the other.\u201d",
      "The question continues to swirl as the draft draws nearer. As far as Hunter\u2019s concerned, it has been asked and answered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to figure it out,\u201d he said at the NFL combine. \u201cIf they give me the opportunity to play both sides of the ball, I\u2019m going to play both sides.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Five years ago, Oscar-winning Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of third-degree rape following one of the landmark trials of the #MeToo era. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison.",
      "But that was not the end of his legal saga.",
      "In a stunning turn of events last year, Weinstein\u2019s conviction was thrown out by a New York appeals court. The decision paved the way for a new trial, which started this week with jury selection.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Weinstein\u2019s retrial, and how we got here.",
      "What happened in Weinstein\u2019s first trial?",
      "In late February 2020, a New York jury convicted Weinstein of one count of rape in the third degree of Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, and one count of criminal sexual act in the first degree against Mimi Haley, a former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant.",
      "He was found not guilty on two counts of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape against Mann.",
      "Weinstein had pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.",
      "The trial was one of the most pivotal episodes of the #MeToo era, a reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful people in various high-profile industries that began with a wave of allegations against Weinstein in 2017.",
      "In early March 2020, a judge sentenced Weinstein to three years behind bars for third-degree rape and 20 years for first-degree criminal sexual act. The judge ruled that the former producer must serve his sentences consecutively.",
      "Why was Weinstein\u2019s conviction overturned?",
      "In late April 2024, New York\u2019s highest court overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction. The court found that the trial judge had improperly allowed testimony against the former Miramax chief based on allegations that were not part of the case.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose,\u201d the court said in a 4-3 decision.",
      "Judge Jenny Rivera called the errors \u201cegregious\u201d and said the legal remedy was a new trial.",
      "Weinstein has remained in prison because he was convicted in 2022 of another rape in Los Angeles, and sentenced to 16 years.",
      "What is the focus of Weinstein\u2019s second trial?",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial will resemble the original proceedings in certain key ways. He will be retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on Haley, the former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant, in 2006, and raped Mann, the former aspiring actress, in 2013.",
      "But there will be an important addition. Weinstein faces an additional count of first-degree criminal sexual act based on an allegation from an unnamed woman who was not part of the first trial. The woman alleges he forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Weinstein has again pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "What about his health?",
      "In recent years, Weinstein has faced myriad health issues. He has been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, an uncommon form of bone marrow cancer, two sources told NBC News in October. The sources said he was undergoing treatment at New York\u2019s Rikers Island prison.",
      "This week, a state Supreme Court judge granted Weinstein\u2019s lawyers\u2019 request to have their client transferred from Rikers to Bellevue Hospital. He will be allowed to stay there until his trial is over.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers had described Rikers in harsh terms, saying he was \u201cconsistently mistreated for serious infections, medication is given incorrectly, or not at all, he is experiencing unhealthy and atypical weight gain, and he is forced to endure freezing temperatures while not even being provided clean clothing.\u201d",
      "The former producer underwent emergency heart surgery in September. The procedure was meant to alleviate a significant amount of fluid in his lungs and heart. It came months after he was hospitalized and tested positive for Covid-19 and double pneumonia.",
      "Weinstein, who is usually taken into court in a wheelchair, turned 73 on March 19.",
      "Why was he such a major figure in Hollywood?",
      "Weinstein was one of the towering figures in the American film industry in the 1990s and 2000s. He and his brother, Bob, ran Miramax, the distributor of seminal independent movies like \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape,\u201d \u201cThe Crying Game,\u201d \u201cClerks\u201d and \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d",
      "He won a best picture Oscar in 1999 as one of the producers of \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d In the early 2010s, Weinstein\u2019s second distribution label, The Weinstein Company, scored back-to-back best picture victories for \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Artist.\u201d",
      "Weinstein earned a reputation in Hollywood as both a savvy tastemaker and a ruthless operator. He was known for using bare-knuckle tactics in convincing filmmakers to obey his creative edicts and promoting his companies\u2019 films during awards season.",
      "In all, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual assault or harassment going back decades. He has repeatedly denied the claims, insisting the encounters were consensual."

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday weighs a challenge to a panel set up as part of the Obamacare health law to recommend preventive care services that insurers have to provide at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday weighs a challenge to a panel set up as part of the Affordable Care Act to recommend preventive care services that insurers have to provide at no cost to patients.",
      "The case arose from a challenge brought by Christian employers Braidwood Management and Kelley Orthodontics, in addition to several individuals, who objected on religious grounds to the Preventive Services Task Force approving no-cost coverage for the HIV prevention medication known as PrEP.",
      "The plaintiffs believe their religious rights are violated \u201cby making them complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman,\u201d according to court papers.",
      "The case at the Supreme Court does not hinge on the religious questions raised under the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.",
      "At issue is whether the Preventive Services Task Force \u2014 which recommends a wide array of preventive services related to such issues as cancer, diabetes and heart disease \u2014 is unconstitutionally structured.",
      "The challenges say it violates the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause because its members are not nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "A broad ruling in favor of Braidwood would have a significant impact, as the task force\u2019s previous decisions would be cast into doubt and insurers would no longer be required to cover the affected preventive services.",
      "The panel is composed of outside experts and was set up as an independent body appointed by the federal official who heads the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. It currently has 16 members.",
      "The dispute is the latest in a long line of cases concerning the 2010 health care law \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement \u2014 which Republicans have relentlessly attacked in court as they have repeatedly tried and failed to repeal it. The Supreme Court narrowly upheld the bulk of the law in a major 2012 ruling.",
      "Ironically, on this occasion, the Trump administration is defending the provision after taking over the case from the Biden administration.",
      "The government argued that the task force members are lawfully appointed because they are ultimately under the supervision of the health and human services secretary, a position currently held by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which addresses any concerns that it is not accountable to the executive branch.",
      "As such, they do not exercise the kind of power that \u201cprincipal officers\u201d do and therefore do not need to be Senate-confirmed, government lawyers say.",
      "Even if the court were to find that the panel is unconstitutionally appointed, it could resolve the issue by finding that it is not independent and that its actions must be approved by the HHS secretary. The court took a similar approach in a 2021 case about in-house judges at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "If the Trump administration prevails on that point, then Kennedy and other officials would have greater control over the task force.",
      "The challengers argue there is no basis for the court to remedy the constitutional problem in the way the government suggests, with their lawyer describing the proposal as \u201cunlawful for many reasons,\u201d in part because it gives the HHS secretary powers that are not outlined in the statute.",
      "After the lawsuit was filed in 2020, a federal judge in Texas issued a ruling that said the structure of the task force was unconstitutional and all of its decisions should be considered invalid nationwide.",
      "The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed that ruling somewhat. The Biden administration then took the case to the Supreme Court."

      "From working as a bouncer at a Buenos Aires nightclub to presiding over the Vatican, the path Pope Francis forged as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was as unlikely as it was unprecedented.",
      "Francis, who died Monday at age 88, was keen to flex his muscles as supreme pontiff. He angered some Catholic Church traditionalists by reaching out to gay and marginalized people, demanding justice for the poor and the dispossessed and railing against unbridled capitalism and climate change.",
      "As the first pope from the Americas, Francis was in many ways the ultimate Vatican outsider who charted a new and more liberal course as the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "\u201cHe embarked on a real reorganization of the church, and a real reorientation of the church, after four decades of conservative theologians leading the way,\u201d said David Gibson, director of the Fordham Center on Religion and Culture.",
      "Case in point: Francis announced a radical change in Vatican policy in December 2023 by formally allowing priests to bless same-sex couples. Still, he continued to oppose gay marriage, to the dismay of more liberal Catholics.",
      "Francis also ratcheted up action against the sexual abuse of children by Catholic Church clergy by issuing the most extensive revision to its law in four decades, calling it \u201cour shame.\u201d",
      "And Francis steadfastly championed the plight of migrants at a time when many countries across the globe, including the United States, were closing their borders and right-wing politicians were demonizing them.",
      "\u201cWe cannot remain indifferent in the face of such human dramas,\u201d the pope said in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in May 2024. \u201cThe globalization of indifference is a very ugly disease. Very ugly.\u201d",
      "Francis pointedly criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt, during his first term in office, to prevent migrants fleeing violence in Central America from getting into the U.S. by building a wall on the  border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cI realize that with this problem, a government has a hot potato in its hands, but it must be resolved differently, humanely, not with razor wire,\u201d Francis insisted.",
      "But in doing so, Francis alienated many Catholics and Republicans in the United States who supported Trump and his border wall.",
      "To be sure, Francis was also criticized by the church's progressive wing. He refused to consider ordaining women. Victims of sexual abuse said his changes weren't strong enough. And he was accused last year of using a highly offensive term to describe gay men in a closed-door meeting, two weeks after the Vatican apologized for his use of the same slur.",
      "Francis faced the stiffest resistance from archconservative American clerics during the pandemic when he urged people to get vaccinated against Covid. He also found himself being accused of heresy for, among other things, softening the ban on giving Communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.",
      "Still, in many ways, Francis was cut from the same conservative clerical cloth as his predecessors Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict. He was against abortion, in favor of clerical celibacy and opposed to ordaining women, although he was open to giving them a greater role in running the church.",
      "It was Francis, after all, who gave final approval to make John Paul II, a religiously conservative Pole and another pontiff from \u201ca faraway land,\u201d a saint.",
      "Despite Francis\u2019 attempts to weed out sex abusers from the clerical ranks, many victims did not believe he went far enough to address the problem and punish offenders."

      "Americans do not think the president should have the ability to act unconstrained by the courts and Congress,\u00a0according to new research on U.S. attitudes on checks and balances. But\u00a0views on that question are divided by party amid President Donald Trump\u2019s running battle with judges over his administration\u2019s policies.",
      "A growing\u00a0list of policy changes\u00a0ordered by Trump since he was sworn in\u00a0have been\u00a0at least\u00a0temporarily blocked by federal judges\u00a0after being challenged in court,\u00a0including his moves\u00a0to end birthright citizenship, give Department of Government Efficiency employees access to the Treasury Department\u2019s payment systems, reduce the indirect cost recovery rate for all grants issued by the National Institutes of Health, eliminate the U.S. Agency for International Development, and\u00a0more.",
      "According to a\u00a0study\u00a0by the\u00a0nonpartisan\u00a0Congressional Research Service, at least 17 policies\u00a0were\u00a0blocked this way in the first two months of the second administration,\u00a0compared to\u00a019 such blockages during the entire Obama administration and 24 during the Biden administration.",
      "The figures\u00a0underscore how much of what the Trump administration has done has been contested in court \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0Trump and his allies have pushed\u00a0back against the judiciary as judges have blocked their policies. Trump called for a\u00a0judge\u00a0who ruled against him to be impeached,\u00a0prompting a\u00a0rare rebuke\u00a0from Chief Justice\u00a0John\u00a0Roberts.\u00a0Vice President JD Vance\u00a0argued\u00a0on X, \u201cJudges aren\u2019t allowed to control the executive\u2019s legitimate power,\u201d\u00a0while\u00a0border czar\u00a0Tom Holman said \u201cI don\u2019t care what judges think\u201d when asked about judicial efforts to block deportations.",
      "But does the public feel the same way \u2014\u00a0that a\u00a0president should have the right to ignore the wishes of the courts and Congress?",
      "To answer this question,\u00a0researchers\u00a0at the\u00a0Annenberg Public Policy Center\u00a0conducted a study last month as part of\u00a0the center\u2019s\u00a0Institutions of Democracy panel survey, interviewing\u00a0a nationally representative sample of 1,363 Americans from March 6-16\u00a0on\u00a0six questions designed to measure their support for the system of checks and balances.",
      "The data was remarkably clear: Americans do not think the president should have the ability to act unconstrained by the courts and Congress. With one small exception, a majority of the public rejects the claim that presidents should have expansive powers. While Republicans are the most supportive of greater executive power as\u00a0Trump currently\u00a0sits in\u00a0the Oval Office, most of them\u00a0still\u00a0reject claims of unilateral authority.",
      "Instead, Democrats, Republicans and independents alike believe that the courts and Congress should be able to check the president\u2019s actions. The one partial exception is that a majority of Republicans think that the president should have the authority to decide how executive agencies should implement the law. But even here, it is just a slight majority, and it is arguably a more subtle item than\u00a0the\u00a0other questions.",
      "Only 16% of respondents, for example, said a president should be able to ignore court decisions he believes intrude on his constitutional authority, including 27% of Republicans. On the question of whether a president should have the right to enact policies without Congress voting on them, 20% of respondents agreed, including a third of Republicans.",
      "More broadly, 58% overall agreed with the statement that courts prevent elected officials from abusing their power, including 51% of Republicans. And 84% overall agreed that courts play a vital role in our system of government, with little variation across partisan lines.",
      "The fact that the public \u2014\u00a0including\u00a0Republicans,\u00a0despite Trump\u2019s high levels of support from within his party\u00a0\u2014\u00a0doesn\u2019t support\u00a0efforts to ignore and cow the other branches is important, especially at a moment when so many important challenges to executive action are working their way through the courts.",
      "The fact that judges can block these sorts of policies is an example of America\u2019s system of checks and balances in action:\u00a0Individuals can sue and ask a court to review actions by the administration, and if the court rules that the action violates the law or the U.S. Constitution, they can block those policies from being enacted.",
      "The limitation for the courts is that they cannot independently enforce their rulings, but instead depend on the president, Congress and the public believing in our constitutional system enough to obey them.\u00a0But as Thomas Paine wrote in\u00a0\u201cCommon Sense\u201d\u00a0amid the birth of the United States, \u201cin America the law is king. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no other.\u201d"

      "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the Gulf Coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nation\u2019s worst offshore oil spill are still being felt.",
      "Oil company BP paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significant compensation.",
      "Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in Louisiana. As the Trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the Gulf Coast are slipping away.",
      "Tying health problems to the spill remains hard to prove in court",
      "In the coastal community of Lafitte in southeast Louisiana, Tammy Gremillion is celebrating Easter Sunday, the anniversary of the April 20 spill, without her daughter. She remembers warning Jennifer against joining a cleanup crew tasked with containing the spill for BP.",
      "\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t stop her \u2014 they were offering these kids lots of money,\u201d Gremillion said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the dangers. They didn\u2019t do what they should have to protect these young people.\u201d",
      "Jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. She also was exposed to Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has been linked to health problems.",
      "In 2020, Jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can be caused by exposure to oil.",
      "Gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughter\u2019s death, is \u201c1,000% confident\u201d that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against BP in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. Gremillion\u2019s suit is one of a small number of cases still pending.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed and only one has been settled.",

      "Oyster beds suffocated, reefs were blanketed in chemicals and the fishing industry tanked. Pelicans diving for dead fish emerged from the contaminated waters smeared in a black sheen. Tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Since then, \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made restoring Gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to The Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against BP.",
      "The council says more than 300 restoration projects worth $5.38 billion have been approved in the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America. The projects include acquiring wetlands in Mississippi to protect nesting areas for birds, rebuilding reefs along Pensacola Bay in Florida and restoring around 4 square miles (11 square kilometers) of marsh in Lake Borgne near New Orleans.",
      "While a tragedy, the spill \u201cgalvanized a movement \u2014 one that continues to push for a healthier, more resilient coast,\u201d said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a conservation coalition.",
      "The influx of billions of dollars in penalties paid by BP \u201callowed us to think bigger, act faster and rely on science to guide large-scale solutions,\u201d she added.",

      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has said the project would \u201cbreak our culture\u201d by harming local oyster and shrimp fisheries due to the influx of freshwater. Earlier this month, his administration paused the project for 90 days, citing its high costs, and its future remains uncertain.",

      "When notices arrived in March 2021 seeking about $12,000 in back rent, it was a shock. Espinal had quit her job at her husband\u2019s urging and he had promised to cover family expenses.",
      "Police reports documenting her husband\u2019s bursts of anger were enough for a judge to give her custody of their daughter in 2022, Espinal said.",

      "He shared that both his character and his older son, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) were alumni of Duke, while his wife, Victoria (Parker Posey) and daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) were alums of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This led to their younger son Lochlan (Sam Nivola) to struggle with his decision on which college to attend.",

      "\u201cWell, someone at Duke decided that was really untoward and was not happy with the association,\u201d Isaacs continued. \u201cOther people online were pointing out that there are real life alumni of Duke\u2019s to be far more worried about than a fictional alumni.\u201d",

The powerful brothers have a reputation that precedes them, invoking feelings of fear, admiration and love in each character they encounter.",

Jordan tells TODAY.com what he did to prepare for the double role and how he was able to develop each character, which had subtle but impactful differences.",

      "Blue Origin's all-female crew successfully made it to space, but when it comes to whether they are considered astronauts, former federal guidelines are bringing them back down to Earth.",
      "Earlier this week, Blue Origin's star-studded female flight crew, which included singer Katy Perry and journalist Gayle King, reached the edge of space and entered orbit. Their automated flight marked a milestone for commercial space travel but also sparked controversy and discussion along the way, especially over what it truly takes to earn the title of \"astronaut.\"",
      "In an April 17 post on X, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy described the team as \"brave and glam\" but underscored why the team lacks the achievements and criteria it takes to be recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as astronauts, a designation that has a high bar.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. commercial space industry is an inspiring project which showcases American ingenuity and exceptionalism,\u201d Duffy wrote in his post. \u201cBut the last FAA guidelines under the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program were clear: Crewmembers who travel into space must have \u2018demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety.\u2019\u201d",
      "The flight's six women \u2014 which, in addition to Perry and King, included aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen,\u00a0film producer Kerianne Flynn, and journalist Lauren S\u00e1nchez,\u00a0who is notably engaged to Blue Origin founder\u00a0Jeff Bezos \u2014 are highly accomplished in their respective fields.",
      "But when it comes to their space journey, Duffy says they do not meet the FAA\u2019s criteria.",
      "\u201cThe crew who flew to space this week on an automated flight by Blue Origin were brave and glam, but you cannot identify as an astronaut,\u201d continued Duffy\u2019s post about the proper terminology regarding what they achieved. \u201cThey do not meet the FAA astronaut criteria.\u201d",
      "Who is considered an astronaut?",
      "The answer to this varies depending on who you ask.",
      "The FAA's now-retired Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program required travelers to meet two standards: flown at least 50 miles  above Earth and performed duties essential to public or human spaceflight safety.",
      "The FAA\u2019s Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program was established in 2004 and\u00a0officially ended in 2021 in anticipation of the commercial space tourism era. Still, the Wings Program continues to maintain a complete list of FAA Commercial Space Astronaut Wings recipients. Bowe, Nguyen, Flynn, King, Perry, and S\u00e1nchez are all recognized on the website\u00a0but are not listed as recipients of the FAA's Commercial Space Astronaut Wings, as none of them held operational roles while on board.",
      "Outside FAA standards, NASA defines an astronaut as someone selected to join its astronaut corps and who has made \"star sailing\" their profession.",
      "Meanwhile, Merriam-Webster also uses profession as a defining factor, noting the term refers to \"a person whose profession is to travel beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\" In its broader definition, the dictionary defines an astronaut as \"any person who travels beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\""

      "HBO describes the show as \u201ca realistic examination of the challenges facing health care workers in today\u2019s America as seen through the lens of the frontline heroes working in a modern-day hospital in Pittsburgh.\u201d",
      "Noah Wyle, the show's lead, who previously starred on \"ER,\" told Variety in January that Dr. Joe Sachs, who was a technical advisor on \"ER,\" helped with \"The Pitt\" to ensure the writing was accurate.",
      "\"He puts everything into making sure that the realism is on the page, on the stage, and making sure that the community that he comes from is being honored and the stories that they want told are being depicted,\" Wyle said.",
      "And viewers are loving it. Doctors even told The New York Times that they feel \u201cseen\u201d by the series.",
      "But one plot line in particular has prompted feedback from a particular group of health professionals: social workers.",
      "Episode 7 addresses what's known as the mandatory reporting process, after the wife of a patient shares with a doctor that she suspects her husband is abusing their daughter.",
      "In most states, including Pennsylvania, people in certain professions \u2014 such as health care workers \u2014 are required by law to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect, according the National Association of Mandated Reporters. How to report the suspected abuse depends on the state, but it's often by phone or online.",
      "In the episode, Susan Dunn (Jessica Morris) arrives to the hospital with her adolescent daughter, Alana (Ivy George), as her husband, Silas (Tyler Poelle), is taken into surgery. After medical tests reveal he has high levels of the hormone progesterone, Susan admits to giving it to him.",
      "\u201cI put it in his coffee every morning. I thought if I could kill his libido, he\u2019d stop. ... I think he\u2019s molesting our daughter,\" Susan tells Dr. Trinity Santos, played by Isa Briones.",
      "Santos reports this claim to Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, played by Wyle, including some additional details from Susan about what exactly she believes Silas is doing to their daughter. Susan also says Alana's behavior has changed and she's struggling in school.",
      "\"It's grooming, and we are mandated reporters of child abuse in Pennsylvania,\" Santos says.",
      "The hospital's social worker, Kiara, played by Krystel McNeil, disagrees, though. \"There's nothing to report unless we have proof,\" Kiara says. \"Right now, it's all speculative.\"",
      "\"We can't do anything unless the daughter comes forward,\" Kiara adds. \"We can try to talk to her.\"",
      "But this is a less-than-accurate portrayal of how the mandatory reporting process usually works.",
      "A TikTok by social worker Rachel LaPointe explains what would have happened in real life.",
      "\u201cIn the vast majority of states, it's only the suspicion of child abuse that kickstarts your mandate to report,\" LaPointe explains. \"A parent saying they believe this is going on inside of their home is absolutely enough suspicion to qualify.\"",
      "Bambi Fisher, director of Women and Children\u2019s Health in the Department of Social Work Services at Mount Sinai Kravis Children\u2019s Hospital, agrees. She tells TODAY.com that this portrayal is \"absolutely incorrect\" if the daughter is a minor. (The show doesn't state how old she is, but the actor who plays her is currently 17.)",
      "\"I think any social worker who's been trained by child protection protocols would disagree\" with \"The Pitt's\" portrayal, Fisher says. \"The mandate is suspicion of abuse and neglect, and we 100% are not investigators.\"",
      "Instead, Fisher says that a hospital social worker's responsibility is to file a report to Child Protection Services if there is any abuse suspicion. CPS then has the option of \"accepting or not accepting a report.\" If accepted \u2014\u00a0which Fisher believes this case would be \u2014 it would then be investigated by CPS, not the mandatory reporter.",
      "\"If a parent came to us and said exactly what (the mom) said ... those are all big red flags,\" Fisher adds.",
      "The mandated reporting process depends on the state but usually involves calling the mandated reporter number, explaining the circumstances and then sharing where the child lives, their age and if there are any other siblings in the home.",
      "\"It's a very scripted form,\" Fisher explains.",
      "In the episode, instead of reporting the abuse suspicions, Robinavitch and Kiara recommend Susan speak with someone about her feelings and talk to Alana, and they offer to connect her with law enforcement.",
      "\"Hopefully now that it's out in the open, she'll take the necessary steps to handle this the right way,\" Robinavitch tells Santos.",
      "While Fisher says the recommendation to have the mom speak to someone is \"very helpful,\" she reiterates that with kids under 18, the protocol isn't allowing the family to decide whether to contact law enforcement. It's reporting the suspected abuse to CPS.",
      "\"The Pitt\" wraps up this arc with Santos confronting Silas while he's still in his hospital bed. She delivers a monologue where she calls him \"child molester\" and threatens to involve the police and kill him if he doesn't stop touching his daughter.",
      "It's a powerful scene, but this moment in particular concerned LaPointe.",
      "\"If you are ever in a comparable situation, do not do that,\" she says in the TikTok. \"That is actually an incredibly dangerous thing to do, as that man was about to go home with his wife and daughter without any real discussion of safety plans or what happens next. 'The Pitt' created a scenario where this daughter is actually in far more danger when she goes home because of the actions of the doctors.\"",
      "\"Maybe that's the point, but they never acknowledged it as wrong, and they never brought it back up again,\" LaPoint continues. \"At the end of the day, that's never how people who are trained in trauma-informed care would've handled that.\"",
      "Fisher adds that if the mandated reporting had been done correctly, Alana \"wouldn\u2019t necessarily be allowed to go home without Child Protection saying the child\u2019s safe to go home.\u201d",
      "Despite its mischaracterization of mandatory reporting in Episode 7, both Fisher and LaPointe are still big fans of \"The Pitt.\"",
      "LaPointe even starts her TikTok saying how she's \"obsessed\" with the show and that the only reason she's posting the feedback is that Wyle has said he wants the show to be as accurate as possible.",
      "Fisher agrees. \"Even if there were issues with Episode 7 ... the portrayal of the social worker as critical to the whole team was very positive,\" she says."

      "The characters spend the early hours of the evening in pure revelry, dancing and singing along to Sammie\u2019s music before an uninvited guest named Remmick (O\u2019Connell) asks to be invited in. He is denied, but ominously waits outside.",
      "Each time a character leaves the juke joint, they return changed and suddenly need approval to re-enter. Sensing an otherworldly presence, Annie quickly realizes that Remmick is a vampire who bites and creates more blood-thirsty creatures whenever a guest leaves the safety of the jukebar.",
      "Remmick later turns Mary into a vampire, who in turn does the same to her former lover Stack. Soon, more guests are turned into the undead and only a handful of humans remain.",
      "Who dies in 'Sinners'?",
      "Ultimately, everyone who is bitten and turned into a vampire dies, but some of those vampires do live on, which viewers learn in a post-credits scene.",
      "Leading up to the climatic battle, Smoke, Annie, Delta Slim, Pearline, Grace and Sammie decide to think of a plan while Remmick and the other vampires await their demise. After a desperate Grace welcomes the vampires in, the others, armed with stakes and holy water, fight for their lives.",
      "Annie is bitten and Smoke stabs her in the heart, at her request, before she becomes a vampire. Pearline is also killed and Grace is burned alive trying to defend herself against a vampire who has taken over her husband\u2019s body. Delta Slim chooses to sacrifice himself to give Smoke and Sammie time to escape.",
      "Before the credits officially roll, viewers learn that Smoke and Sammie are the only humans left standing.",
      "Lindo spoke to TODAY.com about his character\u2019s fate and why it was honorable given Delta Slim\u2019s backstory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very heroic thing to do, but it\u2019s also a sacrifice that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to, as I see it (and) as Delta Slim sees it, preserve the future of the music and the future of the culture, it has to be done.\u201d",
      "Miller, who was also interviewed by TODAY.com, chimed in and added that Delta Slim\u2019s death represents \u201cthe redemption of whatever ills that he may have, that he may be carrying.\u201d",
      "Lindo agreed, saying his character felt compelled to save Sammie.",
      "\u201cThe fact is part of my (character\u2019s) alcoholism comes out of the guilt that I feel at not being able to have saved my friend who I talked about in the car,\" he explained. \"So it is redemptive. I couldn\u2019t save him, but I will save the young preacher boy, the young one, the young pup who\u2019s carrying the tradition forward.\u201d",
      "Who survives in 'Sinners'?",
      "As the last humans standing, Smoke and Sammie attempt to flee but vampire Stack catches them. Smoke and Stack fight and Smoke appears to get the upper hand before the scene cuts to show Sammie, who jumped out a window and injured his leg, being surrounded by Remmick and all the vampires.",
      "While Remmick tries to drown and kill Sammie, the young musician reaches for his guitar \u2014 which the twins gave to him \u2014 and smashes it into Remmick\u2019s head. The metal plate on the guitar lodges in Remmick\u2019s head and kills him as the sun rises and turns all the other vampires into ashes.",
      "Sammie returns home and the scene of him walking into the church service replays. Meanwhile, Smoke, who also survived, stays at the juke joint and waits for the man who sold him the old mill to arrive. He shoots the landowner and all the Ku Klux Klan members after previously learning from Remmick that they had planned to ambush Smoke, Stack and their friends the next morning.",
      "During the shootout, one bullet hits Smoke and he slowly dies before being greeted by an apparition of Annie and their child, who died years ago.",
      "Sammie now becomes the only human survivor. However, once the post-credits roll, viewers learn that Stack and Mary, who are both vampires, have survived as well.",
      "What do the two post-credits scenes mean?",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d waits until a post-credits scene to reveal if Sammie chose to rebuke music like his father asked.",
      "As the credits roll, viewers see an older Sammie playing music at a dive bar with his band in the \u201890s. The musician chose to continue to pursue his love of music despite that traumatic night.",
      "In a second post-credits scene, the older version of Sammie sits at a bar before two familiar faces join him: Stack and Mary. It is revealed that Mary ran off and evaded the sunlight before Remmick and the others were burned years ago.",
      "Stack sits by Sammie\u2019s side and shares that he made a deal with Smoke during their fight to leave Sammie alone. Sammie tells them that he was having the best day of his life before the bloodbath. Stack agrees, pointing out that it was the last moment he felt sunshine and saw his brother.",
      "Stack and Mary then leave, leaving the door open for a potential sequel."

      "After three seasons of \u201cBosch: Legacy\u201d on Prime Video \u2014 the popular show with a strong fan base has finally come to an end.",
      "As a spinoff of \u201cBosch,\u201d which ran for seven seasons on Prime Video, \u201cBosch: Legacy\u201d was launched in 2022 and became a fan favorite in its own right. The franchise is based on author Michael Connelly\u2019s Harry Bosch novels, which follows gritty Los Angeles Police detective Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), who solves crimes while also dealing with his unresolved past.",
      "In \u201cBosch: Legacy,\u201d we see Bosch retired from the force, and now working as a private investigator. His daughter Maddie (Madison Lintz) is a LAPD patrol officer, and Season One ends with her dramatic kidnapping. In Season 2, fans see Bosch race against time to save his daughter, eventually rescuing her in the Mojave Desert. Season 2 ends with Maddie receiving a phone call from an inmate who tells that her that her kidnapper has been killed in prison, at the request of her father.",

      "What happens in the final season of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "In the final season of \u201cBosch: Legacy,\u201d Harry is seen dealing with a multitude of issues, including the suspicion of murder after an inmate calls his daughter, Maddie, to tell her that he put a hit out on her kidnapper in prison.",
      "He's also confronted with his past decisions after a solider tells Maddie that her father tortured and killed an enemy bomber during his military service in Afghanistan. Welliver tells TODAY.com that after all these \"things come to light\" a \"strain is placed\" on his and Maddie's relationship.",
      "\u201cMaddie, knowing who her father is, is deeply confused. And so what happens is that there is an investigation that is opened up. Is there any fact?\u201d Welliver asks, rhetorically. \u201cSo, Maddie has to juggle who she knows her father to be.\u201d",
      "Amid the investigations looking into his past, Bosch is also working on investigations of his own: he's trying to figure out what happened to a family that disappeared.",
      "\u201cHarry also is hired by a woman from Ireland whose entire family has gone missing, which is her daughter, son in law, and her two grandchildren. They\u2019ve just vanished into thin air,\u201d Welliver explains. \u201cAnd as Bosch navigates every case, they all become personal, but this one involves children and a family, and I would say we see Harry brought to the absolute edge, looking into the abyss in this.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Honey Chandler (Mimi Rogers) is campaigning to become district attorney and must deal with rising threats to her hopes for office.",
      "Welliver says that this season finds Bosch at the crossroads of his sense of right and wrong.",
      "\u201cWhere we find him now in this final season, there\u2019s some questions that have arisen. Has he in fact, compromised his moral compass?\u201d",
      "What happens in the final episode of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "In the final episode of \"Bosch: Legacy,\" Bosch and Detective Renee Ballard (Maggie Q) are both working to catch the \"Flower Girls\" killer. \"I made a promise to these girls Mads, I'm going to see it through,\" he tells Maddie in the episode, when she reminds him he's retired.",
      "With Maddie's help, Bosch connects a local firehouse to the crimes, and a specific fireman named Jeremy McKee fits the bill. They get a DNA sample with the help of Maddie and her partner. At the same time, Bosch's associate Mo is breaking into the suspect's house for intel. Mo then finds the address of where the killer will strike next, and they apprehend McKee and save his would-be victim.",
      "In the final scene, Bosch and Ballard go for a walk, and have a moment where he praises her for her work. \"Maybe someday down the line we'll get to work together again,\" he says in the episode.",
      "Ballard then compliments Bosch's works, but adds says that some of the  \"darkness\" in their line of work has gotten into Harry. She tells him to \"be safe,\" and walks away.",
      "The scene ends with Harry walking off alone downtown as the camera captures the city in the background.",
      "Does Bosch die in \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "No, Harry Bosch does not die in the final episode. But Welliver says that the series ending doesn\u2019t provide much closure.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re left at the end of the season, in the final episode, there\u2019s always a kind of \u2014 there\u2019s always a lack of resolution to a certain degree that we leave emotionally Harry with. And I think in that regard, that remains consistent,\" Welliver says. \"But as far as there being ... any kind of genuine closure, or the audience going, 'Well, what\u2019s next?' We don\u2019t know. So with that being said, It\u2019s Hollywood \u2014 stranger things have happened.\"",
      "Will there be another season of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "While another season of \"Bosch: Legacy\" has not been confirmed, a spinoff of \"Bosch\" has been confirmed, which will follow Bosch\u2019s protege, Renee Ballard (Maggie Q). We get introduced to Ballard before the series wraps up, setting her up for her own show.",
      "\u201cBallard is also a character in Michael Connelly\u2019s books, and she and Harry cross paths, and then he becomes sort of a mentor,\u201d Welliver tells TODAY.com. \u201cHis relationship to her is almost sort of quasi-paternal. We don\u2019t get to go that deep into the relationship, but we do introduce them and connect them in a way that certainly springs off the character of Ballard, so we know who she is.\u201d",
      "As far as Welliver officially reprising his role for a new spinoff, the actor says never say never.",
      "When asked if he would go back to the role, Welliver offered a simple answer: \u201cIt\u2019s a very immediate, \u2018Yes,\u2019 he tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"Because I have such a strong connection and kinship to that, to that character. So we\u2019ll see, you never know,\u201d he adds.",
      "After the season finale, Welliver said in an interview with TV Insider, published April 17, that he would make an appearance on the Maggie Q's \"Bosch\" spinoff.",
      "\"I will just say there is some crossover, for lack of a better term,\" he said before teasing that the new series will involve Ballard being \"kicked to cold case which isn\u2019t like moving higher up on the ladder in RHD (Robbery-Homicide Division).\"",
      "Maggie Q noted that she and Bosch both \"hate injustice and there were some injustices that Ballard faced in RHD.\"",
      "\"She stood up for herself and there was consequences or that,\" she told the outlet. \"That\u2019s a very Bosch move in terms of what they will sacrifice for a greater good.\"",
      "Welliver concurred, adding that Ballard will now have to lean on people who are outside of her department for help.",
      "\"There\u2019s a lot of people in the system that she can\u2019t trust,\" he said. \"And funnily enough, the guy that she came into this not trusting is probably the most trusted person that she can rely on. And he\u2019s not even in the department.\""

I had to pitch this at the highest levels and just walk through the whole story and try to infect them \u2014 funny choice of words, given the storyline \u2014 because, as I pitched it, you could understand, as a writer, how suddenly the whole world felt more alive. It felt more real because this thing had happened.\u201d",
      "Minear also shared why it had to be Bobby who died in the dramatic episode.",
      "\"Well, I think it needed to be Bobby for a lot of reasons,\" he told Variety. \"The first reason is that it made sense. It didn\u2019t feel arbitrary, because if you track the tragic arc of his character, of where he started, and how he came to L.A. looking for atonement, it just makes a kind of tragic sense for his character in a way it wouldn\u2019t for another character.\"",
      "The showrunner also noted that the show had the intent to leave the season with a bang.",
      "\"I just didn\u2019t want to go small,\" he said. \"Not that any of the characters are small, but Bobby\u2019s death affects every single character\u2019s story in a way that really no other character death would.\"",
      "Will Peter Krause return to '9-1-1' ?",
      "Though the finality of Bobby's death appears to be certain, Minear tells Variety that Peter Krause is still likely to appear on a future episode.",
      "\"Well, I will say that Episode 15 is not Peter Krause\u2019s final appearance this season,\" he teased without sharing details.",
      "In a March interview with People, Angela Bassett, who plays Bobby's wife, Athena, talked about her relationship with Krause on the show.",
      "When asked if she could envision a world where their characters don't exist, she said, \"Absolutely not. It would be so different.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even know what the show would be like without them together. It\u2019s hard to imagine,\" she added."

      "Benson approaches the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and knocks on the window asking who the driver is and why he\u2019s talking to her son. The car pulls away before she can get any sort of answer.",

      "Enter her longtime partner, Stabler, who approaches the driver of the vehicle while he\u2019s using a urinal in the men\u2019s room. This isn\u2019t the first time Benson has called on Stabler to protect her son. In Season 24, she asked him to safely bring Noah home after a threat from a gang. Benson also said at the time there was no one she trusted more to keep her son safe than Stabler.",
      "Stabler takes the adjacent urinal and says, \u201cYou might not know me, but I know you \u2014 and not in a vague kind of way.\u201d",

      "From working as a bouncer at a Buenos Aires nightclub to presiding over the Vatican, the path Pope Francis forged as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was as unlikely as it was unprecedented.",
      "Francis, who died Monday at age 88, was keen to flex his muscles as supreme pontiff. He angered some Catholic Church traditionalists by reaching out to gay and marginalized people, demanding justice for the poor and the dispossessed and railing against unbridled capitalism and climate change.",
      "As the first pope from the Americas, Francis was in many ways the ultimate Vatican outsider who charted a new and more liberal course as the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "\u201cHe embarked on a real reorganization of the church, and a real reorientation of the church, after four decades of conservative theologians leading the way,\u201d said David Gibson, director of the Fordham Center on Religion and Culture.",
      "Case in point: Francis announced a radical change in Vatican policy in December 2023 by formally allowing priests to bless same-sex couples. Still, he continued to oppose gay marriage, to the dismay of more liberal Catholics.",
      "Francis also ratcheted up action against the sexual abuse of children by Catholic Church clergy by issuing the most extensive revision to its law in four decades, calling it \u201cour shame.\u201d",
      "And Francis steadfastly championed the plight of migrants at a time when many countries across the globe, including the United States, were closing their borders and right-wing politicians were demonizing them.",
      "\u201cWe cannot remain indifferent in the face of such human dramas,\u201d the pope said in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in May 2024. \u201cThe globalization of indifference is a very ugly disease. Very ugly.\u201d",
      "Francis pointedly criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt, during his first term in office, to prevent migrants fleeing violence in Central America from getting into the U.S. by building a wall on the  border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cI realize that with this problem, a government has a hot potato in its hands, but it must be resolved differently, humanely, not with razor wire,\u201d Francis insisted.",
      "But in doing so, Francis alienated many Catholics and Republicans in the United States who supported Trump and his border wall.",
      "To be sure, Francis was also criticized by the church's progressive wing. He refused to consider ordaining women. Victims of sexual abuse said his changes weren't strong enough. And he was accused last year of using a highly offensive term to describe gay men in a closed-door meeting, two weeks after the Vatican apologized for his use of the same slur.",
      "Francis faced the stiffest resistance from archconservative American clerics during the pandemic when he urged people to get vaccinated against Covid. He also found himself being accused of heresy for, among other things, softening the ban on giving Communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.",
      "Still, in many ways, Francis was cut from the same conservative clerical cloth as his predecessors Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict. He was against abortion, in favor of clerical celibacy and opposed to ordaining women, although he was open to giving them a greater role in running the church.",
      "It was Francis, after all, who gave final approval to make John Paul II, a religiously conservative Pole and another pontiff from \u201ca faraway land,\u201d a saint.",
      "Despite Francis\u2019 attempts to weed out sex abusers from the clerical ranks, many victims did not believe he went far enough to address the problem and punish offenders."

    "summary": "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and \u201cbreaches of order\u201d in an incident last month when Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian emergency workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and \u201cbreaches of order\u201d in\u00a0an\u00a0incident last month\u00a0when Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian\u00a0emergency\u00a0workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
      "In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media Sunday, the IDF said it \u201cregrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\u201d and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer.",
      "The report and the IDF\u2019s rare acceptance of blame were the culmination of a weekslong scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel\u2019s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident on March 23, and cellphone video found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d Brig. Gen.\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, said the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim the IDF also denied.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement after the bodies were found that the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff members and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed people they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video from the Palestine Red Crescent challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed video from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and the presentation, which retired Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who led the presentation, said were conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics whom the IDF considered terrorists had changed.",
      "The report and the presentation also left it unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in its custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance video.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and that they misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, whom the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary said, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In a video, Mahmoud Ajjour is beaming as he skips into the breeze. He breaks into laughter as he watches his kite flutter in the sky, pulling it along with a string tied around his waist, in a moment that captured the irrepressible joy of childhood.",
      "At 9 years old, Mahmoud has known more trauma than most will see in a lifetime. On Dec. 6, 2023, the fourth grader was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, a blast that severed one of his arms and left the other so badly damaged it had to be amputated. On Thursday, an image of Mahmoud, taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times, was named World Press Photo of the Year, a haunting portrait of the impact of the war on children.",
      "Mahmoud now lives in Doha, Qatar, with his family, after becoming one of a very small number of Palestinians to be evacuated from Gaza for urgent medical treatment.",
      "When Mahmoud smiles, his happiness seems infectious, but some days are harder than others. \u201cThere are bad moments for him,\u201d his mother, Nour Ajjour, 36, told NBC News by phone from Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play or go outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe keep him busy and have fun with him,\u201d Ajjour said. She sent videos of him gleefully speeding down a hallway on an electric bike, steering with his feet on the handlebars, and using his feet to play with a lump of bright-green clay.",
      "For now, Ajjour said, there\u2019s not much Mahmoud can do on his own, and he\u2019s impatient for prostheses, asking when he can have them so he can drink water on his own or help his family.",
      "\u201cHe likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,\u201d Ajjour said.",
      "Doctors at Doha\u2019s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms.",
      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

      "Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 90 people in 48 hours, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said Saturday, as Israeli troops ramp up attacks to pressure Hamas to release its hostages and disarm.",
      "The dead include 15 people who were killed overnight, among them women and children, some of whom were sheltering in a designated humanitarian zone, according to hospital staff.",
      "At least 11 people were killed in the southern city of Khan Younis, several of them in a tent in the Mwasi area where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are living, hospital workers said. Israel has designated it as a humanitarian zone.",
      "Four other people were killed in separate strikes in Rafah city, including a mother and her daughter, according to the European Hospital, where the bodies were brought.",
      "At the funeral in Khan Younis Saturday afternoon, families wept over the bodies of their relatives and cried out in pain. \u201cOmar is gone ... I wish it was me,\u00a8 screamed the brother of one of the victims.",
      "Israel has vowed to intensify attacks across Gaza and occupy large \u201csecurity zones\u201d inside the strip. For six weeks Israel also has blockaded Gaza, barring the entry of food and other goods.",
      "This week, aid groups\u00a0raised the alarm, saying that thousands of children have become malnourished and most people are barely eating one meal a day as stocks dwindle, according to the United Nations.",
      "On Friday, Dr. Hanan Balkhy, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s eastern Mediterranean office, urged the new U.S. ambassador in Israel,\u00a0Mike Huckabee,\u00a0to push the country to lift Gaza\u2019s blockade so medicines and other aid can enter the strip.",
      "\u201cI would wish for him to go in and see the situation firsthand,\u201d she said.",
      "In his first appearance as ambassador on Friday, Huckabee visited the Western Wall, the holiest Jewish prayer site in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. He inserted a prayer into the wall, which he said was handwritten by U.S. President Donald Trump. Huckabee said every effort was being made to bring home the remaining hostages held by Hamas.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Most of the hostages have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has since killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to\u00a0Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The war has destroyed vast parts of Gaza and most of its food production capabilities. Around 90% of the population is displaced, with hundreds of thousands of people living in tent camps and bombed-out buildings."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Marcus Wu\u2019s home racing simulator setup needs one more thing: a manual gearshift. A decade ago, one from a Western brand would have been a no-brainer for gamers like the 12-year-old Hongkonger.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing escalates, the fact that Wu opted for a gearshift from Chinese manufacturer Moza illustrates how far Chinese manufacturers have come in competing with their Western counterparts on affordability and quality.",
      "The deepening economic conflict between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has the potential to wreak havoc on a complex web of globalized commerce. And Trump\u2019s attempts to claw back manufacturing to American shores could have unintended consequences, including giving Chinese technology manufacturers an edge at a time when American products are already becoming expensive.",
      "Wu and his father-cum-financier, Mingfai, have already made their choice, opting for a Chinese alternative over American brands such as the Oregon-based Thrustmaster. \u201cIf only the price was good but the quality wasn\u2019t, then I wouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cBut this is cheaper and works great.\u201d",
      "The duo were browsing Hong Kong\u2019s Sham Shui Po computer market \u2014 a sprawling hub of small tech stores selling everything from computer parts to gaming equipment for casual gamers and enthusiasts alike.",
      "To residents and tourists from mainland China \u2014 a country with a gaming market of half a billion users \u2014 the market is a one-stop shop, featuring top American brands including Dell, Corsair and the Nasdaq-listed Swiss manufacturer Logitech.",
      "Those are just some of the companies competing for market share in a gaming industry that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates will be worth $300 billion by 2027. According to China\u2019s Game Industry Report, China\u2019s gamers contributed $44 billion in sales revenues to the industry last year.",
      "To be sure, Western brands are still popular when it comes to big-ticket items like monitors, processors and storage devices, but sellers at the market told NBC News that Chinese brands have been knocking it out of the park when it comes to accessories, like mice, keyboards and simulator setups.",
      "\u201cSo many Chinese manufacturers popped up after the pandemic,\u201d said Dennis Leung, a sales assistant at a store that specializes in gaming peripherals. \u201cThey often provide an extremely cheap and bargain price compared to the whole market,\u201d he said.",
      "Standing in front of a table of 30 mice, Leung held up two with identical feel and weight. The Chinese option, which was cheaper and more powerful, had been outselling its Western counterpart, he said.",
      "The Trump administration last week issued a memorandum saying that electronics including computers, smartphones and some components will be temporarily exempt from levies imposed on Chinese imports.",
      "But Trump\u2019s indication that duties on semiconductors and other technology could be on their way means it\u2019s still unclear whether electronics could get more expensive in the U.S. and whether prices of American-made products could go up for the rest of the world, too.",
      "That uncertainty may already be causing nervousness at companies such as Dell \u2014 the $56 billion tech giant has a 20% share of the global gaming market \u2014 as well as the $12 billion market cap for Logitech and specialists such as Corsair, which is worth $630 million.",
      "The administration\u2019s market-roiling tariffs come at a time when the quality of Chinese products has already vastly improved. That\u2019s giving Hong Kong\u2019s vendors a chance to capitalize.",
      "When it comes to buying gaming accessories, shoppers don\u2019t really care where the end product is coming from, Kira Fong, manager of another store in the market, told NBC News. \u201cMost people just look for quality. They still want the best equipment,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysts expect Chinese-made tech products only to get better.",
      "\u201cPeople are choosing more Chinese-made products in each industry, not just personal computers, gaming, smartphones or electric vehicles,\u201d said Xiao Feng Zeng, who analyzes China\u2019s gaming and esports industry at Niko Partners, an Asian and European gaming intelligence firm.",
      "\u201cTheir quality is better and the price is cheaper,\u201d the Shanghai-based vice president said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt America\u2019s ability to compete for young gamers.",
      "The policies of the president, who refers to himself as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d are already feeding through into higher prices.",
      "Hyte, a gaming PC sister brand of the California-based iBuyPower, said this month on X that while it was standing by increased prices, those prices will not be sustainable long term.",
      "That was not a problem for Marcus Wu, and more importantly his dad, at checkout at the Sham Shui Po market.",
      "With his son excited to go home and play with his new gearshift, Mingfai Wu breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Chinese,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s cheap and good!\u201d"

      "A haunting portrait of a young Palestinian boy from the Gaza Strip who lost both of his arms in an Israeli strike has been named World Press Photo of the Year for 2025.",
      "Mahmoud Ajjour, 9, was fleeing an Israeli attack in Gaza with his family when he turned back to urge his loved ones to move forward, the World Press Photo organization said in a statement accompanying the picture taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf.",
      "Then he was hit in an explosion, the Netherlands-based nonprofit added.",
      "One of Ajjour's arms was completely severed, while the other was left severely injured and ultimately had to be amputated.",
      "\u201cOne of the most difficult things Mahmoud\u2019s mother explained to me was how when Mahmoud first came to the realization that his arms were amputated,\u201d Abu Elouf said in the statement from World Press Photo. \u201cThe first sentence he said to her was, \u2018How will I be able to hug you?\u2019\u201d",
      "Ajjour's mother, Nour Ajjour recalled that painful moment in a phone interview with NBC News on Friday.",
      "\"The first few days were very difficult. He was in a lot of pain as there was no anaesthetic,\" she said. \"He would look at his hands and not see them. He would scream and say, 'where are my hands?' And the first thing he said was, 'how will I hug you?' and 'how will I pray?'\"",
      "Ajjour was evacuated out of Gaza for treatment in Qatar's capital, Doha, where Abu Elouf took his portrait for The New York Times. The photographer also fled to the city.",
      "Ajjour is one of hundreds of children in Gaza to have lost at least one limb during the war, which has seen more than 51,000 people killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "UNICEF warned in December 2023 that around 1,000 children in Gaza had seen one or both legs amputated alone since Oct. 7, 2023, when Israel began its military campaign in the enclave following the Hamas-led terror attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "\u201cThese are unbelievable numbers,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Al-Fara,\u00a0head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview earlier this month, noting that thousands of children have also been killed and more still have been left without one or both parents.",
      "Al-Fara said he could not understand \u201cthe silence of the world\u201d in the midst of the widespread devastation in Gaza, where much of the enclave has been destroyed.",
      "Many of the operations children in Gaza have had to undergo have been done without anesthetic, according to UNICEF, with the enclave's health care system also hit hard by Israel's offensive, which it restarted last month after a pause in the fighting.",
      "Talks for a permanent end to the fighting were supposed to begin after the first phase of the ceasefire deal \u2014 in which Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 ended March 1.",
      "But Israeli forces\u00a0shattered the fragile truce and have since launched airstrikes on the enclave while also resuming military ground operations.",
      "Israel has also barred the entry of medical supplies, along with food, water and other vital aid, during a more than monthlong blockade of the enclave.",
      "Efforts to secure a more permanent ceasefire and secure the release of hostages held in Gaza have so far failed to yield results.",
      "In the meantime, Ajjour is learning how to live without his arms.",
      "\"We all help Mahmoud in everything, in food, drink, clothing and the smallest things.\" But she said her son is also learning to use his feet to do things like writing and playing games on his mobile phone.",

      "Little-known artists have long bragged that they\u2019re \u201cbig in Japan,\u201d but a Spanish-language musical juggernaut is sweeping a much bigger market across the East China Sea.",
      "With its Latin beats and pulsating rhythms, reggaeton music has conquered dance floors across the world, but it\u2019s being put to a different use in China: college students are using the strains of J Balvin and Bad Bunny to help them learn Spanish.",
      "According to a study from Barcelona\u2019s Universitat Pompeu Fabra, the number of Chinese students taking its translation and language science classes has risen 37% from five years ago, but China\u2019s formal educational resources for learning Spanish are far less developed than they are for learning English.",
      "Instead, students are turning to social media sites and streaming services such as NetEase Cloud Music (NECM) to engage with digital language content, with translations of reggaeton songs garnering millions of views on the platform.",
      "The UPF study, which was published last month in the journal \u201cLanguage and Intercultural Communication,\u201d says that amateur translators often collaborate with Latin music lovers on the popular streaming site, using various \u201cintercultural mediation strategies\u201d to make it easier for the Chinese public to understand some of reggaeton\u2019s more niche or idiomatic Spanish cultural references without Chinese equivalents.",
      "The report says that around 2 in 3 translators get past the barriers of language and culture by swapping Spanish expressions with other Chinese imagery. The expression \u201cget stood up,\u201d for example, becomes \u201cfree[ing] a dove\u201d \u2014 a Chinese expression for breaking a promise.",
      "Even after they\u2019ve cleared cultural hurdles, users wanting to spread hits such as \u201cDespacito\u201d and \u201cGasolina\u201d to Guangzhou and Chengdu then need to satisfy China\u2019s censors.",
      "As with TikTok, certain words and phrases are redacted on Chinese social media, especially those containing sexual references, which regularly come up in reggaeton songs.",
      "While asterisks placed between Chinese characters by translators can help bypass this censorship, Mandarin phrases and characters are usually not separated by spaces as they are in English. That means starring out frowned-upon language can alter the meanings of lyrics and add an extra challenge to translators.",
      "Using cultural output such as French cinema or Italian cooking is a language learning method that has long been deployed by teachers the world over. Spreading reggaeton to China may be helping drive an interest in Spanish culture \u2014 at least at UPF anyway.",
      "The university's cohort of Chinese students has grown by almost a third to 275 in the past five years.",
      "One of them, whose name the report changes to \u201cBenito,\u201d has 1,300 followers on NECM and his translations have been viewed more than 2 million times."

      "Vance landed at New Delhi\u2019s Palam airport on Monday following a visit to Rome, where he held a\u00a0private meeting\u00a0with Pope Francis on Easter Sunday.",
      "Modi and\u00a0Vance\u00a0are expected to review progress made on the bilateral agenda\u00a0outlined in February\u00a0when the Indian leader met President Donald Trump in Washington. It includes \u201cfairness\u201d in their two-way trade and growing their defense partnership.",
      "The Indian prime minister was one of the first world leaders to meet Trump after he took office, and Reuters has reported that his government is\u00a0open to cutting tariffs\u00a0on more than half of its imports from the U.S., which were worth a total $41.8 billion in 2024, as part of a trade deal.",
      "However, the U.S. president has continued to call India a \u201ctariff abuser\u201d and \u201ctariff king.\u201d",

      "Discussions on such procurements would be taken forward during U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s expected visit to India in the next couple of months, people familiar with the matter said."

      "Economic ministers from Thailand and Indonesia are currently in the United States, with Malaysia set to join later this week, all seeking trade negotiations.",
      "Six countries in Southeast Asia were hit with tariffs ranging from 32% to 49%, threatening trade-reliant economies that have benefited from investment from levies imposed on Beijing by Trump in his first term.",

      "Last week, Francis publicly rebuked the Trump administration for its immigration crackdown and for slashing international aid, and in February, he wrote an unusual open letter to U.S. Catholic bishops saying a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201cthe initiation of a program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "The pontiff did not lead the Easter Mass, with Cardinal Angelo Comastri, a retired archpriest of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, taking his place and delivering the homily that Francis has prepared.",
      "But after the Mass ended, the pope appeared to rapturous applause as a military band kicked off a round of the Holy See and Italian anthems. Diego Ravelli, master of ceremonies, then delivered the Urbi et Orbi papal address.",
      "During the address, Francis made a strong appeal for peace around the world, particularly in Gaza, where he said \u201cterrible conflict  continues to cause death and destruction,\u201d and called for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages.",
      "The pontiff offered prayer to Christian communities in Ukraine, Israel, Lebanon and Syria, and mentioned the ongoing conflict and suffering in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Sudan, South Sudan, Myanmar, the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "\u201cI would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFor all of us are children of God!\u201d",
      "After the service, Francis took to his open-topped popemobile to greet crowds in the square, blessing babies and children during the drive.",
      "The Easter week is the most important on the Catholic calendar, but this year it had also been a test of Pope Francis\u2019 health after he spent\u00a0more than five weeks in Rome\u2019s Gemelli Hospital for treatment for pneumonia in both lungs, the most serious health crisis of his 12-year tenure.",
      "According to his doctors, his life was in danger twice during that period, and they considered ending treatment. \u201cWe had to choose whether to stop and let him go, or push forward and try everything,\u201d one of his doctors, Sergio Alfieri, said shortly after the pope was released from the hospital.",
      "Since then, Francis had made only brief public appearances, but they have provided reassuring signs of his recovery. He greeted a crowd in St Peter\u2019s Square on Palm Sunday last weekend, and on Holy Thursday he visited a Roman prison. He also met privately with\u00a0King Charles III and Queen Camilla in the Vatican earlier in the month.",
      "After Francis was discharged from the hospital in March, the head of his medical team said he would require a further two months of rest, and his doctors said it would take \u201ca lot of time\u201d for his aging body to fully heal.",
      "Throughout his illness, the Vatican maintained that Francis continued to fulfill his duties despite staying out of the public eye.",
      "Notably, he missed the Catholic Church\u2019s jubilee celebration, a significant tradition held every 50 years for the remission of sins, known as the Holy Year.",
      "The pope\u2019s declining health sparked speculation over whether he would retire just as his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, did in 2013, but there was no indication from the Vatican that he intended to do so."
